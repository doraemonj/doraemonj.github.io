First, the Mary Celestia an iron-hulled steamship carrying supplies in the American Civil War.

She left Bermuda, and she came down South Shore and came to her demise right here.

>   Which is a very curious thing because we're literally only under meters I'm sure. 

It happened on a flat calm day

There's a lot of intrigue about it.

Trying to figure out just how this came to be.

She lies only about fifty feet down.

The ship's distinctive paddle wheel is still recognizable.

Just around the coast, there's another wreck, the Constellation.

And slightly farther yet another, the Montana.

In fact, according to Philippe's records, numerous wrecks completely encircle Bermuda.
