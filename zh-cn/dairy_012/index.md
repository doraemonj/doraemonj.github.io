# 人文课程开始


从今天开始，我给Amy和Alice准备一个长期、甚至是超长期的专栏，涵盖思想、历史、人文、逻辑、艺术等，基本脉络是沿着Liberty Arts（通识教育、博雅教育、自由技艺）的方向走，在此放上链接，这个链接可能会事随境迁、时隐时现，但这不重要，重要的是我们经历人类历史的同时，已然经历过我们自己内心的冲动、好奇和感悟。

换一个角度，人始终无法拥有他自己没有理解的身外之物，财富如此，智慧如此，自由亦如此。从『拥有』到更高程度的理解，到更高程度的拥有，这是一个绕不过去的循环。想绕过这个循环的，应该没有理解这个循环。

今天终于进一步理解：在网络上，有一篇真正属于自己的自耕地，比写一万篇文章都重要。

继续读书，Navel Ravikant的宝典第四部分P71-91

>   When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgements about them, they will feel it. HUmans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset.

>   Optimists actually do better in the long run.

>   The business world many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the world.

>   Money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it's going to solve all of your money problems. People realize that, so they want to make money.

>   Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.

>   That's why you should avoid status games in your life -- they make you into an angry, combative person. You're always fighting to put other people down, to put your-self and the people you like up.

>   Figure out what you're good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don't measure -- your patience will run out if you cout.

>   An old boss once warned: "You'll never be rich since you're obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that's just good enough."

>   What you relly want if freedom.

>   What is your definition of retirement? Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you're retired.

>   The way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic, to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody. You konw how to do it better because you love it, and no one can compete with you.

>   To me , creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it's fun, because I'm into the product.

>   I'm always "working." It looks like work to others, but it feels like play to me. And that's how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I'm just playing, for sixteen hours a day.

>   I value freddom above everything else. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don't want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. For me, freedom is my number one value.

>   The winners of any game are the people who are so addicted they continue playing even as the marginal utility from winning declines.

>   My co-founder Nivi said, "In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rick." I think that is a brilliant formulatiojn.

>   I have a much more comfortable philosophy: "Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you."

>   Sharks eat well but live a life surrounded by sharks.

>   I just have this saying inside my head: "The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be."

>   Don't keep track, and don't keep cout because if you do , you will run out of time.

>   People are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve.
>
>   Always pay it forward. And don't keep cout.

>   Your real resume is just a catalog of all your suffering.

>   Amazing how many people confuse wealth and wisdom.



今天看到政经孙老师一个想当惊人的[观点](https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxvnsq9n81L5pdeKc7RLjERdxGCy9zOsC5)：

>   【人的本质是丧尸】血缘和种族，都是知识的事后追认，方便建立知识谱係的树状结构图。可是，生物的本质从来就不是遗传和血缘，而是感染和变异。把共时性的变异强说成是历史性的遗传，这是形而上学家的专长。我之前曾经说人类本质上是不同类型的猴子，这个说法过于布尔乔亚趣味。如果扒开猴子的皮，你会发现人的本质其实是感染了不同类型病毒的丧尸，这些丧尸之间又重複交叉感染，产生新类型的丧尸。传统的达尔文主义者把这种共时性的交叉感染过程按照树状的理性知识结构进行重新归类，创造出进化论。实际上最底层的逻辑当中并不存在进化，只存在交叉感染。人类的理性思维结构貌似一颗主次分明，有主干、有枝丫的无花果树，但如果从更宏观的结构来观察，理性只是近乎无数种可能性中的一种，世界的宏观结构不是中心化的树状结构，而是去中心化的块茎结构，也就是说，我们并不是生活在井然有序的理性之树下，而是生活在横向肆意生长的非理性土豆裡面。总结就是：一群与土豆同构的，不停交叉感染的丧尸。
