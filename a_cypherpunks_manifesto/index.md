A Cypherpunk's Manifesto

赛博朋克的宣言by Eric Hughes埃里克-休斯
作者：Eric Hughes
Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
在电子时代，隐私对于一个开放的社会是必要的。隐私不是秘密。私事是一个人不想让整个世界知道的事情，但秘密是一个人不想让任何人知道的事情。隐私是有选择地将自己暴露给世界的权力。
If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties. The power of electronic communications has enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it to.
如果两方有某种交易，那么每一方都有关于他们互动的记忆。每一方都可以谈论他们自己的记忆；谁能阻止它呢？人们可以通过法律来阻止它，但言论自由，甚至比隐私更重要，是一个开放社会的根本；我们力求不限制任何言论。如果许多方面在同一个论坛上一起发言，每个人都可以对所有其他人发言，并将有关个人和其他方面的知识汇总在一起。电子通信的力量使这种群体言论成为可能，它不会仅仅因为我们可能希望它消失而消失。
Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.
由于我们渴望隐私，我们必须确保交易的每一方只知道该交易直接需要的信息。由于任何信息都可以被说出来，我们必须确保我们尽可能少地透露信息。在大多数情况下，个人身份并不突出。当我在商店购买一本杂志并把现金交给店员时，没有必要知道我是谁。当我要求我的电子邮件供应商发送和接收信息时，我的供应商不需要知道我在和谁说话，或者我在说什么，或者别人在对我说什么；我的供应商只需要知道如何把信息送到那里，以及我欠他们多少费用。当我的身份被交易的基本机制所揭示时，我就没有了隐私。我不能在这里有选择地暴露自己；我必须始终暴露自己。
Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.
因此，在一个开放的社会中，隐私需要匿名的交易系统。到目前为止，现金一直是主要的此类系统。匿名交易系统不是一个秘密交易系统。一个匿名系统使个人能够在需要的时候透露他们的身份，而且只在需要的时候透露；这就是隐私的本质。
Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.
在一个开放的社会中，隐私也需要密码学。如果我说了什么，我希望只有那些我想说的人听到。如果我说话的内容可以被全世界知道，我就没有隐私。加密就是表明对隐私的渴望，而用弱加密技术加密就是表明对隐私没有太多渴望。此外，在默认为匿名的情况下，要有把握地揭示自己的身份，就需要加密签名。
We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.
我们不能指望政府、公司或其他大型的、不露面的组织出于善意而给予我们隐私。谈论我们对他们来说是有利的，我们应该期望他们会谈论。试图阻止他们的言论是在与信息的现实作斗争。信息不只是想要自由，它还渴望自由。信息的扩展是为了填补可用的存储空间。信息是谣言的年轻、强壮的表弟；信息比谣言的脚步更灵活，有更多的眼睛，知道更多，理解更少。
We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
如果我们希望拥有隐私，我们必须捍卫自己的隐私。我们必须走到一起，创建允许匿名交易的系统。几个世纪以来，人们一直在用耳语、黑暗、信封、封闭的门、秘密的握手和信使来捍卫自己的隐私。过去的技术不允许有强大的隐私，但电子技术允许。
We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.
我们Cypherpunks致力于建立匿名系统。我们正在用密码学、匿名邮件转发系统、数字签名和电子货币来捍卫我们的隐私。
Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks写代码。我们知道，必须有人写软件来捍卫隐私，既然我们不能得到隐私，除非我们都这样做，那么我们就要写软件。我们公布我们的代码，以便我们的Cypherpunks同伴可以练习和玩弄它。我们的代码对全世界的人都是免费使用的。如果你不赞成我们写的软件，我们也不太在意。我们知道，软件是不能被摧毁的，一个广泛分散的系统是不能被关闭的。
Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence. Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.
Cypherpunks痛惜对密码学的规定，因为加密从根本上说是一种私人行为。事实上，加密行为将信息从公共领域移除。即使是针对密码学的法律，也只能达到一个国家的边界和它的暴力手臂。加密技术将不可避免地在全球范围内传播，随之而来的是它使匿名交易系统成为可能。
For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.
为了使隐私得到普及，它必须成为社会契约的一部分。人们必须为了共同的利益来共同部署这些系统。隐私只有在社会中的伙伴们的合作下才会延伸。我们Cypherpunks寻求你的问题和你的关注，并希望我们能与你接触，以便我们不自欺欺人。然而，我们不会因为有人不同意我们的目标而偏离我们的方向。
The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.
Cypherpunks正积极致力于使网络对隐私更安全。让我们一起快速前进。
Onward.
继续前进。
