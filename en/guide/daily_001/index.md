# Immigrate Daily 001: Beginning


On May 11, 2022, I started preparing for migration.

After comparing several immigration targets in the previous period, including the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, I decided to move to the latter one, taking into account my own situation.

Advantages: The number of immigrants admitted is relatively high, especially IT technology, which suits me. And if it happens to be equally suitable for you, then you can use me as a test agent.

Disadvantages: Cold and prone to earthquakes, BC (British Columbia) is in the Pacific Rim volcanic earthquake zone.

Blogger's own conditions:

Male, 37 years old. With a bachelor degree of Economics of an Chinese university. I have worked for three banks for 14 years, including 3 years of data analysis work experience.

The blog will be updated in bilingual format later:  English and Chinese .
