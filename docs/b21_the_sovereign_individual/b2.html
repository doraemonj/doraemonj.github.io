<p class="calibre1">by James Dale Davidson &amp; Lord William Rees-Mogg Simon &amp; Schuster 1997</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER 1 THE TRANSITION IN THE YEAR 2000</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">"It feels like something big is about to happen: graphs show us the yearly growth  of  populations,  atmospheric  concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide, Web addresses, and Mbytes per dollar. They all soar up to an asymptote just  beyond  the  turn  of  the  century:  The  Singularity.  The  end  of everything  we  know.  The  beginning  of  something  we  may  never</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-3"></a>The  coming  of  the  year  2000  has  haunted  the  Western  imagination  for the past thousand years. Ever since the world failed to end at the turn of the  first  millennium  after  Christ,  theologians,  evangelists,  poets,  and seers  have  looked  to  the  end  of  this  decade  with  an  expectation  that  it would  bring  something  momentous.  No  less  an  authority  than  Isaac Newton speculated that the world would end with the year 2000. Michel de Nostradamus, whose prophecies have been read by every generation since  they  were  first  1  Danny  Hillis,  "The  Millennium  Clock,"  Wired, Special Edition, Fall 1995, p.48. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#calibre_link-1">published  in  1568,  forecast  the  coming  of  the  Third  Antichrist  in  July</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#calibre_link-1">1999.2  Swiss  psychologist  Carl  Jung,  connoisseur  of  the  "collective</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">unconscious," envisioned the birth of a New Age in 1997. Such forecasts may easily be ridiculed, but there is no denying that they excite a morbid fascination at a time when many are not entirely sure what to believe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A sense of disquiet about the future has begun to color the optimism so characteristic  of  Western  societies  for  the  past  250  years.  People everywhere are hesitant and worried. You see it in their faces. Hear it in their  conversation.  See  it  reflected  in  polls  and  registered  in  the  ballot box.  Just  as  an  invisible,  physical  change  of  ions  in  the  atmosphere signals  that  a  thunderstorm  is  imminent  even  before  the  clouds  darken and  lightning  strikes,  so  now,  in  the  twilight  of  the  millennium, premonitions of change are in the air. One person after another, each in his own way, senses that time is running out on a dying way of life. As the  decade  expires,  a  murderous  century  expires  with  it,  and  also  a glorious millennium of human accomplishment. All draw to a close with the year 2000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We believe that the modern phase of Western civilization will end with it. This book tells why. Like many earlier works, it is an attempt to see into a glass darkly, to sketch out the vague shapes and dimensions of a future  that  is  still  to  be.  In  that  sense,  we  mean  our  work  to  be apocalyptic  in  the  original  meaning  of  the  word.  Apokalypsis  means</p>

<p class="calibre1">"unveiling" in Greek. We believe that a new stage in history-the age of the Sovereign Individual is about to be "unveiled." </p>

<p class="calibre1">2</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-4"></a>"Violence  shall  no  more  be  heard  in  thy  land,  wasting  nor  destruction within thy borders." ISAIAH 60:18</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE FOURTH STAGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  theme  of  this  book  is  the  new  revolution  of  power  which  is liberating individuals at the expense of the twentiethcentury nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Innovations  that  alter  the  logic  of  violence  in  unprecedented  ways  are transforming  the  boundaries  within  which  the  future  must  lie.  If  our deductions are correct, you stand at the threshold of the most sweeping revolution  in  history.  Faster  than  all  but  a  few  now  imagine, microprocessing  will  subvert  and  destroy  the  nationstate,  creating  new forms of social organization in the process. This will be far from an easy transformation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The challenge it will pose will be all the greater because it will happen with incredible speed compared with anything seen in the past. Through all  of  human  history  from  its  earliest  beginnings  until  now,  there  have been only three basic stages of economic life. (1) hunting-and-gathering societies;  (2)  agricultural  societies;  and  (3)  industrial  societies.  Now, looming over the horizon, is something entirely new, the fourth stage of social organization: information societies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Each of the previous stages of society has corresponded with distinctly different phases in the evolution and control of violence. As we explain in detail, information societies promise to dramatically reduce the returns to  violence,  in  part  because  they  transcend  locality.  If  the  new millennium,  the  advantage  of  controlling  violence  on  a  2  Ericka Cheetham,  The  Final  Prophecies  of  Nostradamus  (New  York: Putnam,1989), p.424. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2</p>

<p class="calibre1">large scale will be far lower than it has been at any time since before the French Revolution. This will have profound consequences. One of these will be rising crime. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  the  payoff  for  organizing  violence  at  a  large  scale  tumbles,  the payoff from violence at a smaller scale is likely to jump. Violence will 3</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-5"></a>become more random and localized. Organized crime will grow in scope. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We explain why. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another logical implication of falling returns to violence is the eclipse of politics. There is much evidence that adherence to the civic myths of the twentiethcentury  nationstate  is  rapidly  eroding.  The  death  of Communism  is  merely  the  most  striking  example.  As  we  explore  in detail, the collapse of morality and growing corruption among leaders of Western  governments  is  not  a  random  development.  It  is  evidence  that the potential of the nationstate is exhausted. Even many of its leaders no longer  believe  the  platitudes  they  mouth.  Nor  are  they  believed  by others. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">History Repeats Itself</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  situation  with  striking  parallels  in  the  past.  Whenever technological change has divorced the old forms from the new moving forces  of  the  economy,  moral  standards  shift,  and  people  begin  to  treat those  in  command  of  the  old  institutions  with  growing  disdain.  This widespread  revulsion  often  comes  into  evidence  well  before  people develop a new coherent ideology of change. So it was in the late fifteenth century,  when  the  medieval  Church  was  the  predominant  institution  of feudalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  popular  belief  in  "the  sacredness  of  the  sacerdotal office," both the higher and lower ranks of clergy were held in the utmost contempt-not  unlike  the  popular  attitude  toward  politicians  and bureaucrats today. 3</p>

<p class="calibre1">We believe that much can be learned by analogy between the situation at the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century,  when  life  had  become  thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and the situation today, when the world has become saturated with politics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  costs  of  supporting  institutionalized  religion  at  the  end  of  the fifteenth  century  had  reached  a  historic  extreme,  much  as  the  costs  of supporting government have reached a senile extreme today. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-6"></a>We  know  what  happened  to  organized  religion  in  the  wake  of  the Gunpowder  Revolution.  Technological  developments  created  strong incentives  to  downsize  religious  institutions  and  lower  their  costs.  A similar  technological  revolution  is  destined  to  downsize  radically  the nationstate early in the new millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Information Revolution</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  the  breakdown  of  large  systems  accelerates,  systematic  compulsion will  recede  as  a  factor  shaping  economic  life  and  the  distribution  of income. Efficiency will rapidly become more important than the dictates of power in the organization of social institutions. An entirely new realm of economic activity that is not hostage to physical violence will emerge in  cyberspace.  The  most  obvious  benefits  will  flow  to  the  "cognitive elite,"  who  will  increasingly  operate  outside  political  boundaries.  They are 3</p>

<p class="calibre1">already  equally  home  in  Frankfurt,  London,  New  York,  Buenos  Aires, Los  Angeles,  Tokyo,  and  Hong  Kong.  Incomes  will  become  more unequal within jurisdictions and more equal between them. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The Sovereign Individual</i> explores the social and financial consequences of this revolutionary change. Our desire is to help you to take advantage of  the  opportunities  of  the  new  age  and  avoid  being  destroyed  by  its impact. If only half of what we expect to see happens, you face change of a magnitude with few precedents in history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  transformation  of  the  year  2000  will  not  only  revolutionize  the character  of  the  world  economy,  it  will  do  so  more  rapidly  than  any previous  phase  change.  Unlike  the  Agricultural  Revolution,  the Information Revolution will not take millennia to do its work. Unlike the Industrial Revolution. its impact will not be spread over centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Information Revolution will happen within a lifetime. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What is more, it will happen almost everywhere at once. Technical and economic innovations will no longer be confined to small portions of the globe. The transformation will be all but universal. And it will involve a break  with  the  past  so  profound  that  it  will  almost  bring  to  life  the 5</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-7"></a>magical domain of the gods as imagined by the early agricultural peoples like  the  ancient  Greeks.  To  a  greater  degree  than  most  would  now  be willing to concede, it will prove difficult or impossible to preserve many contemporary  institutions  in  the  new  millennium.  When  information societies take shape they will be as different from industrial societies as the Greece of Aeschylus was from the world of the cave dwellers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">PROMETHEUS  UNBOUND:  THE  RISE  OF  THE  SOVEREIGN</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">INDIVIDUAL</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The coming transformation is both good news and bad. The good news is that the Information Revolution will liberate individuals as never before. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  time,  those  who  can  educate  themselves  will  be  almost entirely free to invent their own work and realize the full benefits of their own  productivity.  Genius  will  be  unleashed,  freed  from  both  the oppression of government and the drags of racial and ethnic prejudice. In the Information Society, no one who is truly able will be detained by the ill-formed opinions of others. It will not matter what most of the people on  earth  might  think  of  your  race,  your  looks,  your  age,  your  sexual proclivities, or the way you wear your hair. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the cybereconomy, they will never see you. The ugly, the fat, the old, the  disabled  will  vie  with  the  young  and  beautiful  on  equal  terms  in utterly color-blind anonymity on the new frontiers of cyberspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Ideas Become Wealth</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Merit,  wherever  it  arises,  will  be  rewarded  as  never  before.  In  an environment  where  the  greatest  source  of  wealth  will  be  the  ideas  you have in your head rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly will potentially be rich. The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of humans in parts of the world that never shared fully in the 4</p>

<p class="calibre1">prosperity  of  industrial  society.  The  brightest,  most  successful  and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At  the  highest  plateau  of  productivity,  these  Sovereign  Individuals  will compete and interact on terms that echo the relations among the gods in 6</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-8"></a>Greek myth. The elusive Mount Olympus of the next millennium will be in  cyberspace-a  realm  without  physical  existence  that  will  nonetheless develop what promises to be the world's largest economy by the second decade  of  the  new  millennium.  By  2025,  the  cybereconomy  will  have many millions of participants. Some of them will be as rich as Bill Gates, worth over $10 billion each. The cyberpoor may be those with an income of  less  than  $200,000  a  year.  There  will  be  no  cyberwelfare.  No cybertaxes  and  no  cybergovernment.  The  cybereconomy,  rather  than China,  could  well  be  the  greatest  economic  phenomenon  of  the  next thirty years. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  good  news  is  that  politicians  will  no  more  be  able  to  dominate, suppress,  and  regulate  the  greater  part  of  commerce  in  this  new  realm than the legislators of the ancient Greek city-states could have trimmed the beard of Zeus. The liberation of a large part of the global economy from political control will oblige all remaining forms of government to operate  on  more  nearly  market  terms.  They  will  ultimately  have  little choice  but  to  treat  populations  in  territories  they  serve  more  like customers, and less in the way that organized criminals treat the victims of a shakedown racket. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Beyond Politics</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">What  mythology  described  as  the  province  of  the  gods  will  become  a viable  option  for  the  individual-a  life  outside  the  reach  of  kings  and councils. First in scores, then in hundreds, and ultimately in the millions, individuals  will  escape  the  shackles  of  politics.  As  they  do,  they  will transform  the  character  of  governments,  shrinking  the  realm  of compulsion and widening the scope of private control over resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  emergence  of  the  sovereign  individual  will  demonstrate  yet  again the  strange  prophetic  power  of  myth.  Conceiving  little  of  the  laws  of nature,  the  early  agricultural  peoples  imagined  that  "powers  we  should call supernatural" were widely distributed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  powers  were  sometimes  employed  by  men,  sometimes  by</p>

<p class="calibre1">"incarnate human gods" </p>

<p class="calibre1">7</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-9"></a>who looked like men and interacted with them in what Sir James George Frazer described in The Golden Bough as "a great democracy" 4</p>

<p class="calibre1">When  the  ancients  imagined  the  children  of  Zeus  living  among  them they  were  inspired  by  a  deep  belief  in  magic.  They  shared  with  other primitive  agricultural  peoples  an  awe  of  nature,  and  a  superstitious conviction that nature's works were set in motion by individual volition, by  magic.  In  that  sense,  there  was  nothing  self-consciously  prophetic about  their  view  of  nature  and  their  gods.  They  were  far  from anticipating microtechnology. They could not have imagined its impact in  altering  the  marginal  productivity  of  individuals  thousands  of  years later.  They  certainly  could  not  have  foreseen  how  it  would  shift  the balance  between  power  and  efficiency  and  thus  revolutionize  the  way that  assets  are  created  and  protected.  Yet  what  they  imagined  as  they spun their myths has a strange resonance with the world you are likely to see. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Alt.Abracadabra</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The "abracadabra" of the magic invocation, for example. bears a curious similarity  to  the  password  employed  to  access  a  computer.  In  some respects, high-speed computation has already made it possible to mimic the  magic  of  the  genie.  Early  generations  of  "digital  servants"  already obey  the  commands  of  those  who  control  the  computers  in  which  they are sealed much as genies were sealed in magic lamps. The virtual reality of  information  technology  will  widen  the  realm  of  human  wishes  to make almost anything that can be imagined seem real. Telepresence will give living individuals the same capacity to span distance at supernatural speed  and  monitor  events  from  afar  that  the  Greeks  supposed  was enjoyed  by  Hermes  and  Apollo.  The  Sovereign  Individuals  of  the Information  Age,  like  the  gods  of  ancient  and  primitive  myths,  will  in due  course  enjoy  a  kind  of  "diplomatic  immunity"  from  most  of  the political  woes  that  have  beset  mortal  human  beings  in  most  times  and places. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The new Sovereign Individual will operate like the gods of myth in the same  physical  environment  as  the  ordinary,  subject  citizen,  but  in  a 8</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-10"></a>separate realm politically. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Commanding  vastly  greater  resources  and  beyond  the  reach  of  many forms  of  compulsion,  the  Sovereign  Individual  will  redesign governments and reconfigure economies in the new millennium. The full implications of this change are all but unimaginable. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Genius and Nemesis</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">For  anyone  who  loves  human  aspiration  and  success,  the  Information Age  will  provide  a  bounty.  That  is  surely  the  best  news  in  many generations. But it is bad news as well, The new organization of society implied by the triumph of individual autonomy and the true equalization of opportunity based upon merit will lead to very great rewards for merit and  great  individual  autonomy.  This  will  leave  individuals  far  more responsible  for  themselves  than  they  have  been  accustomed  to  being during the industrial period. It will also reduce the unearned advantage in living  standards  that  has  been  enjoyed  by  residents  of  advanced industrial societies throughout the twentieth century. As we write, the top 15 percent of the world's population have an average per-capita income of  $21,000  annually.  The  remaining  85  percent  of  the  world  have  an average income of just $1,000. That huge, hoarded advantage from the past  is  bound  to  dissipate  under  the  new  conditions  of  the  Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As it does, the capacity of nationstates to redistribute income on a large scale  will  collapse.  Information  technology  facilitates  dramatically increased competition between jurisdictions. When technology is mobile, and  transactions  occur  in  cyberspace,  as  they  increasingly  will  do, governments will no longer be able to charge more for their services than they are worth to the people who pay for them. Anyone with a portable computer  and  a  satellite  link  will  be  able  to  conduct  almost  any information business 6</p>

<p class="calibre1">anywhere, and that includes almost the whole of the world's multitrillion-dollar financial transactions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  means  that  you  will  no  longer  be  obliged  to  live  in  a  high-tax jurisdiction in order to earn high income. In the future, when most wealth 9</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-11"></a>can  be  earned  anywhere,  and  even  spent  anywhere,  governments  that attempt  to  charge  too  much  as  the  price  of  domicile  will  merely  drive away their best customers. If our reasoning is correct, and we believe it is,  the  nationstate  as  we  know  it  will  not  survive  in  anything  like  its present form. </p>

<p class="calibre1">10</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-12"></a><b class="calibre4">THE END OF NATIONS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Changes  that  diminish  the  power  of  predominant  institutions  are  both unsettling and dangerous. Just as monarchs, lords, popes, and potentates fought  ruthlessly  to  preserve  their  accustomed  privileges  in  the  early stages  of  the  modern  period,  so  today's  governments  will  employ violence, often of a covert and arbitrary kind, in the attempt to hold back the  clock.  Weakened  by  the  challenge  from  technology,  the  state  will treat  increasingly  autonomous  individuals,  its  former  citizens,  with  the same range of ruthlessness and diplomacy it has heretofore displayed in its  dealing  with  other  governments.  Increasingly  harsh  techniques  of exaction  will  be  a  logical  corollary  of  the  emergence  of  a  new  type  of bargaining between governments and individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technology  will  make  individuals  more  nearly  sovereign  than  ever before.  And  they  will  be  treated  that  way.  Sometimes  violently,  as enemies, sometimes as equal parties in negotiation, sometimes as allies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  however  ruthlessly  governments  behave,  particularly  in  the transition period, wedding the IRS with the CIA will avail them little. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  be  increasingly  required  by  the  press  of  necessity  to  bargain with autonomous individuals whose resources will no longer be so easily controlled. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The changes implied by the Information Revolution will not only create a  fiscal  crisis  for  governments,  they  will  tend  to  disintegrate  all  large structures.  Fourteen  empires  have  disappeared  already  in  the  twentieth century. The breakdown of empires is part of a process that will dissolve the  nationstate  itself.  Government  will  have  to  adapt  to  the  growing autonomy of the individual. Taxing capacity will plunge by 50~70</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent.  This  will  tend  to  make  smaller  jurisdictions  more  successful. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The challenge of setting competitive terms to attract able individuals and their  capital  will  be  more  easily  undertaken  in  enclaves  than  across continents. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  as  the  modern  nationstate  decomposes,  latter-day barbarians  will  increasingly  come  to  exercise  power  behind  the  scenes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">11</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-13"></a>Groups  like  the  Russian  mafiya,  which  picks  the  bones  of  the  former Soviet  Union,  other  ethnic  criminal  gangs,  nomenklaturas*,  drug  lords, and renegade covert agencies will be laws unto themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  already  are.  Far  more  than  is  widely  understood,  the  modem barbarians  have  already  infiltrated  the  forms  of  the  nationstate  without greatly changing its appearances. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  are  microparasites  feeding  on  a  dying  system.  As  violent  and unscrupulous as a state at war, these groups employ the techniques of the state on a smaller scale. Their growing influence and power are part of the downsizing of politics. Microprocessing reduces the size that groups must attain in order to be effective in the use and control of 7</p>

<p class="calibre1">violence.  As  this  technological  revolution  unfolds,  predatory  violence will  be  organized  more  and  more  outside  of  central  control.  Efforts  to contain  violence  will  also  devolve  in  ways  that  depend  more  upon efficiency than magnitude of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">* Nomenklatunas are the entrenched elites that ruled the former Soviet Union and other state-run economies. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">History in Reverse</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  process  by  which  the  nationstate  grew  over  the  past  five  centuries will be put into reverse by the new logic of the Information Age. Local centers  of  power  will  reassert  themselves  as  the  state  devolves  into fragmented, overlapping sovereignties.5</p>

<p class="calibre1">The growing power of organized crime is merely one reflection of this tendency. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Multinational  companies  are  already  having  to  subcontract  all  but essential  work.  Some  conglomerates,  such  as  AT&amp;T,  Unisys,  and  ITT, have  split  themselves  into  several  firms  in  order  to  function  more profitably. The nationstate will devolve like an unwieldy conglomerate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not only is power in the world changing, but the work of the world is changing as well. Microprocessing has created entirely new horizons of economic  activity  that  transcend  territorial  boundaries.  This 12</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-14"></a>transcendence  of  frontiers  and  territories  is  perhaps  the  most revolutionary  development  since  Adam  and  Eve  straggled  out  of paradise  under  the  sentence  of  their  Maker:  "In  the  sweat  of  thy  face shalt thou eat bread. "As technology revolutionizes the tools we use, it also antiquates our laws, reshapes our morals, and alters our perceptions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This book explains how. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Microprocessing and rapidly improving communications already make it possible for the individual to choose where to work. Transactions on the Internet  or  the  World  Wide  Web  can  be  encrypted  and  will  soon  be almost impossible for tax collectors to capture. Tax-free money already compounds far faster offshore than onshore funds still subject to the high tax burden imposed by the twentiethcentury nationstate. After the turn of the millennium, much of the world's commerce will migrate into the new realm  of  cyberspace,  a  region  where  governments  will  have  no  more dominion  than  they  exercise  over  the  bottom  of  the  sea  or  the  outer planets. In cyberspace. the threats of physical violence that have been the alpha  and  omega  of  politics  since  time  immemorial  will  vanish.  In cyberspace,  the  meek  and  the  mighty  will  meet  on  equal  terms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Cyberspace  is  the  ultimate  offshore  jurisdiction.  An  economy  with  no taxes. Bermuda in the sky with diamonds. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When this greatest tax haven of them all is fully open for business, all funds will essentially be offshore funds at the discretion of their owner. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  have  cascading  consequences.  The  state  has  grown  used  to treating its taxpayers as a farmer treats his cows, keeping them in a field to be milked. Soon, the cows will have wings. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Revenge of Nations</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">8</p>

<p class="calibre1">Like an angry farmer, the state will no doubt take desperate measures at first  to  tether  and  hobble  its  escaping  herd.  It  will  employ  covert  and even  violent  means  to  restrict  access  to  liberating  technologies.  Such expedients  will  work  only  temporarily,  if  at  all.  The  twentiethcentury nationstate,  with  all  its  pretensions,  will  starve  to  death  as  its  tax revenues decline. </p>

<p class="calibre1">13</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-15"></a>When the state finds itself unable to meet its committed expenditure by raising  tax  revenues,  it  will  resort  to  other,  more  desperate  measures. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Among  them  is  printing  money.  Governments  have  grown  used  to enjoying  a  monopoly  over  currency  that  they  could  depreciate  at  will. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  arbitrary  inflation  has  been  a  prominent  feature  of  the  monetary policy of all twentiethcentury states. Even the best national currency of the postwar period, the German mark, lost 71 percent of its value from January 1, 1949, through the end of June 1995. In the same period, the U.S.  dollar  lost  84  percent  of  its  value.6  This  inflation  had  the  same effect as a tax on all who hold the currency. As we explore later, inflation as  revenue  option  will  be  largely  foreclosed  by  the  emergence  of cybermoney.  New  technologies  will  allow  the  holders  of  wealth  to bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money in the  modern  period.  The  state  will  continue  to  control  the  industrial-era printing presses, but their importance for controlling the world's wealth will  be  transcended  by  mathematical  algorithms  that  have  no  physical existence.  In  the  new  millennium,  cybermoney  controlled  by  private markets will supersede flat money issued by governments. Only the poor will be victims of inflation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lacking their accustomed scope to tax and inflate, governments, even in traditionally  civil  countries,  will  turn  nasty.  As  income  tax  becomes uncollectable,  older  and  more  arbitrary  methods  of  exaction  will resurface. The ultimate form of withholding tax--de facto or even overt hostage-taking  will  be  introduced  by  governments  desperate  to  prevent wealth from escaping beyond their reach. Unlucky individuals will find themselves  singled  out  and  held  to  ransom  in  an  almost  medieval fashion.  Businesses  that  offer  services  that  facilitate  the  realization  of autonomy  by  individuals  will  be  subject  to  infiltration,  sabotage,  and disruption. Arbitrary forfeiture of property, already commonplace in the United States, where it occurs five thousand times a week, will become even more pervasive. Governments will violate human rights, censor the free  flow  of  information,  sabotage  useful  technologies,  and  worse.  For the  same  reasons  that  the  late,  departed  Soviet  Union  tried  in  vain  to suppress  access  to  personal  computers  and  Xerox  machines,  western governments  will  seek  to  suppress  the  cybereconomy  by  totalitarian means. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-16"></a><b class="calibre4">RETURN OF THE LUDDITES</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Such methods may prove popular among some population segments. The good news about individual liberation and autonomy will seem to be bad news  to  many  who  are  not  among  the  cognitive  elite.  The  greatest resentment  is  likely  to  be  centered  among  those  of  middle  talent  in currently  rich  countries.  They  particularly  may  come  to  feel  that information  technology  poses  a  threat  to  their  way  of  life.  The beneficiaries  of  organized  compulsion,  including  millions  receiving income redistributed by governments, may 9</p>

<p class="calibre1">resent  the  new  freedom  realized  by  Sovereign  Individuals.  Their  upset will illustrate the truism that "where you stand is determined by where you sit." </p>

<p class="calibre1">It would be misleading, however, to attribute all the bad feelings that will be generated in the coming transition crisis to the bald desire to live at someone  else's  expense.  More  will  be  involved.  The  very  character  of human  society  suggests  that  there  is  bound  to  be  a  misguided  moral dimension  to  the  coming  Luddite  reaction.  Think  of  it  as  a  bald  desire fitted  with  a  moral  toupee.  We  explore  the  moral  and  moralistic dimensions  of  the  transition  crisis.  Self-interested  grasping  of  a conscious  kind  has  far  less  power  to  motivate  actions  than  does  self-righteous  fury.  While  adherence  to  the  civic  myths  of  the  twentieth century is rapidly falling away, they are not without their true believers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Everyone who came of age in the twentieth century has been inculcated in the duties and obligations of the twentiethcentury citizen. The residual moral  imperatives  from  industrial  society  will  stimulate  at  least  some neo-Luddite attacks on information technologies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In this sense, this violence to come will be at least partially an expression of what we call "moral anachronism," the application of moral strictures drawn from one stage of economic life to the circumstances of another. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Every  stage  of  society  requires  its  own  moral  rules  to  help  individuals overcome  incentive  traps  peculiar  to  the  choices  they  face  in  that particular  way  of  life.  Just  as  a  farming  society  could  not  live  by  the moral  rules  of  a  migratory  Eskimo  band,  so  the  Information  Society 15</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-17"></a>cannot satisfy moral imperatives that emerged to facilitate the success of a militant twentiethcentury industrial state. We explain why. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the next few years, moral anachronism will be in evidence at the core countries of the West in much the way that it has been witnessed at the periphery  over  the  past  five  centuries.  Western  colonists  and  military expeditions  stimulated  such  crises  when  they  encountered  indigenous hunting-and-gathering  bands,  as  well  as  peoples  whose  societies  were still  organized  for  farming.  The  introduction  of  new  technologies  into anachronistic settings caused confusion and moral crises. The success of Christian missionaries in converting millions of indigenous peoples can be  laid  in  large  measure  to  the  local  crises  caused  by  the  sudden introduction  of  new  power  arrangements  from  the  outside.  Such encounters  recurred  over  and  over,  from  the  sixteenth  century  through the  early  decades  of  the  twentieth  century.  We  expect  similar  clashes early  in  the  new  millennium  as  Information  Societies  supplant  those organized along industrial lines. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Nostalgia for Compulsion</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  rise  of  the  Sovereign  Individual  will  not  be  wholly  welcomed  as promising new phase of history, even among those who benefit from it most.  Everyone  will  feel  some  misgivings.  And  many  will  despise innovations  that  undermine  the  territorial  nationstate.  It  is  a  fact  of human nature that radical change of any kind is almost always seen as a dramatic  turn  for  the  worse.  Five  hundred  years  ago,  the  courtiers gathered  around  the  duke  of  Burgundy  would  have  said  that  unfolding innovations  that  undermined  feudalism  were  evil.  They  thought  the world was rapidly spiraling downhill 10</p>

<p class="calibre1">at the very time that later historians saw an explosion of human potential in  the  Renaissance.  Likewise,  what  may  someday  be  seen  as  a  new Renaissance  from  the  perspective  of  the  next  millennium  will  look frightening to tired twentieth century eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There is a high probability that some who are offended by the new ways as well as many who are disadvantaged by them, will react unpleasantly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  nostalgia  for  compulsion  will  probably  turn  violent.  Encounters 16</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-18"></a>with these new "Luddites" will make the transition to radical new forms of social organization at least a measure of bad news for everyone. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Get ready to duck</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">With the speed of change outracing the moral and economic capacity of many in living generations to adapt, you can expect to see a fierce and indignant  resistance  to  the  Information  Revolution,  notwithstanding  its great promise to liberate the future. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You must understand and prepare for such unpleasantness. A transition crisis lies ahead. The new information and communication technologies are  more  subversive  of  the  modern  state  than  any  political  threat  to  its predominance since Columbus sailed. This is important because those in power have seldom reacted peacefully to developments that undermined their authority. They are not likely to now. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The clash between the new and the old will shape the early years of the new  millennium.  We  expect  it  to  be  a  time  of  great  danger  and  great reward  and  a  time  of  much  diminished  civility  in  some  realms  and unprecedented scope in others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Increasingly  autonomous  individuals  and  bankrupt,  desperate governments will confront one another across a new divide. We expect to see  a  radical  restructuring  of  the  nature  of  sovereignty  and  the  virtual death of politics before the transition is over instead of state domination and  control  of  resources,  you  are  destined  to  see  the  privatization  of almost  all  services  governments  now  provide.  For  inescapable  reasons that  we  explore  at  length  in  this  book,  information  technology  will, destroy the capacity of the state to charge more for its services than they are worth to the people who pay for them. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Sovereignty Through Markets</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  an  extent  that  few  would  have  imagined  only  a  decade  ago, individuals will achieve increasing autonomy over territorial nationstates through market mechanisms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">All nationstates face bankruptcy and the rapid erosion of their authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mighty as they are, the power they retain is the power to obliterate, not 17</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-19"></a>to  command.  Their  intercontinental  missiles  and  aircraft  carriers  are already  artifacts,  as  imposing  and  useless  as  the  last  warhorse  of feudalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Information technology makes possible a dramatic extension of markets by  altering  the  way  that  assets  are  created  and  protected.  This  is revolutionary indeed, it promises to be more revolutionary for industrial society than the advent of gunpowder proved to be for feudal agriculture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The transformation of the year 2000 implies the 11</p>

<p class="calibre1">commercialization of sovereignty and the death of politics, no less than guns implied the demise of oath-based feudalism. Citizenship will go the way of chivalry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  the  age  of  individual  economic  sovereignty  is  coming. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Just as steel mills, telephone companies, mines, and railways that were once  "nationalized"  have  been  rapidly  privatized  throughout  the  world, you  will  soon  see  the  ultimate  form  of  privatization--the  sweeping denationalization of the individual. The Sovereign Individual of the new millennium will no longer be an asset of the state, a de facto item on the treasury's  balance  sheet.  After  the  transition  of  the  year  2000, denationalized citizens will no longer be citizens at all, but customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  commercialization  of  sovereignty  will  make  the  terms  and conditions  of  citizenship  in  the  nationstate  as  dated  as  chivalric  oaths seemed after the collapse of feudalism. Instead of relating to a powerful state as citizens to be taxed, the Sovereign Individuals of the twenty-first century  will  be  customers  of  governments.  These  governments  wilt  be organized along different principles than those which the world has come to expect over the past several centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  new  moral  vocabulary  will  be  required  to  describe  the  relations  of Sovereign  Individuals  with  one  another  and  what  remains  of government.  We  suspect  that  as  the  terms  of  these  new  relations  come into focus, they will offend many people who came of age as "citizens" </p>

<p class="calibre1">of  twentiethcentury  nationstates.  The  end  of  nations  and  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"denationalization  of  the  individual"  will  deflate  some  warmly  held notions, such as "equal protection under the law" that presuppose power relations that are soon to be obsolete. </p>

<p class="calibre1">18</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-20"></a>Just as attempts to preserve the power of knights in armor were doomed to  fail  in  the  face  of  gunpowder  weapons,  so  the  modem  notions  of nationalism  and  citizenship  are  destined  to  be  short-circuited  by microtechnology.  Indeed,  they  will  eventually  become  comic  in  much the  way  that  the  sacred  principles  of  fifteenth-century  feudalism  fell  to ridicule  in  the  sixteenth  century.  The  cherished  civic  notions  of  the twentieth  century  will  be  comic  anachronisms  to  new  generations  after the transformation of the year 2000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Don Quixote of the twenty-first century will not be a knight-errant struggling to revive the glories of feudalism but a bureaucrat in a brown suit, a tax collector yearning for a citizen to audit. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-21"></a><b class="calibre4">REVIVING LAWS OF THE MARCH</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  seldom  think  of  governments  as  competitive  entities,  except  in  the broadest sense, so the modern intuition about the range and possibilities of sovereignty has atrophied. In the past, when the power equation made more difficult for groups to assert a stable monopoly of coercion, power was  frequently  fragmented,  jurisdictions  overlapped,  and  entities  of many  different  kinds  exercised  one  or  more  of  the  attributes  of sovereignty.  Not  infrequently,  the  nominal  overlord  actually  enjoyed scant  power  on  the  ground.  Governments  weaker  than  the  nationstates are  now  faced  with  sustained  competition  in  their  ability  to  impose  a monopoly of coercion over a local territory. This 12</p>

<p class="calibre1">competition  gave  rise  to  adaptations  in  controlling  violence  and attracting allegiance that will soon be new again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When the reach of lords and kings was weak, and the claims of one or more groups overlapped at a frontier, it frequently happened that neither could  decisively  dominate  the  other.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  there  were numerous frontier or "march" </p>

<p class="calibre1">regions  where  sovereignties  blended  together.  These  violent  frontiers persisted  for  decades  or  even  centuries  in  the  border  areas  of  Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  were  marches  between  areas  of  Celtic  and  English  control  in Ireland;  between  Wales  and  England,  Scotland  and  England,  Italy  and France,  France  and  Spain,  Germany  and  the  Slav  frontiers  of  Central Europe  and  between  the  Christian  kingdoms  of  Spain  and  the  Islamic kingdom of Granada. Such march regions developed distinct institutional and  legal  forms  of  a  kind  that  we  are  likely  to  see  again  in  the  next millennium. Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, residents  of  march  region  seldom  paid  tax.  What  is  more,  they  usually had a choice in deciding who's laws they were to obey, a choice that was exercised  through  such  legal  concepts  as  "avowal"  and  "distraint"  that have  now  all  but  vanished.  We  expect  such  concepts  to  become  a prominent feature of the law of Information Societies. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Transcending Nationality</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">20</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-22"></a>Before the nationstate, it was difficult to enumerate precisely the number of  sovereignties  that  existed  in  the  world  because  they  overlapped  in complex ways and many varied forms of organization exercised power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  do  so  again.  The  dividing  lines  between  territories  tended  to become  clearly  demarcated  and  fixed  as  borders  in  the  nationstate system. They will become hazy again in the Information Age. In the new millennium, sovereignty will be fragmented once more. New entities will emerge exercising some but not all of the characteristics we have come to associate with governments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some of these new entities, like the Knights Templar and other religious military orders of the Middle Ages, may control considerable wealth and military  power  without  controlling  any  fixed  territory.  They  will  be organized  on  principles  that  bear  no  relation  to  nationality  at  all. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Members and leaders of religious corporations that exercised sovereign authority in parts of Europe in the Middle Ages in no sense derived their authority from national identity. They were of all ethnic backgrounds and professed  to  owe  their  allegiance  to  God,  and  not  to  any  affinities  that members of a nationality are supposed to share in common. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Merchant Republics of Cyberspace</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">You  will  also  see  the  reemergence  of  associations  of  merchants  and wealthy  individuals  with  semisovereign  powers,  like  the  Hanse (confederation  of  merchants)  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The  Hanse  that operated  in  the  French  and  Flemish  fairs  grew  to  encompass  the merchants of sixty cities.7 The "Hanseatie League," as it is redundantly 13</p>

<p class="calibre1">known in English (the literal translation is "Leaguely League"), was an organization  of  Germanic  merchant  guilds  that  provided  protection  to members and negotiated trade treaties. It came to exercise semisovereign powers in a number of Northern European and Baltic cities. Such entities will  reemerge  in  place  of  the  dying  nationstate  in  the  new  millennium, providing protection and helping to enforce contracts in an unsafe world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, the future is likely to confound the expectations of those who have  absorbed  the  civic  myths  of  twentiethcentury  industrial  society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">21</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-23"></a>Among them are the illusions of social democracy that once thrilled and motivated the most gifted minds. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  presuppose  that  societies  evolve  in  whatever  way  governments wish  them  to;  preferably  in  response  to  opinion  polls  and  scrupulously counted votes. This was never as true as it seemed fifty years ago. Now it is  an  anachronism,  as  much  an  artifact  of  industrialism  as  a  rusting smokestack.  The  civic  myths  reflect  not  only  a  mindset  that  sees society's  problems  as  susceptible  to  engineering  solutions;  they  also reflect  a  false  confidence  that  resources  and  individuals  will  remain  as vulnerable to political compulsion in the future as they have been in the twentieth  century.  We  doubt  it.  Market  forces,  not  political  majorities, will  compel  societies  to  reconfigure  themselves  in  ways  that  public opinion  will  neither  comprehend  nor  welcome.  As  they  do,  the  naive view  that  history  is  what  people  wish  it  to  be  will  prove  wildly misleading. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  will  therefore  be  crucial  that  you  see  the  world  anew.  That  means looking  from  the  outside  in  to  reanalyze  much  that  you  have  probably taken for granted. This will enable you to come to a new understanding. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  fail  to  transcend  conventional  thinking  at  a  time  when conventional thinking is losing touch with reality, then you will be more likely  to  fall  prey  to  an  epidemic  of  disorientation  that  lies  ahead. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Seeing Anew</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  prepare  yourself  for  the  world  that  is  coming  you  must  understand why it will be different from what most experts tell you. That involves looking closely at the hidden causes of change. We have attempted to do this  with  an  unorthodox  analysis  we  call  the  study  of  megapolitics.  In two previous volumes,  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Great</i> <i class="calibre3">Reckoning</i>, we argued that the most important causes of change are not to be found in political manifestos or in the pronouncements of dead economists, but in the  hidden  factors  that  alter  the  boundaries  where  power  is  exercised. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Often, subtle changes in climate, topography, microbes, and technology alter the logic of violence. They transform the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notice that our approach to understanding how the world changes is very different from that of most forecasters. We are not experts in anything, in the sense that we 14</p>

<p class="calibre1">pretend  to  know  a  great  deal  more  about  certain  "subjects"  than  those who  have  spent  their  entire  careers  cultivating  highly  specialized knowledge.  To  the  contrary,  we  look  from  the  outside  in.  We  are knowledgeable   <i class="calibre3">around</i>  the  subjects  about  which  we  make  forecasts. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most  of  all,  this  involves  seeing  where  the  boundaries  of  necessity  are drawn. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  they  change,  society  necessarily  changes,  no  matter  what  people may wish to the contrary. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  our  view,  the  key  to  understanding  how  societies  evolve  is  to understand  factors  that  determine  the  costs  and  rewards  of  employing violence, Every human society, from the hunting band to the empire, has been  informed  by  the  interactions  of  megapolitical  factors  that  set  the prevailing version of the "laws of nature." Life is always and everywhere complex.  The  lamb  and  the  lion  keep  a  delicate  balance,  interacting  at the margin. If lions were suddenly more swift, they would catch prey that now  escape.  If  lambs  suddenly  grew  wings,  lions  would  starve.  The 23</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-25"></a>capacity to utilize and defend against violence is the crucial variable that alters life at the margin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  put  violence  at  the  center  of  our  theory  of  megapolitics  for  good reason.  The  control  of  violence  is  the  most  important  dilemma  every society faces. As we wrote in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>: The  reason  that  people  resort  to  violence  is  that  it  often  pays.  In  some ways, the simplest thing a man can do if he wants money is to take it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That is no less true for an army of men seizing an oil field than it is for a single  thug  taking  a  wallet.  Power,  as  William  Playfair  wrote,  "has always sought the readiest road to wealth, by attacking those who were in possession of it." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The challenge to prosperity is precisely that predatory violence does pay well  in  some  circumstances.  War  does  change  things.  It  changes  the rules. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It changes the distribution of assets and income. It even determines who lives  and  who  dies.  It  is  precisely  the  fact  that  violence  does  pay  that makes it hard to control. 9</p>

<p class="calibre1">Thinking in these terms has helped us foresee a number of developments that  better-informed  experts  insisted  could  never  happen.  For  example, <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i>, published in early 1987, was our attempt to survey the first stages of the great megapolitical revolution now under way. We argued  then  that  technological  change  was  destabilizing  the  power equation  in  the  world.  Among  our  principal  points:  •  We  said  that American predominance was in decline, which would lead to economic imbalances  and  distress,  including  another  1929-style  stock  market crash. Experts were all but unanimous in denying that such a thing could happen.  Yet  within  six  months,  in  October  1987,  would  markets  were convulsed by the most violentsell-off of the century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We told readers to expect the collapse of Communism. Again, experts laughed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  1989  brought  the  events  that  "no  one  could  have  predicted."  The Berlin  Wall  fell,  as  revvolutions  swept  away  Communist  regimes  from 24</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>the Baltic to Bucharest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  We  explained  why  the  multiethnic  empire  that  the  Bolshevik nomenklatura inherited form the tsars would "inevitably crack apart." At the end of December 1991, the 15</p>

<p class="calibre1">hammer-and-cycle banner was lowered over the Kremlin for the last time as the Soviet Union ceased to exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• During the height of the Reagan arms buildup, we argued that the world stood  at  the  threshold  of  sweeping  disarmament.  This,  too,  was considered  unlikely,  if  not  preposterous.  Yet  the  following  seven  years brought the most sweeping disarmament since the close of World War I. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• At a time when experts in North America and Europe were pointing to Japan  for  support  of  the  view  that  governments  can  successfully  rig markets,  we  said  otherwise.  We  forecast  that  the  Japanese  financial assets boom would end in a bust. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Japanese stock market crashed, losing almost half its value. We continue to believe that its ultimate low could match or exceed the 89 percent loss that Wall Street suffered at the bottom after 1929. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• At a point when almost everyone, from the middle-class family to the world's  largest  real  estate  investors,  appeared  to  believe  that  property markets  could  only  rise  and  not  fall,  we  warned  that  a  real  estate  bust was in the offing. Within four years, real estate investors throughout the world lost more than $1 trillion as property values dropped. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• Long before it was obvious to the experts, we explained in  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the</i> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i>  that  the  income  of  blue-collar  workers  had  decreased  and  was destined  to  continue  falling  on  a  long-term  basis.  As  we  write  today, almost a decade later, it has at last begun to dawn on a sleepy world that this is true. Average hourly wages in the United States have fallen below those  achieved  in  the  second  Eisenhower  administration.  In  1993, average  annualized  hourly  wages  in  constant  dollars  were  $18,808.  In 1957,  when  Eisenhower  was  sworn  in  for  his  second  term,  U.S, annualized average hourly wages were $18,903. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-27"></a>While the main themes of  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> have proven remarkably accurate  with  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  only  a  few  years  ago  they  were considered rank nonsense by the guardians of conventional thinking. A reviewer  in  Newsweek  in  1987  reflected  the  closed  mental  climate  of late industrial society when he dismissed our analysis as "an unthinking attack on reason." </p>

<p class="calibre1">You might imagine that Newsweek and similar publications would have recognized with the passage of time that our line of analysis had revealed something useful about the way the world was changing. Not a bit, The first  edition  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Great</i> <i class="calibre3">Reckoning</i>  was  greeted  with  the  same sniggering  hostility  that  welcomed   <i class="calibre3">Blood  in  the</i> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i>.  No  less  an authority  than  the  Wall  Street  Journal  categorically  dismissed  our analysis as the nattering of "your dopey aunt." </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  chuckling  aside,  the  themes  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>  proved  less ludicrous than the guardians of orthodoxy pretended. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We extended our forecast of the death of the Soviet Union, exploring why  Russia  and  the  other  former  Soviet  republics  faced  a  future  of growing civil disorder4</p>

<p class="calibre1">hyperinflation, and falling living standards. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  We  explained  why  the  1  990s  would  be  a  decade  of  downsizing, including  for  the  first  time  a  worldwide  downsizing  of  governments  as well as business entities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">16</p>

<p class="calibre1">• We also forecast that there would be a major redefinition of terms of income redistribution, with sharp cutbacks in the level of benefits. Hints of  fiscal  crisis  appeared  from  Canada  to  Sweden,  and  American politicians began to talk of "ending welfare as we know it." </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We anticipated and explained why the "new world order" would prove to  be  a  "new  world  disorder."  Well  before  the  atrocities  in  Bosnia engrossed the headlines, we warned that Yugoslavia would collapse into civil war. </p>

<p class="calibre1">26</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>•  Before  Somalia  slid  into  anarchy,  we  explained  why  the  pending collapse of governments in Africa would lead some countries there to be effectively placed into receivership. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We forecast and explained why militant Islam would displace Marxism as the principal ideology of confrontation with the West. Years before the Oklahoma bombing and the attempt to blow up the World Trade Center, we explained why the United States faced an upsurge in terrorism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  Before  the  headlines  that  told  of  the  rioting  that  swept  Los  Angeles, Toronto,  and  other  cities,  we  explained  why  the  emergence  of  criminal subcultures among urban minorities was setting the stage for widespread criminal violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>  also  spelled  out  a  number  of  controversial  theses that  have  not  yet  been  confirmed,  or  have  not  reached  the  level  of development that we forecast: • We said that the Japanese stock market would  follow  Wall  Street's  path  after  1929,  and  that  this  would  lead  to credit collapse and depression. Although unemployment rates in Spain, Finland,  and  a  few  other  countries  exceeded  those  of  the  1930s,  and  a number of countries, including Japan, did experience local depressions, there  has  not  yet  been  a  systemic  credit  collapse  of  the  kind  that imploded economies worldwide in the 1930s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We argued that the breakdown of the command-and-control system in the  former  Soviet  Union  would  lead  to  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons into the hands of ministates, terrorists, and criminal gangs. To the world's good fortune, this has not come to pass, at least not to the degree that we feared. Press reports indicate that Iran purchased several tactical nuclear weapons  on  the  black  market,  and  German  authorities  foiled  several attempts  to  sell  nuclear  materials.  But  there  has  been  no  announced deployment  or  use  of  nuclear  weapons  from  the  arsenals  of  the  former Soviet Union. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• We explained why the "War on Drugs" was a recipe for subverting the police  and  judicial  systems  of  countries  where  drug  use  is  widespread, particularly the United States. With tens of billions of dollars in hidden monopoly  profits  piling  up  each  year,  drug  dealers  have  the  means  as well as the incentive to corrupt even apparently stable countries. While 27</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-29"></a>the  world  media  have  carried  occasional  stories  hinting  at  high-level penetration of the U.S. political system by drug money, the full story has not yet been told. </p>

<p class="calibre1">17</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Looking Where Others Don't</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  points  where  our  forecasts  were  mistaken  or  seem mistaken  in  light  of  what  is  now  known,  the  record  stands  to  scrutiny. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Much of what is likely to figure in future economic histories of the 1990s was forecast or anticipated and explained in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>. Many of our forecasts were not simple extrapolations or extensions of trends, but forecasts of major departures from what has been considered normal since  World  War  II.  We  warned  that  the  1990s  would  be  dramatically different  from  the  previous  five  decades.  Reading  the  news  of  1991</p>

<p class="calibre1">through  1995,  we  see  that  the  themes  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>  were borne out almost daily. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  see  these  developments  not  as  examples  of  isolated  difficulties, trouble here, trouble there, but as shocks and tremors that run along the same  fault  line.  The  old  order  is  being  toppled  by  a  megapolitical earthquake that will revolutionize institutions and alter the way thinking people see the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In spite of the central role of violence in determining the way the world works,  it  attracts  surprisingly  little  serious  attention.  Most  political analysts and economists write as if violence were a minor irritant, like a fly buzzing around a cake, and not the chef who baked it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Another Megapolitical Pioneer</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In fact, there has been so little clear thinking about the role of violence in history that a bibliography of megapolitical analysis could be written on a single sheet of paper. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, we drew upon and elaborated arguments of an almost  entirely  forgotten  classic  of  megapolitical  analysis,  William Playfair's  <i class="calibre3">An Enquiry into the</i> <i class="calibre3">Permanent Causes of the Decline and Fall</i> <i class="calibre3">of  Powerful  and  Wealthy  Nations</i>,  published  in  1805.  Were  one  of  our 28</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-30"></a>departure points is the work of Frederic C. Lane. Lane was a medieval historian who wrote several penetrating essays on the role of violence in history during the1940s and 1950s. Perhaps the most comprehensive of these  was  "Economic  Consequences  of  Organized  Violence,"  which appeared in the  <i class="calibre3">Journal of Economic</i> <i class="calibre3">History</i> in 1958. Few people other than  professional  economists  and  historians  have  read  it,  and  most  of them  seem  not  to  have  recognized  its  significance.  Like  Playfair,  Lane wrote for an audience that did not yet exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Insights for the Information Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane published his work on violence and the economic meaning of war well  before  the  advent  of  the  Information  Age.  He  certainly  was  not writing  in  anticipation  of  microprocessing  or  the  other  technological revolutions  now  unfolding.  Yet  his  insights  into  violence  established  a framework  for  understanding  how  society  will  be  reconfigured  in  the Information Revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">18</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  window  Lane  opened  into  the  future  was  one  through  which  he peered  into  the  past.  He  was  a  medieval  historian,  and  particularly  a historian of a trading City, Venice, whose fortunes surged and sagged in a violent world. In thinking about how Venice rose and fell, his attention was attracted to issues that can help you understand the future. He saw the fact that how violence is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining "what uses are made of scarce resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We believe that Lane's analyses of the competitive uses of violence has much to tell us about how life is likely to change in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  don't  expect  most  people  to  notice,  much  less  follow,  so unfashionably abstract an argument. While the attention of the world is riveted on dishonest debates and wayward personalities, the meanderings of  megapolitics  continue  almost  unnoted.  The  average  North  American has probably lavished one hundred times more attention on 0. J. Simpson than he has on the new microtechnologies that are poised to antiquate his job  and  subvert  the  political  system  he  depends  on  for  unemployment compensation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">29</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-31"></a><b class="calibre4">THE VANITY OF WISHES</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  tendency  to  overlook  what  is  fundamentally  important  is  not confined  solely  to  the  couch  dweller  watching  television.  Conventional thinkers  of  all  shapes  and  sizes  observe  one  of  the  pretenses  of  the nationstate-that  the  views  people  hold  determine  the  way  the  world changes.  Apparently  sophisticated  analysts  lapse  into  explanations  and forecasts  that  interpret  major  historical  developments  as  if  they  were determined  in  a  wishful  way.  A  striking  example  of  this  type  of reasoning appeared on the editorial page of the New York Times just as we were writing "Goodbye, NationState, Hello. </p>

<p class="calibre1">..What?," by Nicholas Colchester.11 Not only was the topic, the death of the nationstate, the very topic we are addressing, but its author presents himself as an excellent marker to illustrate how far removed our way of thinking  is  from  the  norm.  Colehester  is  no  simpleton.  He  wrote  as editorial  director  of  the   <i class="calibre3">Economist  </i> Intelligence  Unit.  If  anyone  should form a realistic view of the world it should be he. Yet his article clearly indicates in several places that "the coming of international government</p>

<p class="calibre1">"is" now logically unstoppable." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Why?  Because  the  nationstate  is  faltering  and  can  no  longer  control economic forces. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In our view, this assumption verges on the absurd. To suppose that some specific new form of governance will emerge simply because another has failed  is  a  fallacy.  By  that  reasoning,  Haiti  and  Zaire  would  long  ago have  had  better  government  simply  because  what  they  had  was  so luminously inadequate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Colchester's  point  of  view;  widely  shared  among  the  few  who  think about such things in North America and Europe, utterly fails to take into account  the  larger  megapolitical  forces  that  determine  what  types  of political systems are actually viable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That is the focus of this book. When the technologies that arc shaping the new millennium are considered, it is far more likely that we will see not 30</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-32"></a>one  world  government,  but  microgovemment,  or  oven  conditions approaching anarchy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">19</p>

<p class="calibre1">For every serious analysis of the role of violence in determining the rules by  which  everyone  operates,  dozens  of  books  have  been  written  about the  intricacies  of  wheat  subsidies,  and  hundreds  more  about  arcane aspects of monetary policy. Much of this shortfall in thinking about the crucial  issues  that  actually  determine  the  course  of  history  probably reflects  the  relative  stability  of  the  power  configuration  over  the  past several  centuries.  The  bird  that  falls  asleep  on  the  back  of  a hippopotamus  does  not  think  about  losing  its  perch  until  the  hippo actually moves. Dreams, myths, and fantasies play a much larger role in informing the supposed social sciences than we commonly think. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is particularly evident in the abundant literature of economic justice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Millions of words have been uttered and written about economic justice and injustice for each page devoted to careful analysis of how violence shapes  society,  and  thus  sets  the  boundaries  within  which  economies must  function.  Yet  formulations  of  economic  justice  in  the  modern context  presuppose  that  society  is  dominated  by  an  instrument  of compulsion so powerful that it can take away and redistribute life's good things. Such power has existed for only a few generations of the modern period. Now it is fading away. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Big Brother on Social Security</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Industrial technology gave governments greater instruments of control in the twentieth century than ever before. For a time, it seemed inevitable that  governments  would  become  so  effective  at  monopolizing  violence as  to  leave  little  room  for  individual  autonomy.  Nobody  at  midcentury was looking forward to the triumph of the Sovereign Individual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some  of  the  shrewdest  observers  of  the  mid-twentieth  century  became convinced on the evidence of the day that the tendency of the nationstate to centralize power would lead to totalitarian domination over all aspects of life. In George Orwell's  <i class="calibre3">1984 </i>(1949),  Big  Brother  was  watching  the 31</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-33"></a>individual  vainly  struggle  to  maintain  a  margin  of  autonomy  and  self-respect. It appeared to be a losing cause. Friedrich von Hayek's  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Road</i> <i class="calibre3">to Serfdom</i>  (1944)  took  a  more  scholarly  view  in  arguing  that  freedom was being lost to a new form of economic control that left the state as the master of everything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These works were written before the advent of microprocessing, which has incubated a whole range of technologies that enhance the capacity of small  groups  and  even  individuals  to  function  independently  of  central authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As shrewd as observers like Hayek and Orwell were, they were unduly pessimistic. History has unfolded its surprises. Totalitarian Communism barely outlasted the year 1984. A new form of serfdom may yet emerge in  the  next  millennium  if  governments  succeed  in  suppressing  the liberating  aspects  of  microtechnology.  But  it  is  far  more  likely  that  we will  see  unprecedented  opportunity  and  autonomy  for  the  individual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What our parents worried about may prove to be no problem at all. What they took for granted as fixed and permanent features of social life now seem  destined  to  disappear.  Wherever  necessity  sets  boundaries  to human choice, we adjust, and reorganize our lives accordingly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">20</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Hazards of Forecasting</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">No  doubt  we  put  our  small  measure  of  dignity  at  risk  in  attempting  to foresee and explain profound changes in the organization of life and the culture that binds it together. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most forecasts are doomed to make silly reading in the fullness of time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And  the  more  dramatic  the  change  they  envision,  the  more embarrassingly wrong they tend to be. The world doesn't end. The ozone doesn't  vanish.  The  coming  Ice  Age  dissolves  into  global  warming. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  all  the  alarms  to  the  contrary,  there  is  still  oil  in  the tank. Mr. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Antrobus,  the  everyman  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Skin  of  Our  Teeth</i>,  avoids  freezing, survives  wars  and  threatened  economic  calamities,  and  grows  old 32</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-34"></a>ignoring the studied alarms of experts. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most  attempts  to  "unveil"  the  future  soon  turn  out  to  be  comic.  Even where self-interest provides a strong incentive to clear thinking, forward vision is often myopic. In 1903, the Mercedes company said that "there would never be as many as 1 million automobiles worldwide. The reason was that it was implausible that as many as 1</p>

<p class="calibre1">million artisans worldwide would be trainable as chauffeurs." 12</p>

<p class="calibre1">Recognizing this should stop our mouths. It doesn't. We are not afraid to stand  in  line  for  a  due  share  of  ridicule.  If  we  mistake  matters  greatly, future  generations  may  laugh  as  heartily  as  they  please,  presuming anyone  remembers  what  we  said.  To  dare  a  thought  is  to  risk  being wrong.  We  are  hardly  so  stiff  and  useless  that  we  are  afraid  to  err.  Far from it. We would rather venture thoughts that might prove useful to you than suppress them out of apprehension that they might prove overblown or embarrassing in retrospect. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Arthur  C.  Clarke  shrewdly  noted,  the  two  overriding  reasons  why attempts  to  anticipate  the  future  usually  fall  flat  are  "Failure  of  Nerve and Failure of Imagination." ' </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of the two, he wrote, "Failure of Nerve seems to be the more common; it occurs  when   <i class="calibre3">even  given  all  of  the  relevant  facts</i>  the  would-be  prophet cannot  see  that  they  point  to  an  inescapable  conclusion,  Some  of  these failures are so ludicrous as to be almost unbelievable." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Where  our  exploration  of  the  Information  Revolution  falls  short,  as  it inevitably will, the cause will be due more to a lack of imagination than to a lack of nerve. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Forecasting  the  future  has  always  been  a  bold  enterprise,  one  which properly excites skepticism. Perhaps time will prove that our deductions are  wildly  off  the  mark.  Unlike  Nostradamus,  we  do  not  pretend  to  be prophetic personalities. We do not foretell the future by stirring a wand in a bowl of water or by casting horoscopes. Nor do we write in cryptic verse. Our purpose is to provide you with a sober, detached analysis of issues that could prove to be of great importance to you. </p>

<p class="calibre1">33</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-35"></a>We  feel  an  obligation  to  set  out  our  views,  even  where  they  seem heretical,  precisely  because  they  may  not  otherwise  be  heard.  In  the closed mental atmosphere of late industrial society, ideas do not traffic as freely as they should through the established media. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  book  is  written  in  a  constructive  spirit.  It  is  the  third  we  have written together, analyzing various stages of the great change now under way. Like  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the</i> 21</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, it is a thought exercise. It explores the death  of  industrial  society  and  its  reconfiguration  in  new  forms.  We expect to see amazing paradoxes in the years to come. On the one hand, you  will  witness  the  realization  of  a  new  form  of  freedom,  with  the emergence of the Sovereign Individual. You can expect to see almost the complete liberation of productivity. At the same time, we expect to see the death of the modern nationstate. Many of the assurances of equality that  Western  people  have  grown  to  take  for  granted  in  the  twentieth century are destined to die with it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  expect  that  representative  democracy  as  it  is  now  known  will  fade away,  to  be  replaced  by  the  new  democracy  of  choice  in  the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct, the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  are  confident  that  our  argument  will  be  easy  to  follow, notwithstanding  the  fact  that  it  leads  through  some  territory  that  is  the intellectual equivalent of the backwoods and bad neighborhoods. If our meaning is not entirely intelligible in places, that is not because we are being cute, or using the time-honored equivocation of those who pretend to  foretell  the  future  by  making  cryptic  pronouncements.  We  are  not equivocators. If our arguments are unclear, it is because we have failed the  task  of  writing  in  a  way  that  makes  compelling  ideas  accessible. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike many forecasters, we want you to understand and even duplicate our line of thinking. It is based not upon psychic reveries or the gyrations of planets, but upon old-fashioned, ugly logic. For quite logical reasons, we believe that microprocessing will inevitably subvert and destroy the nationstate, creating new forms of social organization in the process. It is 34</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-36"></a>both necessary and possible for you to foresee at least some details of the new way of life that may be here sooner than you think. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Ironies of a Future Foretold</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">For  centuries,  the  end  of  this  millennium  has  been  seen  as  a  pregnant moment in history. More than 850 years ago, St. Malachy fixed 2000 as the  date  of  the  Last  Judgment.  American  psychic  Edgar  Cayce  said  in 1934  that  the  earth  would  shift  on  its  axis  in  the  year  2000,  causing California  to  split  in  two  and  inundating  New  York  City  and  Japan.  A Japanese  rocket  scientist,  Hideo  Itokawa,  announced  in  1980  that  the alignment of the planets in a "Grand Cross" on August 18, 1999, would cause  widespread  environmental  devastation,  leading  to  the  end  of human life on earth.' 15</p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  visions  of  apocalypse  make  a  plump  target  for  ridicule,  Alter  all, the  year  2000,  while  an  imposing  round  number,  is  only  an  arbitrary artifact of the Christian calendar as adopted in the West. Other calendars and  dating  systems  calculate  centuries  and  millennia  from  different starting  points.  By  the  reckoning  of  the  Islamic  calendar,  for  example, A.D. 2000 will be the year 1378. As ordinary-sounding as a year can be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">According to the Chinese calendar, which repeats itself every sixty years, A.D. 2000 is just another year of the dragon. It is part of a continuous cycle that extends millennia into the past. </p>

<p class="calibre1">22</p>

<p class="calibre1">Professor  Itokawa  notwithstanding,  premonitions  about  the  new millennium seem closely tied to the Christian faith, and the predominant Western imagination of time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  are  prophecies,  not  astrophysics.  Most  are  dreams,  reveries,  and visions,  or  numerical  interpretations  of  visions,  like  Newton's  gloss  on the prophecies of Daniel. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  intuitive  leaps  begin  with  a  perspective  that  takes  the  birth  of Christ  to  be  the  central  fact  of  history.  They  are  compounded  by  the psychological  power  of  large  round  numbers,  which  every  trader  will recognize as having an arresting quality. The two thousandth year of our 35</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-37"></a>epoch  cannot  help  but  become  a  focus  for  the  imagination  of  intuitive people. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  critic  could  easily  make  these  premonitions  seem  silly,  without  even addressing  the  ambiguous  and  debatable  theological  notions  of  the Apocalypse  and  the  Last  Judgment  that  give  these  visions  so  much  of their power Even within the Christian framework, the year 2000 can only seem  the  likely  inflection  point  for  the  next  stage  of  history  if  one overlooks  errors  of  arithmetic.  In  strict  logic,  the  next  millennium  will not begin until 2001. The year 2000 will be only the two thousandth year since Christ's birth. Or it would be had Christ been born in the first year of the Christian era. He was not. In 533, when Christ's birth replaced the founding date of Rome as the basis for calculating years according to the Western  calendar,  the  monks  who  introduced  the  new  convention miscalculated Christ's birth. It is now accepted that he was born in 4 B.C. </p>

<p class="calibre1">On that basis, a full two thousand years since his birth will be completed sometime in 1997. Hence Carl Jung's apparently odd launch date for the start of a New Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Giggle  if  you  will,  but  we  do  not  despise  or  dismiss  intuitive understandings of history. Although our argument is grounded in logic, not  in  revenues,  we  are  awed  by  the  prophetic  power  of  human consciousness.  Time  after  time,  it  redeems  the  visions  of  madmen, psychics,  and  saints.  So  it  may  be  with  the  transformation  of  the  year 2000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The date that has long been fixed in the imagination of the West looks to be  the  inflection  point  that  at  least  half  confirms  that  history  has  a destiny.  We  cannot  explain  why  this  should  be,  but  nonetheless  we  are convinced that it is so. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Our  intuition  is  that  history  has  a  destiny,  and  that  free  will  and determinism  are  two  versions  of  the  same  phenomenon.  The  human interactions that form history behave as though they were informed by a kind  of  destiny.  lust  as  an  electron  plasma,  a  dense  gas  of  electrons, behaves  as  a  complex  system,  so  do  human  beings.  The  freedom  of individual  movement  by  the  electrons  turns  out  to  be  compatible  with highly organized collective behavior. As David Ohm said of an electron 36</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-38"></a>plasma, human history is "a highly organized system which behaves as a whole." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Understanding  the  way  the  world  works  means  developing  a  realistic intuition of the way that human society obeys the mathematics of natural processes. Reality is nonlinear But most people's expectations are not. To understand  the  dynamics  of  change,  you  have  to  recognize  that  human society, like other complex systems in nature, is characterized by cycles and  discontinuities.  That  means  certain  features  of  history  have  a tendency  to  repeat  themselves,  and  the  most  important  changes,  when they occur, may be abrupt rather than gradual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Among the cycles that permeate human life, a mysterious five-hundred-year cycle appears to mark major turning points in the history of Western civilization. As the year 23</p>

<p class="calibre1">2000 approaches, we arc haunted by the strange fact that the final decade of  each  century  divisible  by  five  has  marked  a  profound  transition  in Western civilization, a pattern of death and rebirth that marks new phases of social organization in much the way that death and birth delineate the cycle of human generations. This has been true since at least 500 B.C., when  Greek  democracy  emerged  with  the  constitutional  reforms  of Cleisthenes  in  508  B.C.  The  following  five  centuries  were  a  period  of growth  and  intensification  of  the  ancient  economy,  culminating  in  the birth of Christ in 4 B.C. This was also the time of the greatest prosperity of  the  ancient  economy,  when  interest  rates  reached  their  lowest  level prior to the modern period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  next  five  centuries  saw  a  gradual  winding  down  of  prosperity, leading  to  the  collapse  of  the  Roman  Empire  late  in  the  fifth  century A.D. William Playfair's summary is worth repeating: "When Rome was at  its  highest  pitch  of  greatness.  ...  will  be  seen  to  be  at  the  birth  of Christ, that is, during the reign of Augustus, and by the same means it will be found declining gradually till the year 490." 16 It was then that the  last  legions  dissolved,  and  the  Western  world  sank  into  the  Dark Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">During the following five centuries, the economy withered, long-distance trade  ground  to  a  halt,  cities  were  depopulated,  money  vanished  from 37</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-39"></a>circulation,  and  art  and  literacy  almost  disappeared.  The  disappearance of effective law with the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West led to  the  emergence  of  more  primitive  arrangements  for  settling  disputes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The blood feud began to be significant at the end of the fifth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  first  recorded  incident  of  trial  by  ordeal  occurred  precisely  in  the year 500. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Once again, a thousand years ago, the final decade of the tenth century witnessed  another  "tremendous  upheaval  in  social  and  economic systems."  Perhaps  the  least  known  of  these  transitions,  the  feudal revolution,  began  at  a  time  of  utter  economic  and  political  turmoil.  In <i class="calibre3">The Transformation of the Year One Thousand</i>, Guy Bois, a professor of medieval history at the University of Paris, claims that this rupture at the end of the tenth century involved the complete collapse of the remnants of ancient institutions, and the emergence of something new out of the anarchy feudalism.' 17 In the words of Raoul Glaber, "It was said that the whole  world,  with  one  accord,  shook  off  the  tatters  of  antiquity."  'The new  system  that  suddenly  emerged  accommodated  the  slow  revival  of economic  growth.  The  five  centuries  now  known  as  the  Middle  Ages saw  a  rebirth  of  money  and  international  trade,  along  with  the rediscovery of arithmetic, literacy and time awareness. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Then, in the final decade of the fifteenth century, there was yet another turning  point.  It  was  then  that  Europe  emerged  from  the  demographic deficit  caused  by  the  Black  Death  and  almost  immediately  began  to assert dominion over the rest of the globe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The "Gunpowder Revolution," the "Renaissance," and the "Reformation" </p>

<p class="calibre1">are names given to different aspects of this transition that ushered in the Modern Age. It was announced with a bang when Charles VIII invaded Italy  with  new  bronze  cannon.  It  involved  an  opening  to  the  world, epitomized by Columbus sailing to America in 1492. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  opening  to  the  New  World  launched  a  push  toward  the  most dramatic economic growth in the experience of humanity. It involved a transformation  of  physics  and  astronomy  that  led  to  the  creation  of modern  science.  And  its  ideas  were  disseminated  widely  with  the  new technology of the printing press. </p>

<p class="calibre1">38</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>24</p>

<p class="calibre1">Now  we  sit  at  the  threshold  of  another  millennial  transformation.  We expect it to utterly transform the world, in ways that this book is meant to explain. You would be perfectly within your rights to doubt this, since no cycle that repeats itself only twice in a millennium has demonstrated enough  iterations  to  be  statistically  significant.  Indeed,  even  much shorter  cycles  have  been  viewed  skeptically  by  economists  demanding more  statistically  satisfying  proof.  "Professor  Dennis  Robertson  once wrote  that  we  had  better  wait  a  few  centuries  before  being  sure"  about the existence of four-year and the eight-to ten-year trade cycles.' 19 By that standard, Professor Robertson would have to suspend judgment for about thirty thousand years to be sure that the five-hundred-year cycle is not a statistical fluke. We are less dogmatic, or more willing to recognize that the patterns of reality are more complex than the static-and linear-equilibrium models of most economists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  the  coming  of  the  year  2000  marks  more  than  another convenient  division  along  an  endless  continuum  of  time.  We  believe  it will be an inflection point between, the Old World and a New World to come.  The  Industrial  Age  is  rapidly  passing.  Its  technology  of  mass production  has  been  eclipsed  by  a  new  technology  of  miniaturization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With  the  new  information  technology  has  come  a  new  science  of nonlinear  dynamics,  one  whose  startling  conclusions  are  mere  strands that have yet to be woven together into a comprehensive worldview. We live  in  the  time  of  the  computer,  but  our  dreams  are  still  spun  on  the loom.  We  continue  to  live  by  the  metaphors  and  thoughts  of industrialism.  Our  politics  still  straddles  the  industrial  divide  between right and left, as mapped by thinkers like Adam Smith and Karl Marx, who died before almost everyone now living was born.* The industrial worldview, incorporating the operating principles of industrial science, is still the "commonsense ' intuition of educated opinion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  our  thesis  that  the  "common  sense"  of  the  Industrial  Age  will  no longer apply to many areas as the world is transformed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">More than eighty-five years after the day in 1911 when Oswald Spengler was seized with an intuition of a coming world war and "the decline of the West," we, too, see "a historical change of phase occurring. ... at the 39</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-41"></a>point preordained for it hundreds of years ago."20 Like Spengler, we see the impending death of Western civilization, and with it the collapse of the  world  order  that  has  predominated  these  past  five  centuries,  ever since  Columbus  sailed  west  to  open  contact  with  the  New  World.  Yet unlike Spengler we see the birth of a new stage in Western civilization in the coming millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE WANING OF THE MODERN WORLD</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  our  view,  you  are  witnessing  nothing  less  than  the  waning  of  the Modern Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It is a development driven by a ruthless but hidden logic. More than we commonly understand, more than CNN and the newspapers tell us, the next  millennium  will  no  longer  be  "modern."  We  say  this  not  to  imply that you face a savage or backward future, although that is possible, but to emphasize that the stage of history now opening will be qualitatively different from that into which you were born. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Something new is coming. Just as farming societies differed in kind from hunting-and-gathering  bands,  and  industrial  societies  differed  radically from feudal or yeoman agricultural systems, so the New World to come will mark a radical departure from anything seen before. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  millennium,  economic  and  political  life  will  no  longer  be organized on a gigantic scale under the domination of the nationstate as it  was  during  the  modern  centuries.  The  civilization  that  brought  you world war, the assembly line, social security, income tax, deodorant, and the toaster oven is dying. Deodorant and the toaster oven may survive. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The others won't. Like an ancient and once mighty man, the nationstate has a future numbered in years and days, and no longer in centuries and decades. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  have  already  lost  much  of  their  power  to  regulate  and compel. The collapse of Communism marked the end of a long cycle of five centuries during which magnitude of power overwhelmed efficiency in  the  organization  of  government.  It  was  a  time  when  the  returns  to violence were high and rising. They no longer are. A phase transition of world-historic dimensions has already begun. Indeed, the future Gibbon 42</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a>who chronicles the decline and fall of the once-Modern Age in the next millennium may declare that it had already ended by the time you read this book. Looking back, he may say, as we do, that it ended with the fall of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  1989.  Or  with  the  death  of  the  Soviet  Union  in 1991.  Either  date  could  come  to  stand  as  a  defining  event  in  the evolution of civilization, the end of what we now know as the Modern Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fourth stage of human development is coming, and perhaps its least predictable feature is the new name under which it will be known. Call it</p>

<p class="calibre1">"PostModern." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Call it the "Cyber Society" or the "Information Age." Or make up your own name. No one knows what conceptual glue will stick a nickname to the next phase of history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3 Huizinga, op. cit., p.7. </p>

<p class="calibre1">26</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  do  not  even  know  that  the  five-hundred-year  stretch  of  history  just ending  will  continue  to  be  thought  of  as  "modem."  If  future  historians know anything about word derivations, it will not be. A more descriptive title might be "The Age of the State" or "The Age of Violence." But such a name would fall outside the temporal spectrum that currently defines the  epochs  of  history.  "Modern,"  according  to  the   <i class="calibre3">0xford  English</i> <i class="calibre3">Dictionary</i>  means  pertaining  to  the  present  and  recent  times,  as distinguished from the remote past.... In historical use commonly applied (in contradiction to  <i class="calibre3">ancient</i> and  <i class="calibre3">medieval</i>) to the time subsequent to the MIDDLE AGES<a href="#calibre_link-1">."4</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Western  people  consciously  thought  of  themselves  as  "modern"  only when they came to understand that the medieval period was over. Before 1500, no one had ever thought of the feudal centuries as a middle" period in Western civilization. The reason is obvious upon reflection: before an age can reasonably be seen as sandwiched in the "middle" of two other historic epochs, it must have already come to an end. Those living during the  feudal  centuries  could  not  have  imagined  themselves  as  living  in  a halfway house between antiquity and modem civilization until it dawned 43</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-45"></a>on  them  not  just  that  the  medieval  period  was  over,  but  also  that medieval civilization differed dramatically from that of the Dark Ages or antiquit<a href="#calibre_link-1">y.5</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Human  cultures  have  blind  spots.  We  have  no  vocabulary  to  describe paradigm  changes  in  the  largest  boundaries  of  life,  especially  those happening around us. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding the many dramatic changes that have unfolded since the time of Moses, only a few heretics have bothered to think about how the transitions  from  one  phase  of  civilization  to  another  actually  unfold, How are they triggered? What do they have in common? What patterns can help you tell when they begin and know when they are over? When will  Great  Britain  or  the  United  States  come  to  an  end?  These  are questions  for  which  you  would  be  hard-pressed  to  find  conventional answers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Taboo on Foresight</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  see  "outside"  an  existing  system  is  like  being  a  stagehand  trying  to force a dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps  keep  the  system  functioning.  Every  social  order  incorporates among its key taboos the notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place. Implicitly, whatever system exists is the last or the only system  that  will  ever  exist.  Not  that  this  is  so  baldly  stated.  Few  who have ever read a history book would find such an assumption realistic if it  was  articulated.  Nonetheless,  that  is  the  convention  that  rules  the world.  Every  social  system,  however  strongly  or  weakly  it  clings  to power, pretends that its rules will never be superseded. They are the last word. Or perhaps the only word. Primitives assume that theirs is the only possible way of organizing life. More economically complicated systems that incorporate a sense of history usually place themselves at its apex. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the  House  of  Representatives  in  Washington,  the  powers-that-be  either imagine no history at all or place themselves at the pinnacle of history, in a  superior  position  compared  to  everyone  who  came  before,  and  the vanguard of anything to come. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is true for almost unavoidable reasons. The more apparent it is that a system is nearing an end, the more reluctant people will be to adhere to its laws. Any social organization will therefore tend to discourage or play down  analyses  that  anticipate  its  demise.  This  alone  helps  ensure  that history's great transitions are seldom spotted as they happen. If you know nothing else about the future, you can rest assured that dramatic changes will be neither welcomed nor advertised by conventional thinkers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  cannot  depend  upon  conventional  information  sources  to  give  you an  objective  and  timely  warning  about  how  the  world  is  changing  and why. If you wish to understand the great transition now under way, you have little choice but to figure it out for yourself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Beyond the Obvious</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  means  looking  beyond  the  obvious.  The  record  shows  that  even transitions  that  are  undeniably  real  in  retrospect  may  not  be acknowledged for decades or even centuries after they happen. Consider the  fall  of  Rome.  It  was  probably  the  most  important  historic development in the first millennium of the Christian era. Yet long after Rome's demise, the fiction that it survived was held out to public view, like Lenin's embalmed corpse. No one who depended upon the pretenses of officials for his understanding of the "news" would have learned that Rome had fallen until long after that information ceased to matter. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  reason  was  not  merely  the  inadequacy  of  communications  in  the ancient world. The outcome would have been much the same had CNN</p>

<p class="calibre1">miraculously been in business, running its videotape in September 476. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That is when the last Roman emperor in the West, Romulus Augustulus, was captured in Ravenna and forcibly retired to a villa in Campania on a 45</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-47"></a>pension. Even if Wolfe Blitzer had been there with minicams recording the news in 476, it is unlikely that he or anyone else would have dared to characterize those events as marking the end of the Roman Empire. That, of  course,  is  exactly  what  latter  historians  said  happened.  CNN  editors probably  would  not  have  approved  a  headline  story  saying  "Rome  fell this evening." The powers-that-be denied that Rome had fallen. Peddlers of  "news"  seldom  are  partisans  of  controversy  in  ways  that  would undermine their own profits. They may be partisan. They may even be outrageously so. But they seldom report conclusions that would convince subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and head for the hills. Which is why  few  would  have  reported  the  fall  of  Rome  even  if  it  had  been technologically  possible.  Experts  would  have  come  forth  to  say  that  it was ridiculous to speak of Rome falling. To have said otherwise would have  been  bad  for  business  and,  perhaps,  bad  for  the  health  of  those doing  the  reporting.  The  powers  in  late-fifth-century  Rome  were barbarians, and they denied that Rome had fallen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">28</p>

<p class="calibre1">But it was not merely a case of authorities' saying, "Don't report this or we  will  kill  you."  Part  of  the  problem  was  that  Rome  was  already  so degenerate  by  the  later  decades  of  the  fifth  century  that  its  "fall" </p>

<p class="calibre1">genuinely eluded the notice of most people who lived through it. In fact, it  was  a  generation  later  before  Count  Marcellinus  first  suggested  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"The  Western  Roman  Empire  perished  with  this  Augustulus<a href="#calibre_link-1">."6  Many</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">more  decades  passed,  perhaps  centuries,  before  there  was  a  common acknowledgment that the Roman Empire in the West no longer existed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Certainly Charlemagne believed that he was a legitimate Roman emperor in the year 800. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The point is not that Charlemagne and all who thought in conventional terms about the Roman Empire after 476 were fools. To the contrary. The characterization of social developments is frequently ambiguous. When the  power  of  predominant  institutions  is  brought  into  the  bargain  to reinforce  a  convenient  conclusion,  even  one  based  largely  on  pretense, only  someone  of  strong  character  and  strong  opinions  would  dare contradict it. If you try to put yourself in the position of a Roman of the late fifth century, it is easy to imagine how tempting it would have been to conclude that nothing had changed. That certainty was the optimistic 46</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-48"></a>conclusion. To have thought otherwise might have been frightening. And why  come  to  a  frightening  conclusion  when  a  reassuring  one  was  at hand? </p>

<p class="calibre1">After all, a case could have been made that business would continue as usual. It had in the past. The Roman army, and particularly the frontier garrisons, had been barbarized for centuries<a href="#calibre_link-1">.7 By t</a>he third century, it had become regular practice for the army to proclaim a new emperor. By the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#calibre_link-1">fourth century, even officers were Germanized and frequently illiterate.8</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#calibre_link-1">There  had  been  many  violent  overthrows  of  emperors  before  Romulus</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Augustulus  was  removed  from  the  throne.  His  departure  might  have seemed no different to his contemporaries than many other upheavals in a chaotic time. And he was sent packing with a pension. The very fact that  he  received  a  pension,  even  for  a  brief  period  before  he  was murdered,  was  a  reassurance  that  the  system  survived.  To  an  optimist, Odoacer,  who  deposed  Romulus  Augustulus,  reunified  rather  than destroyed the empire. A son of Attila's sidekick Edecon, Odoacer was a clever man. He did not proclaim himself emperor. Instead, he convened the  Senate  and  prevailed  upon  its  too-suggestible  members  that  they offer  the  emperorship  and  thus  sovereignty  over  the  whole  empire  to Zeno, the Eastern emperor in faraway Byzantium. Odoacer was merely to be Zeno's  <i class="calibre3">patricius</i> to govern Italy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As Will Durant wrote in  <i class="calibre3">The Story of Civilization</i>, these changes did not appear  to  be  the  "fall  of  Rome"  but  merely  "negligible  shifts  on  the surface of the national scene." 7</p>

<p class="calibre1">When  Rome  fell,  Odoacer  said  that  Rome  endured.  He,  along  with almost  everyone  else,  was  keen  to  pretend  that  nothing  had  changed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  knew  that  "the  glory  that  was  Rome"  was  far  better  than  the barbarism that was taking its place. Even the barbarians thought so. As C. W. Previte-Orton wrote in  <i class="calibre3">The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History</i>, 6 Ibid., p. 102. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the  end  of  the  fifth  century,  when  "the  Emperors  had  been  replaced  by barbaric German kings," was a time of "persistent make-believe." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Persistent make-believe" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  "make-believe"  involved  the  preservation  of  the  facade  of  the  old system,  even  as  its  essence  was  "deformed  by  barbarism."9  The  old forms  of  government  remained  the  same  when  the  last  emperor  was replaced  by  a  barbarian  "lieutenant."  The  Senate  still  met.  "The praetorian prefecture and other high offices continued, and were held by eminent Romans." Consuls were still nominated for a year "The Roman civil  administration  survived  intact."  Indeed,  in  some  ways  it  remained intact  until  the  birth  of  feudalism  at  the  end  of  the  tenth  century.  On public  occasions,  the  old  imperial  insignia  was  still  employed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Christianity was still the state religion. The barbarians still pretended to owe fealty to the Eastern emperor in Constantinople, and to the traditions of Roman law. In fact, in Durant's words, "in the West the great Empire was no more." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">So What? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  faraway  example  of  the  fall  of  Rome  is  relevant  for  a  number  of reasons  as  you  contemplate  conditions  in  the  world  today.  Most  books about  the  future  are  really  books  about  the  present.  We  have  sought  to remedy  that  defect  by  making  this  book  about  the  future  first  of  all  a book  about  the  past.  We  think  that  you  are  likely  to  draw  a  better perspective about what the future has in store if we illustrate important megapolitical points about the logic of violence with real examples from the past. </p>

<p class="calibre1">History  is  an  amazing  teacher  The  stories  it  has  to  tell  are  more interesting  than  any  we  could  make  up.  And  many  of  the  more interesting relate to the fall of Rome. They document important lessons that could be relevant to your future in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">First of all, the fall of Rome is one of history's more vivid examples of what happened in a major transition when the scale of government was 48</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-50"></a>collapsing. The transitions of the year 1000 also involved the collapse of central authority, and did so in a way that increased the complexity and scope of economic activity. The Gunpowder Revolution at the end of the fifteenth  century  involved  major  changes  in  institutions  that  tended  to raise rather than shrink the scale of governance. Today, for the first time in  a  thousand  years,  megapolitical  conditions  in  the  West  are undermining  and  destroying  governments  and  many  other  institutions that operate on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  the  collapse  in  the  scale  of  governance  at  the  end  of  the Roman  Empire  had  very  different  causes  from  those  existing  at  the advent  of  the  Information  Age.  Part  of  the  reason  that  Rome  fell  is simply that it had expanded beyond the scale at which the economies of violence could be maintained. The cost of garrisoning the empire's far-flung  borders  exceeded  the  economic  advantages  that  an  ancient agricultural  economy  could  support.  The  burden  of  taxation  and regulation  required  to  finance  the  military  effort  rose  to  exceed  the carrying capacity of the economy. Corruption became endemic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A large part of the effort of military commanders, as historian Ramsay MacMullen has 30</p>

<p class="calibre1">documented, was devoted to pursuit of "illicit profits of their command." </p>

<p class="calibre1">'~ This they pursued by shaking down the population, what the fourth-century observer Synesius described as "the peace-time war, one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from the military's indiscipline and the officers' greed." 14</p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  important  contributing  factor  to  Rome's  collapse  was  a demographic deficit caused by the Antonine plagues. The coil apse of the Roman population in many areas obviously contributed to economic and military weakness. Nothing of that kind has happened today, at least not yet.  Taking  a  longer  view,  perhaps.  the  scourge  of  new  "plagues"  will compound  the  challenges  of  technological  devolution  in  the  new millennium.  The  unprecedented  bulge  in  human  population  in  the twentieth  century  creates  a  tempting  target  for  rapidly  mutating microparasites.  Fears  about  the  Ebola  virus,  or  something  like  it, invading metropolitan populations may be well founded. But this is not the  place  to  consider  the  coevolution  of  humans  and  diseases.  As 49</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-51"></a>interesting  a  topic  as  that  is,  our  argument  at  this  juncture  is  not  about why Rome fell, or even about whether the world today is vulnerable to some  of  the  same  influences  that  contributed  to  Roman  decline.  It  is about  something  different-namely,  the  way  that  history's  great transformations are perceived, or rather, misperceived as they happen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">People are always and everywhere to some degree conservative, with a small "C." </p>

<p class="calibre1">That implies a reluctance to think in terms of dissolving venerable social conventions, overturning the accepted institutions, and defying the laws and  values  from  which  they  drew  their  bearings.  Few  are  inclined  to imagine that apparently minor changes in climate or technology or some other  variable  can  somehow  be  responsible  for  severing  connections  to the  world  of  their  fathers.  The  Romans  were  reluctant  to  acknowledge the changes unfolding around them. So are we. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  recognize  it  or  not,  we  are  living  through  a  change  of  historical season, a transformation in the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves that is so profound that it will inevitably transform the whole  of  society.  The  change  will  be  so  profound,  in  fact,  that  to understand it will require taking almost nothing for granted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  will  be  invited  at  almost  every  turn  to  believe  that  the  coming Information Societies will be very like the industrial society you grew tip in. We doubt it. Microprocessing will dissolve the mortar in the bricks. It will  so  profoundly  alter  the  logic  of  violence  that  it  will  dramatically change the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves, Yet the tendency will be to downplay the inevitability of these changes, or  to  argue  about  their  desirability  as  if  it  were  within  the  fiat  of industrial institutions to determine how history evolves. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Grand Illusion</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Authors  who  are  in  many  ways  better  informed  than  we  are  will nevertheless lead you astray in thinking about the future because they are far too superficial in examining how societies work. For example, David Kline  and  Daniel  Burstein  have  written  a  well-researched  volume entitled Road Warriors: Dreams and Nightmares Along the Information 50</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-52"></a>highway  It  is  full  of  admirable  detail,  but  much  of  this  detail  is marshaled in 31</p>

<p class="calibre1">arguing an illusion, the idea "that citizens can act together, consciously, to  shape  the  spontaneous  economic  and  natural  processes  going  on around  them."  Although  it  may  not  be  obvious,  this  is  equivalent  to saying  that  feudalism  might  have  survived  if  everyone  had  rededicated himself to chivalry. No one in a court of the late fifteenth century would have objected to such a sentiment. Indeed, it would have been heresy to do so. But it also would have been entirely misleading, an example of the snake trying to fit the future into its old skin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  most  profound  causes  of  change  are  precisely  those  that  are  not subject to conscious control. They are the factors that alter the conditions under which violence pays. Indeed, they are so remote from any obvious means  of  manipulation  that  they  are  not  even  subjects  of  political maneuvering in a world saturated with politics. No one ever marched in a  demonstration  shouting,  "Increase  scale  economies  in  the  production process." No banner has ever demanded, "Invent a weapons system that increases the importance of the infantry." No candidate ever promised to</p>

<p class="calibre1">"alter the balance between efficiency and magnitude in protection against violence."  Such  slogans  would  be  ridiculous,  precisely  because  their goals are beyond the capacity of anyone to consciously affect. Yet as we will  explore,  these  variables  determine  how  the  world  works  to  a  far greater degree than any political platform. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  think  about  it  carefully,  it  should  be  obvious  that  important transitions in history seldom are driven primarily by human wishes. They do  not  happen  because  people  get  fed  up  with  one  way  of  life  and suddenly  prefer  another  A  moment's  reflection  suggests  why.  If  what people  think  and  desire  were  the  only  determinants  of  what  happens, then all the abrupt changes in history would have to be explained by wild mood swings unconnected to any change in the actual conditions of life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">in fact, this never happens. Only in cases of medical problems affecting a few people do we see arbitrary fluctuations in mood that appear entirely divorced from any objective cause. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As a rule, large numbers of people do not suddenly and all at once decide to abandon their way of life simply because they find it amusing to do 51</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-53"></a>so.  No  forager  ever  said,  "I  am  tired  of  living  in  prehistoric  times,  I would  prefer  the  life  of  a  peasant  in  a  farming  village."  Any  decisive swing in patterns of behavior and values is invariably a response to an actual change in the conditions of life. In this sense, at least, people are always realistic. If their views do change abruptly, it probably indicates that  they  have  been  confronted  by  some  departure  from  familiar conditions:  an  invasion,  a  plague,  a  sudden  climatic  shift,  or  a technological  revolution  that  alters  their  livelihoods  or  their  ability  to defend themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Far  from  being  the  product  of  human  desire,  decisive  historic  changes more  often  than  not  confound  the  wish  of  most  people  for  stability. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  change  occurs,  it  typically  causes  widespread  disorientation, especially among those who lose income or social status. You will look in  vain  at  public  opinion  polls  or  other  measures  of  mood  for  an understanding  of  how  the  coming  megapolitical  transition  is  likely  to unfold. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">L1FE WITHOUT FORESIGHT</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">32</p>

<p class="calibre1">If we fail to perceive the great transition going on around us, it is partly because we do not desire to see. Our foraging forebears may have been just as obdurate, but they had a better excuse. No one ten thousand years ago  could  have  foreseen  the  consequences  of  the  Agricultural Revolution.  In-deed,  no  one  could  have  foreseen  much  of  anything beyond where to find the next meal. When farming began, there was no record  of  past  events  from  which  to  draw  perspective  on  the  future. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There was not even a Western sense of time divided into orderly units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on, to measure out the years. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Foragers  lived  in  the  "eternal  present,"  without  calendars,  and  indeed, without  written  records  at  all.  They  had  no  science,  and  no  other intellectual  apparatus  for  understanding  cause  and  effect  beyond  their own intuitions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  it  came  to  looking  ahead,  our  primeval  ancestors  were  blind.  To cite  the  biblical  metaphor,  they  had  not  yet  eaten  of  the  fruit  of knowledge. </p>

<p class="calibre1">52</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-54"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Learning from the Past</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Luckily,  we  have  a  better  vantage  point.  The  past  five  hundred generations have given us analytic capabilities that our forebears lacked. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Science  and  mathematics  have  helped  unlock  many  of  nature's  secrets, giving  us  an  understanding  of  cause  and  effect  that  approaches  the magical  when  compared  to  that  of  the  early  foragers.  Computational algorithms developed as a result of high-speed computers have shed new insights  on  the  workings  of  complex,  dynamic  systems  like  the  human economy.  The  painstaking  development  of  political  economy  itself{</p>

<p class="calibre1">although it falls well short of perfection, has honed understanding of the factors  informing  human  action.  Important  among  these  is  the recognition  that  people  at  all  times  and  places  tend  to  respond  to incentives. Not always as mechanically as economists imagine, but they do  respond.  Costs  and  rewards  matter.  Changes  in  external  conditions that raise the rewards or lower the costs of certain behavior will lead to more of that behavior, other things being equal. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Incentives Matter</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that people tend to respond to costs and rewards is an essential element  of  forecasting.  You  can  say  with  a  high  degree  of  confidence that  if  you  drop  a  hundred-dollar  bill  on  the  street,  someone  will  soon pick it up, whether you are in New York, Mexico City, or Moscow. This is not as trivial as it seems. It shows why the clever people who say that forecasting  is  impossible  are  wrong.  Any  forecast  that  accurately anticipates  the  impact  of  incentives  on  behavior  is  likely  to  be  broadly correct. And the greater the anticipated change in costs and rewards, the less trivial the implied forecast is likely to be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The most far-reaching forecasts of all are likely to arise from recognizing the  implications  of  shifting  megapolitical  variables.  Violence  is  the ultimate boundary force on behavior; thus, if you can understand how the logic of violence will change, you can usefully predict where people will be dropping or picking up the equivalent of one-hundred-dollar bills in the future. </p>

<p class="calibre1">33</p>

<p class="calibre1">53</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-55"></a>We do not mean by this that you can know the unknowable. We cannot tell  you  how  to  forecast  winning  lottery  numbers  or  any  truly  random event.  We  have  no  way  of  knowing  when  or  whether  a  terrorist  will detonate an atomic blast in Manhattan. Or if an asteroid will strike Saudi Arabia.  We  cannot  predict  the  coming  of  a  new  Ice  Age,  a  sudden volcanic  eruption,  or  the  emergence  of  a  new  disease.  The  number  of unknowable  events  that  could  alter  the  course  of  history  is  large.  But knowing  the  unknowable  is  very  different  from  drawing  out  the implications of what is already known. If you see a flash of lightning far away,  you  can  forecast  with  a  high  degree  of  confidence  that  a thunderclap  is  due.  Forecasting  the  consequences  of  megapolitical transitions  involves  much  longer  time  frames,  and  less  certain connections, but it is a similar kind of exercise. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Megapolitical  catalysts  for  change  usually  appear  well  before  their consequences  manifest  themselves.  It  took  five  thousand  years  for  the full implications of the Agricultural Revolution to come to the surface. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The transition from an agricultural society to an industrial society based on  manufacturing  and  chemical  power  unfolded  more  quickly.  It  took centuries.  The  transition  to  the  Information  Society  will  happen  more rapidly  still,  probably  within  a  lifetime.  Yet  even  allowing  for  the foreshortening of history, you can expect decades to pass before the full megapolitical impact of existing information technology is realized. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Major and Minor Megapolitical Transitions</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  chapter  analyzes  some  of  the  common  features  of  megapolitical transitions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  following  chapters  we  look  more  closely  at  the  Agricultural Revolution,  and  the  transition  from  farm  to  factory,  the  second  of  the previous  great  phase  changes.  Within  the  agricultural  stage  of civilization there were many minor megapolitical transitions such as the fall of Rome and the feudal revolution of the year I 0OO~ These marked the waxing and waning of the power equation as governments rose and fell  and  the  spoils  of  farming  passed  from  one  set  of  hands  to  another. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  owners  of  sprawling  estates  under  the  Roman  Empire,  yeoman farmers in the European Dark Ages, and the lords and serfs of the feudal period all ate grain from the same fields. They lived under very different 54</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-56"></a>governments because of the cumulative impact of different technologies, fluctuations in climate, and the disruptive influences of disease. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Our purpose is not to thoroughly explain all of these changes. We do not pretend to do so, although we have sketched out some illustrations of the way  that  changing  megapolitical  variables  have  altered  the  way  that power was exercised in the past. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments have grown and shrunk as megapolitical fluctuations have lowered and raised the costs of projecting power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Here are some summary points that you should keep in mind as you seek to understand the Information Revolution:</p>

<p class="calibre1">34</p>

<p class="calibre1">1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A shift in the megapolitical foundations of power normally unfolds far in advance of the actual revolutions in the use of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Incomes  are  usually  falling  when  a  major  transition  begins,  often because  a  society  has  rendered  itself  crisis-prone  by  marginalizing resources due to population pressures. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Seeing "outside" of a system is usually taboo. People are frequently blind to the logic of violence in the existing society; therefore, they are almost always  blind  to  changes  in  that  logic,  latent  or  overt.  Megapolitical transitions are seldom recognized before they happen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Major transitions always involve a cultural revolution, and usually entail clashes between adherents of the old and new values. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">55</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-57"></a>Megapolitical  transitions  are  never  popular,  because  they  antiquate painstakingly  acquired  intellectual  capital  and  confound  established moral imperatives. They are not undertaken by popular demand, but in response  to  changes  in  the  external  conditions  that  alter  the  logic  of violence in the local setting. </p>

<p class="calibre1">6. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Transitions  to  new  ways  of  organizing  livelihoods  or  new  types  of government are initially confined to those areas where the megapolitical catalysts are at work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">7. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With  the  possible  exception  of  the  early  stages  of  farming,  past transitions have always involved periods of social chaos and heightened violence due to disorientation and breakdown of the old system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">8. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Corruption, moral decline, and inefficiency appear to be signal features of the final stages of a system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">9. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The growing importance of technology in shaping the logic of violence has  led  to  an  acceleration  of  history,  leaving  each  successive  transition with less adaptive time than ever before. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">History Speeds Up</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">With  events  unfolding  many  times  faster  than  during  previous transformations, early understanding of how the world will change could turn  out  to  be  far  more  useful  to  you  than  it  would  have  been  to  your ancestors at an equivalent juncture in the past. Even if the first farmers had miraculously understood the full megapolitical implications of tilling the  earth,  this  information  would  have  been  practically  useless  because thousands of years were to pass before the transition to the new phase of society was complete. </p>

<p class="calibre1">56</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-58"></a>Not so today. History has sped up. Forecasts that correctly anticipate the megapolitical  implications  of  new  technology  are  likely  to  be  far  more useful today. If we can develop the implications of the current transition to the Information Society to the same extent that someone with current knowledge  could  have  grasped  the  implications  of  past  transitions  to farm and factory, that information should be many times more valuable now.  Put  simply,  the  action  horizon  for  megapolitical  forecasts  has shrunk to its most useful range, within the span of a single lifetime. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Looking back over the centuries, or even f looking only at the present,</i> <i class="calibre3">we can clearly observe</i> <i class="calibre3">that  many  men  have  made  their  living,  Often  a</i> <i class="calibre3">very good living, from their special skill in</i> 35</p>

<p class="calibre1">FREDERIC C. LANE</p>

<p class="calibre1">Our  study  of  megapolitics  is  an  attempt  to  do  just  that-to  draw  out  the implications  of  the  changing  factors  that  alter  the  boundaries  where violence is exercised. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These megapolitical factors largely determine when and where violence pays.  They  also  help  inform  the  market  distribution  of  income.  As economic  historian  Frederic  Lane  so  clearly  put  it,  how  violence  is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining "what uses are made of scarce resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">57</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-59"></a><b class="calibre4">A CRASH COURSE IN MEGAPOLITICS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The concept of megapolitics is a powerful one. It helps illuminate some of  the  major  mysteries  of  history:  how  governments  rise  and  fall  and what types of institutions they become; the timing and outcome of wars; patterns of economic prosperity and decline. By raising or lowering the costs and rewards of projecting power, megapolitics governs the ability of  people  to  impose  their  will  on  others.  This  has  been  true  from  the earliest  human  societies  onward.  It  still  is.  We  explored  many  of  the important  hidden  megapolitical  factors  that  determine  the  evolution  of history  in   <i class="calibre3">Blood  in  the  Streets</i>  and   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning. </i> The  key  to unlocking the implications of megapolitical change is understanding the factors that precipitate revolutions in the use of violence. These variables can  be  somewhat  arbitrarily  grouped  into  four  categories:  topography, climate, microbes, and technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">1.  <i class="calibre3">Topography</i> is a crucial factor, as evidenced by the fact that control of violence on the open seas has never been monopolized as it has on land. </p>

<p class="calibre1">No  government's  laws  have  ever  exclusively  applied  there.  This  is  a matter of the utmost importance in understanding how the organization of  violence  and  protection  will  evolve  as  the  economy  migrates  into cyberspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Topography,  in  conjunction  with  climate,  had  a  major  role  to  play  in early history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The first states emerged on floodplains, surrounded by desert, such as in Mesopotamia  and  Egypt,  where  water  for  irrigation  was  plentiful  but surrounding  regions  were  too  dry  to  support  yeoman  farming.  Under such conditions, individual farmers faced a very high cost for failing to cooperate in maintaining the political structure. Without irrigation, which could be provided only on a large scale, crops would not grow. No crops meant  starvation.  The  conditions  that  placed  those  who  controlled  the water  in  a  desert  in  a  position  of  strength  made  for  despotic  and  rich government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  analyzed  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>,  topographic  conditions  also played  a  major  role  in  the  prosperity  of  yeoman  farmers  in  ancient 58</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-60"></a>Greece, enabling that region to become the cradle of Western democracy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Given  the  primitive  transportation  conditions  prevailing  in  the Mediterranean region three thousand years ago, it was all but impossible for persons living more than a few miles from the sea to compete in the production of high-value crops of the ancient world, olives and grapes. If the  oil  and  the  wine  had  to  be  transported  any  distance  overland,  the portage costs were so great that they could not be 36</p>

<p class="calibre1">sold at a profit. The elaborate shoreline of the Greek littoral meant that most areas of Greece were no more than twenty miles from the sea. This gave  a  decisive  advantage  to  Greek  farmers  over  their  potential competitors in landlocked areas. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because of this advantage in trading high-value products, Greek farmers earned  high  incomes  from  control  of  only  small  parcels  of  land.  These high  incomes  enabled  them  to  purchase  costly  armor.  The  famous hoplites  of  ancient  Greece  were  farmers  or  landlords  who  armed themselves at their own expense. Both well armed and well motivated, the Greek hoplites were militarily formidable and could not be ignored. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Topographic conditions were the foundation of Greek democracy, just as those  of  a  different  kind  gave  rise  to  the  Oriental  despotisms  of  Egypt and elsewhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Climate</i>  also  helps  set  the  boundaries  within  which  brute  force  can  be exercised. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  climatic  change  was  the  catalyst  for  the  first  major  transition  from foraging to farming. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The end of the last Ice Age, about thirteen thousand years ago, led to a radical  alteration  in  vegetation.  Beginning  in  the  Near  East,  where  the Ice Age retreated first, a gradual rise in temperature and rainfall spread forests into areas that had previously been grasslands. In particular, the rapid  spread  of  beech  forests  seriously  curtailed  the  human  diet.  As Susan Alling Gregg put it in Foragers and Farmers: The establishment of beech forests must have had serious consequences for local human, plant 59</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-61"></a>and animal populations. The canopy of an oak forest is relatively open and  allows  large  amounts  of  sunlight  to  reach  the  forest  floor.  An exuberant undergrowth of mixed shrubs, forbs, and grasses develops, and the  diversity  of  plants  supports  a  variety  of  wildlife.  In  contrast,  the canopy of a beech forest is closed and the forest floor is heavily shaded. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Other than a flush of spring annuals prior to the emergence of the leaves, only shade-tolerant sedges, ferns, and a few grasses are found." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Over  time,  dense  forests  encroached  on  the  open  plains,  spreading throughout  Europe  into  the  Eastern  steppes.  The  forests  reduced  the grazing  area  available  to  support  large  animals,  making  it  increasingly difficult for the population of human foragers to support themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The population of hunter-gatherers had swollen too greatly during the Ice Age  prosperity  to  support  itself  on  the  dwindling  herds  of  large mammals,  many  species  of  which  were  hunted  to  extinction.  The transition  to  agriculture  was  not  a  choice  of  preference,  but  an improvisation adopted under duress to make up for shortfalls in the diet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Foraging  continued  to  predominate  in  those  areas  farther  north,  where the  warming  trend  had  not  adversely  affected  the  habitats  of  large mammals,  and  in  tropical  rainforests,  where  the  global  warming  trend did  not  have  the  perverse  effect  of  reducing  food  supplies.  Since  the advent  of  farming,  it  has  been  far  more  common  for  changes  to  be precipitated by the cooling rather than the warming of the climate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  modest  understanding  of  the  dynamics  of  climatic  change  in  past societies  could  well  prove  useful  in  the  event  that  climates  continue  to fluctuate. If you know that a drop of one degree Centigrade on average reduces  the  growing  season  by  three  to  four  weeks  and  shaves  five hundred  feet  off  the  maximum  elevation  at  which  crops  can  be  grown, then  you  know  something  about  the  boundary  conditions  that  will confine  people's  action  in  the  future.  You  can  use  this  knowledge  to forecast changes in 37</p>

<p class="calibre1">everything  from  grain  prices  to  land  values.  You  may  even  be  able  to draw  informed  conclusions  about  the  likely  impact  of  falling temperatures  on  real  incomes  and  political  stability.  In  the  past, governments  have  been  overthrown  when  crop  failures  extending  over several years raised food prices and shrank disposable incomes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">60</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-62"></a>For  example,  it  is  no  coincidence  that  the  seventeenth  century,  the coldest in the modern period, was also a period of revolution worldwide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  hidden  megapolitical  cause  of  this  unhappiness  was  sharply  colder weather. It was so cold, in fact, that wine froze on the "Sun King's" table at  Versailles.  Shortened  growing  seasons  produced  crop  failures  and undermined  real  income.  Because  of  the  colder  weather,  prosperity began  to  wind  down  into  a  long  global  depression  that  began  around 1620.  It  proved  drastically  destabilizing.  The  economic  crisis  of  the seventeenth  century  led  to  the  world  being  overwhelmed  by  rebellions, many clustering in 1648, exactly two hundred years before another and more  famous  cycle  of  rebellions.  Between  1640  and  1650,  there  were rebellions  in  Ireland,  Scotland,  England,  Portugal,  Catalonia,  France, Moscow,  Naples,  Sicily,  Brazil,  Bohemia,  Ukraine,  Austria,  Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even China and Japan were swept with unrest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  may  also  be  no  coincidence  that  mercantilism  predominated  in  the seventeenth century during a period of shrinking trade. Economic closure was perhaps most pronounced at the end of the century, "when a terrible famine  occurred."  By  the  eighteenth  century,  especially  after  1750, warmer  temperatures  and  higher  crop  yields  had  begun  to  raise  real incomes  in  Western  Europe  sufficiently  to  expand  demand  for manufactured  goods.  More  free-market  policies  were  adopted.  This  led to a self-reinforcing burst of economic growth as industry expanded to a larger scale in what is commonly described as the Industrial Revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The growing importance of technology and manufactured output reduced the impact of the weather on economic cycles. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  today,  however,  you  should  not  underestimate  the  impact  of suddenly  colder  weather  in  lowering  real  incomes-even  in  wealthy regions such as North America. There is a strong tendency for societies to  render  themselves  crisis-prone  when  the  existing  configuration  of institutions  has  exhausted  its  potential.  In  the  past,  this  tendency  has often been manifested by population increases that stretched the carrying capacity of land to the limit. This happened both before the transition of the year 1000 and again at the end of the fifteenth century. The plunge in real income caused by crop failures and lower yields played a significant role in both instances in destroying the predominant institutions. Today 61</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-63"></a>the  marginalization  is  manifested  in  the  consumer  credit  markets.  If sharply  colder  weather  reduced  crop  yields  and  lowered  disposable incomes, this would lead to debt default as well as tax rebellions. If the past  is  a  guide,  both  economic  closure  and  political  instability  could result. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Microbes</i>  convey  power  to  harm  or  immunity  from  harm  in  ways  that have often determined how power was exercised. This was certainly the case in the European conquest of the New World, as we explored in  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Great  Reckoning</i>.  European  settlers,  arriving  from  settled  agricultural societies riddled with disease, brought with them relative immunity from childhood  infections  like  measles.  The  Indians  they  encountered  lived largely  in  thinly  populated  foraging  bands.  They  possessed  no  such immunity and 38</p>

<p class="calibre1">were  decimated.  Often,  the  greatest  mortality  occurred  before  white people even arrived, as Indians who first encountered Europeans on the coasts traveled inland with infections. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There are also microbiological barriers to the exercise of power. In  <i class="calibre3">Blood</i> <i class="calibre3">in the</i> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i>, we discussed the role that potent strains of malaria served in making tropical Africa impervious to invasion by white men for many centuries. Before the discovery of quinine in the mid-nineteenth century, white  armies  could  not  survive  in  malarial  regions,  however  superior their weapons might have been. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  interaction  between  humans  and  microbes  has  also  produced important  demographic  effects  that  altered  the  costs  and  rewards  of violence.  When  fluctuations  in  mortality  are  high  due  to  epidemic disease, famine, or other causes, the relative risk of mortality in warfare falls.  The  declining  frequency  of  eruptions  in  death  rates  from  the sixteenth  century  onward  helps  explain  smaller  family  size  and, ultimately,  the  far  lower  tolerance  of  sudden  death  in  war  today  as compared to the past. This has had the effect of lowering the tolerance for  imperialism  and  raising  the  costs  of  projecting  power  in  societies with low birthrates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">62</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-64"></a>Contemporary  societies,  comprising  small  families,  tend  to  find  even small  numbers  of  battle  deaths  intolerable.  By  contrast,  early  modern societies were much more tolerant of the mortality costs associated with imperialism.  Before  this  century,  most  parents  gave  birth  to  many children,  some  of  whom  were  expected  to  die  randomly  and  suddenly from  disease.  In  an  era  when  early  death  was  commonplace,  would-be soldiers and their families faced the dangers of the battlefield with less resistance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Technology</i> has played by far the largest role in determining the costs and rewards of projecting power during the modern centuries. The argument of this book presumes it will continue to do so. Technology has several crucial dimensions: A. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Balance between offense and defense</i>. The balance between the offense and  the  defense  implied  by  prevailing  weapons  technology  helps determine the scale of political organization. When offensive capabilities are  rising,  the  ability  to  project  power  at  a  distance  predominates, jurisdictions tend to consolidate, and governments form on a larger scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At other times, like now, defensive capabilities are rising. This makes it more costly to project power outside of core areas. Jurisdictions tend to devolve, and big governments break down into smaller ones. </p>

<p class="calibre1">B. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Equality  and  the  predominance  of  the  infantry. </i> A  key  feature determining  the  degree  of  equality  among  citizens  is  the  nature  of weapons technology. Weapons that are relatively cheap, can be employed by  nonprofessionals,  and  enhance  the  military  importance  of  infantry tend to equalize power. When Thomas Jefferson wrote that "all men are created equal," he was saying something that was much more true than a similar statement would have seemed centuries earlier. A farmer with his hunting  rifle  was  not  only  as  well  armed  as  the  typical  British  soldier with  his  Brown  Bess,  he  was  better  armed.  The  farmer  with  the  rifle could  shoot  at  the  soldier  from  a  greater  distance,  and  with  greater accuracy than the soldier could return fire. This was a distinctly different 63</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-65"></a>circumstance from the Middle Ages, when a farmer with a pitchfork-he could not have afforded more-could 39</p>

<p class="calibre1">scarcely  have  hoped  to  stand  against  a  heavily  armed  knight  on horseback. No one was writing in 1276 that "all men are created equal." </p>

<p class="calibre1">At that time, in the most manifestly important sense, men were not equal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A single knight exercised far more brute force than dozens of peasants put together. </p>

<p class="calibre1">C. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Advantages and disadvantages of scale in violence. </i> Another variable that helps  determine  whether  there  are  a  few  large  governments  or  many small ones is the scale of organization required to deploy the prevailing weapons.  When  there  are  increasing  returns  to  violence,  it  is  more rewarding to operate governments at a large scale, and they tend to get bigger. When a small group can command effective means of resisting an assault  by  a  large  group,  which  was  the  case  during  the  Middle  Ages, sovereignty  tends  to  fragment.  Small,  independent  authorities  exercise many of the functions of government. As we explore in a latter chapter, we  believe  that  the  Information  Age  will  bring  the  dawn  of cybersoldiers, who will be heralds of devolution. Cybersoldiers could be deployed not merely by nationstates but by very small organizations, and even  by  individuals.  Wars  of  the  next  millennium  will  include  some almost bloodless battles fought with computers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">D. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Economies of scale in production. </i> Another important factor that weighs in the balance in determining whether ultimate power is exercised locally or from a distance is the scale of the predominant enterprises in which people  gain  their  livelihoods.  When  crucial  enterprises  can  function optimally  only  when  they  are  organized  on  a  large  scale  in  an encompassing  trading  area,  governments  that  expand  to  provide  such  a setting  for  enterprises  under  their  protection  may  rake  off  enough additional wealth to pay the costs of maintaining a large political system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, the entire world economy usually functions more effectively where one supreme world power dominates all others, as the British  Empire  did  in  the  nineteenth  century.  But  sometimes 64</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-66"></a>megapolitical variables combine to produce falling economies of scale. If the economic benefits of maintaining a large trading area dwindle, larger governments  that  previously  prospered  from  exploiting  the  benefits  of larger  trading  areas  may  begin  to  break  apart-even  if  the  balance  of weaponry between offense and defense otherwise remains much as it had been. </p>

<p class="calibre1">E. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dispersal of technology. </i> Still another factor that contributes to the power equation is the degree of dispersal of key technologies. When weapons or tools of production can be effectively hoarded or monopolized, they tend to centralize power. Even technologies that are essentially defensive in  character,  like  the  machine  gun,  proved  to  be  potent  offensive weapons,  that  contributed  to  a  rising  scale  of  governance  during  the period when they were not widely dispersed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When the European powers enjoyed a monopoly on machine guns late in the  nineteenth  century,  they  were  able  to  use  those  weapons  against peoples at the periphery to dramatically expand colonial empires. Later, in  the  twentieth  century,  when  machine  guns  became  widely  available, especially  in  the  wake  of  World  War  II,  they  were  deployed  to  help destroy the power of empires. Other things being equal, the more widely dispersed key technologies are, the more 40</p>

<p class="calibre1">widely  dispersed  power  will  tend  to  be,  and  the  smaller  the  optimum scale of government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">65</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-67"></a><b class="calibre4">THE SPEED OF MEGAPOLITICAL CHANGE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">While  technology  is  by  far  the  most  important  factor  today,  and apparently  growing  more  so,  all  four  major  megapolitical  factors  have played a role in determining the scale at which power could be exercised in the past. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Together,  these  factors  determine  whether  the  returns  to  violence continue  to  rise  as  violence  is  employed  on  a  larger  scale.  This determines  the  importance  of  magnitude  of  firepower  versus  efficiency in  employing  resources.  It  also  strongly  influences  the  market distribution of income. The question is, What role will they command in the future? A key to estimating an answer lies in recognizing that these megapolitical variables mutate at dramatically different speeds. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Topography has been almost fixed through the whole of recorded history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Except for minor local effects involving the silting of harbors, landfills, or erosion, the topography of the earth is almost the same today as it was when Adam and Eve straggled out of Eden. And it is likely to remain so until another Ice Age recarves the landscapes of continents or some other drastic event disturbs the surface of the earth. At a more profound scale, geological  ages  seem  to  shift,  perhaps  in  response  to  large  meteorite strikes,  over  a  period  of  10  to  40  million  years.  Someday,  there  may again be geological upheavals that will alter significantly the topography of  our  planet.  If  that  happens,  you  can  safely  assume  that  both  the baseball and cricket seasons will be canceled. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Climate  fluctuates  much  more  actively  than  topography.  In  the  last million  years,  climatic  change  has  been  responsible  for  most  of  the known variation in the features of the earth's surface. During Ice Ages, glaciers gouged new valleys, altered the course of rivers, severed islands from continents or joined them together by lowering the sea level. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Fluctuations in climate have played a significant role in history, first in precipitating  the  Agricultural  Revolution  after  the  close  of  the  last  Ice Age,  and  later  in  destablizing  regimes  during  periods  of  colder temperatures and drought. </p>

<p class="calibre1">66</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-68"></a>Lately,  there  have  been  concerns  over  the  possible  impact  of  "global warming." </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  concerns  cannot  be  dismissed  out  of  hand.  Yet,  taking  a  longer perspective, the more likely risk appears to be a shift toward a colder, not a warmer climate. Study of temperature fluctuations based upon analysis of oxygen isotopes in core samples taken from the ocean floor show that the current period is the second warmest in more than 2</p>

<p class="calibre1">million years<a href="#calibre_link-1">.22</a>  If  temperatures  were  to  turn  colder,  as  they  did  in  the seventeenth  century,  that  might  prove  megapolitically  destabilizing. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Current alarms about global warming may in that sense be reassuring. To the extent that they are true, that assures that temperatures will continue to  fluctuate  within  the  abnormally  warm  and  relatively  benign  range experienced for the past three centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The rate of change in the influence of microbes on the exercise of power is more of a puzzle. Microbes can mutate very rapidly. This is especially true of viruses. The 22</p>

<p class="calibre1">41</p>

<p class="calibre1">common cold, for example, mutates in an almost kaleidoscopic way. Yet although  these  mutations  proceed  apace,  their  impact  in  shifting  the boundaries  where  power  is  exercised  have  been  far  less  abrupt  than technological change. Why? Part of the reason is that the normal balance of  nature  tends  to  make  it  beneficial  for  microbes  to  infect  but  not destroy  host  populations.  Virulent  infections  that  kill  their  hosts  too readily  tend  to  eradicate  themselves  in  the  process.  The  survival  of microparasites  depends  upon  their  not  being  too  rapidly  or  uniformly fatal to the hosts they invade. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  there  cannot  be  deadly  eruptions  of disease  that  alter  the  balance  of  power.  Such  episodes  have  figured prominently in history. The Black Death wiped out large fractions of the population of Eurasia and dealt a crushing blow to the fourteenth-century version of the international economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">What Might Have Been</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">67</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-69"></a>History can be understood in terms of what might have been as well as what was. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We know of no reason that microparasites could not have continued to play havoc with human society during the modern period. For example, it  is  possible  that  microbiological  barriers  to  the  exercise  of  power, equivalent  to  malaria  but  more  virulent,  could  have  halted  the  Western invasion  of  the  periphery  in  its  tracks.  The  first  intrepid  Portuguese adventurers  who  sailed  into  African  waters  could  have  contracted  a deadly  retrovirus,  a  more  communicable  version  of  AIDS,  that  would have stopped the opening of the new trade route to Asia before it even began. Columbus, too, and the first waves of settlers in the New World might  have  encountered  diseases  that  decimated  them  in  the  same  way that  indigenous  local  populations  were  affected  by  measles  and  other Western  childhood  diseases.  Yet  nothing  of  the  kind  happened,  a coincidence that underlines the intuition that history has a destiny. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Microbes  did  far  less  to  impede  the  consolidation  of  power  in  the' </p>

<p class="calibre1">modern  period  than  to  facilitate  it.  Western  troops  and  colonists  at  the periphery  often  found  that  the  technological  advantages  that  allowed them  to  project  power  were  underscored  by  microbiological  ones. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Westerners  were  armed  with  unseen  biological  weapons,  their  relative immunity  to  childhood  diseases  that  frequently  devastated  native peoples. This gave voyagers from the West a distinct advantage that their antagonists from less densely settled regions lacked. As events unfolded, the  disease  transfer  was  almost  entirely  in  one  direction-from  Europe outward.  There  was  no  equivalent  transfer  of  disease  in  the  other direction, from the periphery to the core. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As a possible counterexample, some have claimed that Western explorers imported  syphilis  from  the  New  World  to  Europe.  This  is  arguable.  If true, however, it did not prove to be a significant barrier to the exercise of power. The major impact of syphilis was to shift sexual mores in the West. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From the end of the fifteenth century to the last quarter of the twentieth, the  impact  of  microbes  on  industrial  society  was  ever  more  benign. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  personal  tragedies  and  unhappiness  caused  by outbreaks of tuberculosis, polio, and flu, no new diseases emerged in the 68</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-70"></a>modern  period  that  even  approached  the  megapolitical  impact  of  the Antonine plagues or the Black Death. Improving public health, and the 42</p>

<p class="calibre1">advent  of  vaccinations  and  antidotes,  generally  reduced  the  importance of infectious microbes during the modern period, thereby increasing the relative importance of technology in setting the boundaries where power was exercised. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The recent emergence of AIDS and alarms over the potential spread of exotic viruses are hints that the role of microbes may not be altogether as megapolitically  benign  in  the  future  as  it  has  been  over  the  past  five hundred years. But when or whether a new plague will infect the world is unknowable.  An  eruption  of  microparasites,  such  as  a  viral  pandemic, rather than drastic changes in climate or topography, would more likely disrupt the megapolitical predominance of technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  have  no  way  of  monitoring  or  anticipating  drastic  departures  from the nature of life on earth as we have known it. We cross our fingers and assume  that  the  major  megapolitical  variables  in  the  next  millennium will  be  technological  rather  than  microbiological.  If  luck  continues  to side with humanity, technology will continue to grow in prominence as the leading megapolitical variable. It was not always such, however, as a review  of  the  first  great  megapolitical  transformation,  the  Agricultural Revolution, clearly shows. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4:9-10</p>

<p class="calibre1">Five hundred generations ago, the first phase change in the organization of  human  society  bega<a href="#calibre_link-1">n.1  Our  </a>ancestors  in  several  regions  reluctantly picked up crude implements, sharpened stakes and makeshift hoes, and went  to  work.  As  they  sowed  the  first  crops,  they  also  laid  a  new foundation for power in the world. The Agricultural Revolution was the first great economic and social revolution. It started with the expulsion from  Eden  and  moved  so  slowly  that  farming  had  not  completely displaced hunting and gathering in all suitable areas of the globe when the twentieth century opened. Experts believe that even in the Near East, where  farming  first  emerged,  it  was  introduced  in  "a  long  incremental process" that "may have taken five thousand years or more<a href="#calibre_link-1">."2</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">It may seem an exaggeration to describe a process that stretched out over millennia  as  a  "revolution."  Yet  that  is  precisely  what  the  advent  of farming  was,  a  slow-motion  revolution  that  transformed  human  life  by altering the logic of violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Wherever  farming  took  root,  violence  emerged  as  a  more  important feature of social life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hierarchies  adept  at  manipulating  or  controlling  violence  came  to dominate society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Understanding  the  Agricultural  Revolution  is  a  first  step  toward understanding  the  Information  Revolution.  The  introduction  of  tilling and  harvesting  provides  a  paradigm  example  of  how  an  apparently simple shift in the character of work can radically alter the organization of society. Put this past revolution into perspective and you are in a far 70</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-72"></a>stronger position to forecast how history may unfold in response to the new logic of violence introduced with microprocessors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To appreciate the revolutionary character of agriculture, you first need a picture  of  how  the  primeval  society  functioned  before  farming.  We surveyed this in  <i class="calibre3">The Great</i> <i class="calibre3">Reckoning</i> and offer a further sketch below. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hunting-and  gathering  societies  were  the  only  forms  of  social organization  through  a  long,  prehistoric  slumber  when  human  life changed little or not at all from generation to generation. Anthropologists claim that humans have been hunters and gatherers for 99 percent of the time since we appeared on earth. Crucial to the long success and ultimate failure of hunting-and-gathering bands is the fact that they had to operate on a very small scale over a very wide area. </p>

<p class="calibre1">1 Boyden, op. cit., p.4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2 Gregg, op. ciL, xv. </p>

<p class="calibre1">44</p>

<p class="calibre1">Foragers  could  survive  only  where  population  densities  were  light.  To see why, think of the problems that larger groups would have posed. For one  thing,  a  thousand  hunters  parading  together  across  a  landscape would have raised such a ruckus as to scare away the game they sought to  trap.  And  even  worse,  had  a  small  army  of  hunters  occasionally managed  to  corner  a  huge  herd  of  game,  the  food  they  harvested, including  fruits  and  edible  plants  found  in  the  wild,  could  not  have remained  plentiful  for  long.  A  large  group  of  foragers  would  have  laid waste to the countryside through overharvesting like a starving army in the Thirty Years War. Therefore, to minimize overkill, hunting bands had to  be  small.  As  Stephen  Boyden  writes  in  Western  Civilization  in Biological Perspective, "Most commonly, hunter-gatherer groups number between twenty-five and fifty individuals." </p>

<p class="calibre1">To  live  on  ten  thousand  acres  in  a  temperate  climate  today  is  a  luxury allowed  only  to  the  very  rich.  A  family  of  hunter-gatherers  could scarcely have survived on less. </p>

<p class="calibre1">71</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-73"></a>They generally required thousands of acres per person, even in areas that were most fertile for foraging. This suggests why the growth of human populations  during  periods  particularly  favorable  to  farming  may  have created the basis for population crises. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  so  much  land  was  required  to  support  a  single  person,  the population  densities  of  hunting-and-gathering  societies  had  to  be incredibly sparse. Before farming, humans were about as densely settled as bears. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With minor differences, the human diet resembled that of bears. Foraging societies  depended  upon  food  gathered  from  the  open  countryside  or from nearby bodies of water. Although some gatherers were fishers, most were  hunters  who  depended  for  a  third  to  a  fifth  of  their  food  upon protein from large mammals. Other than a few simple tools and objects carried around with them, hunter-gatherers had almost no technology at their disposal. They usually had no way to effectively store quantities of meat  or  other  foods  for  later  use.  Most  food  had  to  be  consumed  soon after it was gathered or left to spoil. That is not say, of course, that some hunter-gatherers did not eat spoiled food. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Eskimos,  as  Boyden  reports,  "are  said  to  have  a  particular  liking  for decomposed food."4</p>

<p class="calibre1">He repeats the observations of experts that Eskimos" 'bury fish heads and allow them to decay until the bones become of the same consistency as the flesh. They then knead the reeking mass into a paste and eat it'; they also  enjoy  the  'fat  maggoty  larvae  of  the  caribou  fly  served  raw.  .  deer droppings,  munched  like  berries  ...  and  marrow  more  than  a  year  old, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a href="#calibre_link-1">swarming with maggots' "5</a></p>

<p class="calibre1">Other  than  such  delicacies,  foragers  developed  little  surplus  food.  As anthropologist  Gregg  notes,  "mobile  populations  generally  do  not  store foodstuffs against seasonal or unexpected lows in resource availability." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  foragers  had  little  to  steal.  A  division  of  labor  that included specialization to employ violence was insupportable in settings where  surplus  food  could  not  be  stored.  The  logic  of  the  hunt  also dictated  that  violence  among  hunting-and-foraging  bands  could  never 72</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-74"></a>rise  above  a  small  scale  because  the  groups  themselves  had  to  remain tiny. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  small  scale  of  foraging  bands  was  advantageous  in  another  way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Members  of  such  small  groups  would  have  known  one  another intimately, a factor that made them more effective in working together. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Decision-making becomes more difficult as numbers 5 Ibid. </p>

<p class="calibre1">45</p>

<p class="calibre1">rise, because incentive traps proliferate. You need only think how hard it is  to  get  a  dozen  people  organized  to  go  out  to  dinner.  Imagine  how hopeless would have been the task of organizing hundreds or thousands of persons to traipse around on a moveable feast. Lacking any sustained and  separate  political  organization  or  bureaucracy  required  by specialization  for  war,  hunting-and-gathering  bands  had  to  depend  on persuasion and consensus-principles that work best among small groups with relatively easygoing attitudes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Whether hunting-and-gathering bands were easygoing is open to debate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sir Henry Maine refers to "the universal belligerency of primitive man." </p>

<p class="calibre1">In his words, "It is not peace which is natural and primitive but war." 6</p>

<p class="calibre1">His view has been underlined by the work of evolutionary biologists. R. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paul  Shaw  and  Yuwa  Wong  comment:  "[T]here  are  strong  indications that many of the injuries apparent in remains of Australopithecus, Homo erectus, and Homo sapiens of the European fourth and pre-fourth glacial periods  resulted  from  combat."  7  But  others  doubt  this.  Experts  like Stephen Boyden argue that primitive groups were usually not warlike or prone  to  violence.  Social  conventions  developed  to  reduce  internal tensions and facilitate the sharing of the hunt. Especially in areas where humans preyed on larger game, which was difficult for a single hunter to fell, religious and social doctrines emerged to facilitate the redistribution of any game that was taken with the whole group. The first priority of sharing  of  caloric  resources  was  with  other  hunters.  Necessity,  rather than  sentiment,  was  the  spur.  The  first  claim  on  the  resources  was exercised by the most economically competent and militarily strong, not by the sick and the weak. Undoubtedly, a major influence informing this priority was the fact that hunters in the prime of life were also militarily the  most  potent  members  of  the  small  band.  By  assuring  them  a  first 73</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-75"></a>claim  on  the  hunt,  the  group  minimized  potentially  lethal  internal squabbling. </p>

<p class="calibre1">So  long  as  population  densities  remained  low,  the  foragers'  gods  were not militant gods but embodiments of natural forces or the animals they hunted.  The  scantiness  of  capital  and  open  frontiers  made  war  in  most cases  unnecessary.  There  were  few  neighbors  outside  one's  own  small family or clan to pose threats. Because foragers tended to roam in search of  food,  personal  possessions  beyond  a  bare  minimum  became  an encumbrance. Those with few possessions necessarily experienced little property crime. When conflicts arose, the contending parties were often content to walk away because they had little invested in any given locale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Escape was an easy solution to personal feuds or exorbitant demands of other kinds. This does not mean that early humans were peaceful. They may  have  been  violent  and  unpleasant  to  a  degree  we  can  scarcely imagine.  But  if  they  employed  violence,  it  was  mostly  for  personal reasons or, what may be worse, for sport. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  livelihoods  of  hunter-gatherers  depended  upon  their  functioning  in small bands that allowed little or no scope for a division of labor other than along gender lines. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  had  no  organized  government,  usually  no  permanent  settlements, and  no  possibility  for  accumulating  wealth.  Even  such  basic  building blocks  of  civilization  as  a  written  language  were  unknown  in  the primeval economy. Without a written language there could be no formal records and no history. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Overkill</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The dynamic of foraging created very different incentives to work than those to which we have become accustomed since the advent of farming. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  capital  requirements  for  life  as  a  forager  were  minimal.  A  few primitive  tools  and  weapons  sufficed.  There  was  no  outlet  for investment,  not  even  private  property  in  land,  except  occasionally  in quarries where flint or soapstone was mined. 8 As anthropologist Susan Alling Gregg wrote in  <i class="calibre3">Foragers and Farmers</i>, "Ownership of and access 74</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-76"></a>to resources was "held in common by the group." 9 With rare exceptions, such  as  fishers  living  on  the  shores  of  lakes,  foragers  usually  had  no fixed place of abode. Having no permanent homes, they had little need to work hard to acquire property or maintain it. They had no mortgage or taxes to pay, no furniture to buy. Their few consumer goods were animal skins,  and  personal  adornments  made  by  members  of  the  group themselves. There was little incentive to acquire or accumulate anything that might have passed for money because there was little to buy. Under such conditions, savings for the foragers could have been no more than a rudimentary concept. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With  no  reason  to  earn  and  almost  no  division  of  labor,  the  concept  of hard work as a virtue must have been foreign to hunting-and-gathering groups.  Except  during  periods  of  unusual  hardship,  when  protracted effort  was  required  to  find  something  to  eat,  little  work  was  done because  little  was  needed.  There  was  literally  nothing  to  be  gained  by working  beyond  the  bare  minimum  required  for  survival.  For  the members of the typical hunting-and-gathering band, that meant working only about eight to fifteen hours a week. Because a hunter's labor did not augment  the  food  supply  but  could  only  reduce  it,  one  who  heroically labored overtime to kill more animals or pick more fruit than could be eaten before it spoiled contributed nothing to prosperity. To the contrary, overkill reduced the prospects of finding food in the future, and thus had a  detrimental  impact  on  the  wellbeing  of  the  group.  That  is  why  some foragers, such as Eskimos, punished or ostracized members of the band who engaged in overkill. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  example  of  the  Eskimos  punishing  overkill  is  particularly  telling, because  they,  far  more  than  others,  might  well  have  been  able  to  store meat by freezing it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Further, it would have been feasible to provide at least some storage for oils rendered from large marine animals. The fact that foragers generally chose not to do so reflects their far more passive interactions with nature. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It may also indicate the degree to which cognition and mental processes are biased by culture. Constraints on learning and behavior in complex environments  make  adoption  of  some  strategies  far  more  difficult  than would otherwise appear. As R. Paul Shaw and Yuwa Wong have written, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Because niches differ in many respects, so, too, do biases in learning." </p>

<p class="calibre1">75</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-77"></a>Seen in this perspective, the advent of agriculture entailed more than a change in diet; it also launched a great revolution in the organization of economic  life  and  culture  as  well  as  a  transformation  of  the  logic  of violence.  Farming  created  large-scale  capital  assets  in  land  and sometimes  in  irrigation  systems.  The  crops  and  domesticated  animals farmers raised were valuable assets. They could be stored, hoarded, and stolen. Because crops had to be tended over the entire growing season, from planting through harvest, 47</p>

<p class="calibre1">migration  away  from  threats  became  less  attractive,  especially  in  arid regions  where  opportunities  to  grow  crops  were  confined  to  the  small areas  of  the  land  with  dependable  water  supplies.  As  escape  became more  difficult,  opportunities  for  organized  shakedowns  and  plunder increased. Farmers were subject to raids at harvest time, which gradually raised the scale of warfare. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This tended to increase the size of societies because contests of violence more often than not were won by the larger group. As competition over land  and  control  of  its  output  became  more  intense,  societies  became more stationary. A division of labor became more apparent. Employment and  slavery  arose  for  the  first  time.  Farmers  and  herders  specialized  in producing  food.  Potters  produced  containers  in  which  food  was  stored. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Priests prayed for rain and bountiful harvests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Specialists  in  violence,  the  forefathers  of  government,  increasingly devoted themselves to plunder and protection from plunder. Along with the priests, they became the first wealthy persons in history. In the early stages of agricultural societies, these warriors came to control a portion of the annual crop as a price of protection. In places where threats were minimal,  yeoman  farmers  were  sometimes  able  to  retain  a  relatively large  degree  of  autonomy.  But  as  population  densities  rose,  and competition  over  food  intensified,  especially  in  regions  around  deserts where productive land was at a premium, the warrior group could take a large fraction of total output. These warriors founded the first states with the proceeds of this rake-off, which reached as high as 25 percent of the grain  crop  and  one-half  the  increase  in  herds  of  domesticated  animals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Farming,  therefore,  dramatically  increased  the  importance  of  coercion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The surge in resources capable of being plundered led to a large surge in plunder. </p>

<p class="calibre1">76</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-78"></a>It took millennia for the full logic of the Agricultural Revolution to play itself out. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For a long while, sparse populations of farmers in temperate regions may have  lived  much  as  their  foraging  forebears  had  done.  Where  land  and rainfall  were  ample,  farmers  harvested  crops  on  a  small  scale  without much  violent  interference.  But  as  populations  rose  over  a  period  of several  thousand  years,  farmers  even  in  thinly  settled  regions  became subject  to  erratic  plunder  that  sometimes  must  have  left  them  with insufficient seed to replant the next year's crop. Competitive plundering, or  anarchy,  was  a  possibility  at  one  extreme,  as  well  as  unprotected communities living without any specialized organization to monopolize violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  time  passed,  the  logic  of  violence  inherent  in  agriculture  imposed itself over an ever-wider terrain. The regions where farming and herding could  continue  without  the  predations  of  government  receded  to  a  few truly remote areas. The Kafir regions of Afghanistan, to cite an extreme example, resisted the imposition of government until the last decade of the nineteenth century. But in so doing, they were transformed centuries earlier into a quite militant society, organized along kinship lines. Such arrangements were not capable of mustering force on a large scale. Until the British brought modern weapons to the region, the Kafirs remained independent  in  their  remote  Bashgal  and  Waigal  valleys  because  their redoubts  were  protected  by  features  topography,  high  mountains,  and deserts that stood between them and conquerors from thc outside.'2</p>

<p class="calibre1">Over time, the basic logic of the Agricultural Revolution impressed itself on  the  societies  where  farming  took  hold.  Farming  sharply  raised  the scope at which human 48</p>

<p class="calibre1">communities could form. Beginning about ten thousand years ago, cities began  to  emerge.  Although  tiny  by  today's  standards,  they  were  the centers of the first 'civilizations," a word derived from civit which means</p>

<p class="calibre1">"citizenship" or "inhabitants of a city" in Latin. Because farming created assets to plunder and to protect, it also created a requirem for inventory accounting.  You  cannot  tax  unless  you  can  compile  records  and  issue receipts.  The  symbols  employed  in  the  accountant's  ledger  became  the 77</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-79"></a>rudiments  of  written  language,  an  innovation  that  had  never  existed among hunters and gatherers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Farming  also  extended  the  horizon  over  which  humans  had  to  solve problems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hunting  bands  lived  within  an  immediate  time  horizon.  They  seldom undertook  projects  that  lasted  more  than  a  few  days.  But  planting  and harvesting a crop took months. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pursuing projects of a longer time frame farmers to train their attentions on the stars. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Detailed astronomical observations were a precondition for drawing up almanacs  and  calendars  to  serve  as  guides  on  when  to  best  plant  and reap. With the advent of farming, hunters horizons expanded. </p>

<p class="calibre1">78</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-80"></a><b class="calibre4">PROPERTY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  move  to  a  settled  agricultural  society  resulted  in  the  emergence private  property.  Obviously,  no  one  would  be  content  to  toil  through whole  growing  season  to  produce  a  crop  just  to  see  someone  else  war along  and  harvest  what  he  produced.  The  idea  of  property  emerged  a' </p>

<p class="calibre1">inevitable  consequence  of  farming.  But  the  clarity  of  private  property concept  was  attenuated  by  the  logic  of  violence  that  also  accompanied introduction  of  farming.  The  emergence  of  property  was  confused  by fact that the megapolitical power of individuals was no longer as equal had  been  in  foraging  societies,  where  every  healthy  adult  male  was  a hunter as well armed as anyone else. Farming gave rise to specialization in  violence.  Precisely  because  it  created  something  to  steal,  farming made  investment  in  better  weaponry  profitable.  The  result  was  theft, much of it highly organized. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  powerful  were  now  able  to  organize  a  new  form  of  predation:  a monopoly  of  violence,  or  government.  This  sharply  differentiated societies, creating quite different circumstances for those who benefited from plunder, and the mass of poor who tilled the fields. The few who controlled military power could now become rich, along with others who found favor with them. The god-kings and their allies, the various lesser, local  potentates  who  ruled  the  first  Near  Eastern  states,  enjoyed  much more  nearly  modern  forms  of  property  than  the  great  mass  who  toiled beneath them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, it is anachronistic to think of a distinction between private and public wealth in the early agricultural societies. The ruling god-king had the full resources of the state at his disposal in a way that could hardly be distinguished  from  ownership  of  a  sprawling  estate.  Much  as  in  the feudal  period  of  European  history,  all  property  was  subject  to  the overlordship  of  higher  potentates.  Those  down  the  chain  of  hierarchy found their property subject to attenuation at the whim of the ruler. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet to say that the potentate was not restrained by law does not mean that he  could  afford  to  seize  anything  he  pleased.  Costs  and  rewards impinged upon the freedom 49</p>

<p class="calibre1">79</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-81"></a>of  the  pharaoh  as  much  as  they  do  today  upon  the  prime  minister  of Canada. And the pharaoh was much more constrained than contemporary leaders  by  the  difficulties  of  transport  and  communication.  Simply hauling  loot  from  one  spot  to  the  next,  especially  when  loot  was measured  mainly  in  the  form  of  agricultural  produce,  involved  a  lot  of loss  from  spoilage  and  theft.  The  proliferation  of  officials  to  check  on one  another  reduced  the  loss  due  to  pilfering  but  increased  the  total overhead costs the pharaoh had to bear. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Decentralized  authority,  which  optimized  output  under  some circumstances,  also  gave  rise  to  stronger  local  powers  who  sometimes blossomed  into  full-fledged  challengers  for  dynastic  control.  Even Oriental despots were by no means free to do as they pleased. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They had no choice but to recognize the balance of raw power as they found it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Although  everyone,  including  the  rich,  was  subject  to  arbitrary expropriation, some were able to accumulate property of their own. Then as now, the state devoted much of its income to public works. Projects such  irrigation  systems,  religious  monuments,  and  crypts  for  the  kings provided opportunities for architects and artisans to earn income. Some well-situated  individuals  were  able  to  accumulate  considerable  private property. In fact, a large portion of the surviving cuneiform tablets from Sumer, an early Mesopotamian civilization, record various acts of trade, most of which involve the transfer of property titles. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There was private property in the early agricultural societies, but seldom at the bottom of the social pyramid. The overwhelming majority of the population were peasants who were too poor to accumulate much wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  with  a  few  exceptions,  most  peasants,  up  until  modern  times, were  so  poor  that  they  stood  in  constant  danger  of  perishing  from starvation  any  time  that  a  drought  or  a  flood  or  an  infestation  reduced crop yields. Hence the peasants were obliged to organize their affairs in a way  that  minimized  the  downside  risks  in  bad  years.  Across  the  broad and  impoverished  stratum  of  society,  a  more  primitive  organization  of property obtained. It increased the chance of survival at the expense of foreclosing the greater part of the opportunity to accumulate capital and rise in the economic system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">80</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-82"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Peasant Insurance</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The form that this bargain took was the adoption of what anthropologists and  social  historians  describe  as  the  "closed  village."  Almost  every peasant  society  in  premodern  times  had,  as  its  main  form  of  economic organization, the "closed village." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike  more  modern  forms  of  economic  organization,  in  which individuals tend to deal with many buyers and sellers in an open market, the  households  of  the  closed  village  joined  together  to  operate  like  an informal corporation, or a large family, not in an open marketplace but in a closed system where all the economic transactions of the village tended to  be  struck  with  a  single  monopolist-the  local  landlord,  or  his  agents among the village chiefs. The village as a whole would contract with the landlord, usually for payment in kind, for a high proportion of the crop, rather  than  a  fixed  rent.  The  proportional  rent  meant  that  the  landlord absorbed  part  of  the  downside  risk  of  a  bad  harvest.  Of  course,  the landlord also took the greater part of the potential profit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Landlords also typically provided seed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">50</p>

<p class="calibre1">This convention also minimized the danger of starvation. It required that the landlord, rather than the peasant, save a disproportionate share of his part of the harvest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  agricultural  yields  were  appallingly  low  in  many  areas  in  the past, as many as two seeds had to be planted for every three harvested. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, a bad harvest would mean mass starvation. The peasants  rationally  preferred  an  arrangement  which  would  require  the landlord to invest in their survival. At the cost of buying at monopolized prices, selling cheaply, and providing the landlord with in-kind labor, the peasants  increased  their  chances  of  survival.  A  similar  impulse  led  the typical  peasant  in  a  closed  village  economy  to  forgo  the  security  of freehold property ownership. By putting themselves at the mercy of the village  headman,  a  peasant  family  improved  its  chances  of  benefiting from  the  regular  redistribution  of  fields.  Not  infrequently,  the  headman would take the best fields for himself and his favorites. But that was a 81</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-83"></a>risk that peasants had to tolerate in order to enjoy the survival insurance that confused village ownership of fields provided. At times when crop yields were miserably low, a difference in growing conditions of fields a hundred  yards  apart  could  make  the  difference  between  starvation  and survival. Peasants frequently opted for the arrangement that lowered the downside  risk,  even  at  the  cost  of  forgoing  any  hope  of  increased prosperity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In general, risk-averse behavior has been common among all groups that operated along the margins of survival. The sheer challenge of survival in premodern societies always constrained the behavior of the poor. An interesting  feature  of  this  risk  aversion,  explored  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Great</i> <i class="calibre3">Reckoning</i>,  is  that  it  reduced  the  range  of  peaceful  economic  behavior that  individuals  were  socially  permitted  to  adopt.  Taboos  and  social constraints limited experimentation and innovative behavior, even at the obvious  cost  of  forgoing  potentially  advantageous  improvements  in settled ways of doing things.'3 This was a rational reflection of the fact that experimentation increases the variability of results. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Greater  variability  means  not  only  potentially  greater  gains  but  more ominously  for  those  at  the  very  margin  of  survival-potentially  ruinous losses. A great part of the cultural energy of poor farming societies has always been devoted to suppressing experimentation. This repression, in effect, was their substitute for insurance policies. If they had insurance, or sufficient savings to self-insure their experiments, such strong social taboos would not be needed to help ensure survival. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Cultures  are  not  matters  of  taste  but  systems  of  adaptation  to  specific circumstances  that  may  prove  irrelevant  or  even  counterproductive  in other settings. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Humans live in a wide variety of habitats. The wide number of potential niches  in  which  we  live  require  variations  in  behavior  that  are  too complex to be informed by instinct. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  behavior  is  culturally  programmed.  For  the  vast  majority  in many  agricultural  societies,  culture  programmed  them  for  survival,  but little  more  than  survival  in  an  environment  where  the  luxury  of participating in open markets was reserved to others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">82</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-84"></a>Personal ability and personal choice-individual "pursuit of happiness," in the modern sense-were suppressed by taboos and social restrictions that have always been most emphatic among the poor. Such restrictions were superseded  only  with  great  difficulty  in  societies  with  limited productivity. When and where agricultural productivity was higher, such as in ancient Greece, minor megapolitical revolutions 51</p>

<p class="calibre1">occurred.  Property  took  more  modern  forms.  "Allod,"  or  freehold property, emerged. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lands  tended  to  rent  for  a  fixed  fee,  and  the  tenant  absorbed  the economic  risk  as  well  as  a  higher  portion  of  the  profit  if  the  crop  was good.  Higher  savings  allow  self-insurance  of  riskier  behavior.  Under such conditions, yeoman farmers could rise above the rank of peasantry and sometimes even accumulate independent wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  tendency  for  more  market-like  property  rights  and  relationships  to develop near the top of an economic hierarchy or, in rarer cases, across the whole economy, as societies emerged from poverty, is an important characteristic of social organization. It is equally important to note that the  most  common  organization  of  agricultural  society  historically  has been  essentially  feudal,  with  market  relations  at  the  top  and  the  closed village system at the bottom. The great mass of peasants were tied to the land  in  almost  all  premodern  agricultural  societies.  So  long  as agricultural  productivity  remained  low,  or  higher  productivity  was dependent upon access to centralized hydraulic systems, the freedom and property rights of individual farmers at the bottom remained minimal. In such  conditions,  feudal  forms  of  property  prevailed.  Land  was  held  by tenure  rather  than  through  freehold  title.  Typically,  rights  of  sale,  gift, and inheritance were restricted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Feudalism in its various forms was not only a response to ever-present risks of predatory violence. It also was a reaction to appallingly low rates of  productivity.  The  two  have  tended  to  go  hand  in  hand  in  farming societies. Each frequently contributed to the other. When public authority collapsed,  property  rights  and  prosperity  tended  to  recede  accordingly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Collapsing  productivity  also  tended  to  undermine  authority.  While  not every  drought  or  adverse  climatic  change  resulted  in  the  breakdown  of public authority, many did. </p>

<p class="calibre1">83</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-85"></a><b class="calibre4">THE FEUDAL REVOLUTION OF THE YEAR 1000</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  was  the  case  with  the  transformation  of  the  year  1000,  which launched  the  feudal  revolution.14  At  that  time,  megapolitical  and economic  conditions  differed  in  important  ways  from  those  we  have come to think of as characterizing the Middle Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the first few centuries after the fall of Rome, the economy of Western Europe withered. The Germanic kingdoms that took root in the territories of the former Roman Empire had assumed many functions of the Roman state, but at a much less ambitious level. Infrastructure more or less went untended.  As  the  centuries  passed,  bridges  and  aqueducts  fell  into disrepair and became unusable. Roman coinage was still employed, but it practically  disappeared  from  circulation.  Land  markets,  which  had thrived in Roman times, more or less dried up. Towns, which had been centers  of  Roman  administration,  virtually  vanished  along  with  the taxing power of the state. And so did almost every other accoutrement of civilization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The "Dark Ages" were so named for a reason. Literacy became so rare that  anyone  who  possessed  the  ability  to  read  and  write  could  expect immunity  from  prosecution  for  almost  any  crime,  including  murder. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Artistic, scientific, and engineering skills that had been highly developed in Roman times disappeared. From road building to the grafting of vines and fruit trees, Western Europe ceased employing many techniques that had once been well known and practiced to a high standard. Even so 52</p>

<p class="calibre1">ancient  a  device  as  the  potter's  wheel  disappeared  in  many  places. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mining  operations  contracted.  Metallurgy  receded.  Irrigation  works  in the Mediterranean region disintegrated through neglect.' 15 As historian Georges Duby observed, "At the end of the sixth century, Europe was a profoundly uncivilized place." 16 Although there was a brief renaissance of central authority under the rule of Charlemagne around the year 800, everything soon devolved again after his death. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  surprising  corollary  to  this  dreary  landscape  was  the  fact  that  the collapse of the Roman state probably raised the living standards of small farmers for several centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">84</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-86"></a>The Germanic kingdoms that dominated Western Europe during the Dark Ages  incorporated  some  of  the  relatively  easygoing  social  features common  to  their  ancestral  tribes,  such  as  the  legal  equality  of freeholders. As a consequence, small farmers in the Dark Ages were far freer  than  they  were  to  be  in  the  feudal  centuries.  By  that  we  can  also infer that they were more prosperous. As we analyzed above in exploring the  logic  of  property  forms  under  different  conditions  of  productivity, freehold  property  has  historically  gone  hand  in  hand  with  the  relative prosperity  of  small  farmers.  The  closed-village  and  feudal  forms  of property tended to emerge where the capacity of small farmers to make a living was more doubtful. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the virtual collapse of commerce during the Dark Ages cost small farmers the benefits of trade and advantages of wider markets. The demise of the towns undermined the cash economy, but it also meant the rural  population  was  no  longer  called  upon  to  support  the  crushing burden of bureaucracy. As Guy Bois has written, the Roman town was a parasitic community, not a center of production: "In the Roman period, the dominant function of a city was of a political order. It lived primarily from the revenues draining into it from its surroundings by the agency of the  land  tax....  The  town,  in  effect,  produced  little  or  nothing  for  the benefit of the surrounding countryside." </p>

<p class="calibre1">17  The  collapse  of  Roman  authority  largely  freed  farmers  in  the countryside from taxes, which had sucked away "between one quarter to one third of the gross product of the land, without counting the various exactions suffered by small and middling landowners." </p>

<p class="calibre1">18  The  taxes  were  so  onerous,  sometimes  enforced  by  execution,  that desertion  of  property  by  owners  was  widespread.  The  barbarians mercifully allowed these taxes to lapse. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Agri Deserti</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  burdens  of  government  were  so  greatly  reduced  by  the  barbarian conquests  that  an  opening  was  created  for  the  poor  to  obtain  freehold property  and  keep  it.  Some  of  the  agri  deserti,  or  deserted  farms abandoned by owners fleeing predatory taxation in the final years of the Roman Empire, were brought back into production. Notwithstanding the 85</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-87"></a>rude  circumstances  of  the  time  and  the  fact  that  crop  yields  were ridiculously low by modern standards, the Dark Ages were a period of relative  prosperity  for  Europe's  smallholders.  In  fact,  they  were  in  a stronger position than they would be again until the modern era. For one thing,  fewer  hands  were  available  to  till  the  fertile  land,  large  tracts  of which had gone out of cultivation. Plagues, wars, and abandonment by owners 53</p>

<p class="calibre1">escaping  the  collapsing  Roman  Empire  had  significantly  depopulated areas previously under cultivation. Another advantage enjoyed by small farmers in the Dark Ages arose from the adoption in the sixth century of new  farming  technology:  the  heavy  plow,  often  mounted  on  wheels. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Used  in  tandem  with  an  improved  harness  that  allowed  peasants  to employ multiple oxen, the new technology made it much easier to clear forested land in Northern Europe.' 19</p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  such  conditions,  the  market  for  land  contracted  almost  to  the vanishing point. New land for farming could be had merely by clearing it and  sharing  part  of  each  new  parcel  with  the  appropriate  local authorities. This process, known as assarting, gave a comfortable outlet for  population  growth  for  centuries  after  Rome  fell.  Assarting  became particularly attractive in thinly populated northern regions after warmer temperatures in the eighth century made farming more productive. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  leaders  of  the  Germanic  tribes  who  conquered  former  Roman territories  had  established  themselves  as  large  landholders.  Most  of  the rest  of  the  population  farmed  small  plots-but  under  conditions  very different  from  those  that  came  later  under  feudalism.  Wealthier landowners, or masters represented about 7-10 percent of the population. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  appears  that  before  the  year  1000,  two-thirds  of  the  villagers  in  a typical  area  of  France  wen  freehold  landowners.21  They  owned  about half  of  all  the  land  in  cultivation.2  There  were  few  serfs.  Coloni,  or tenant  farmers,  amounted  to  no  more  than  5  percent  of  the  population. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Slavery persisted, but on a much smaller scale than in Roman times. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Germanic successor kingdoms to Rome were defended militarily by all free men who assembled to bear arms on the call of the king's local representative, the count. </p>

<p class="calibre1">86</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-88"></a>Even  "small  and  middling  proprietors"  were  expected  to  club  together and send one of their number to fight with the infantry. 22 In the Edict of Pitres,  Charles  the  Bald  ordered  all  those  who  could  afford  to  do  so  to muster  for  battle  on  horseback.  Pope  Gregory  II;  had  attempted  to advance this military imperative a century earlier by banning the human consumption  of  horsemeat  in  732.  23  But  there  was  as  yet  little distinction  in  status  or  law  between  the  infantry  of  freeholders  and  the cavalry. All free men participated in local judicial assemblies and could petition  for  dispute  settlement  to  the  count,  an  office  that  had  existed since late Roman times. There was no nobility as such. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre3">A social phenomenon, new as a mass phenomenon, suddenly appeared</i> <i class="calibre3">on  the  horizons  in  the</i> <i class="calibre3">980s:  downward  social  mobility.  Its  first  victims</i> <i class="calibre3">were the small allod-holders." 24 </i> Guy Bois As the Dark Ages wore on, however, several things happened to destabilize the relationships that had preserved the independence of the yeoman farmers and freeholders in the Germanic kingdoms that inherited power after Rome's fall: 1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Populations gradually recovered, placing greater pressures on the use of land. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Over  several  centuries,  much  of  the  most  fertile  of  the  unclaimed  land was  brought  into  production,  particularly  growth  in  Northern  Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The increasing population of farmers relative to the supply of land made the labor of each farmer worth less. Most freehold titles were broken into ever  smaller  plots  through  inheritance.  During  the  Dark  Ages,  children tended to share equally in the estates of their parents. The fragmentation 54</p>

<p class="calibre1">of  holdings  at  a  time  of  rising  population  tended  to  place  land  at  a premium once again and led to the reemergence of active land markets by the mid-tenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  final  decades  of  the  tenth  century,  temperatures  suddenly  turned colder, with a devastating impact on farm output. Three successive crop failures led to severe famine from 982 to 984. Famine struck again after another crop failure in 994-95. Then, in 997, the problem of falling crop 87</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-89"></a>yields was compounded by a plague, which struck small family holdings with  particular  force  because  the  smallholders  lacked  the  resources  to replace  labor  supplied  by  lost  family  members.  These  clustered  crop failures  and  disasters  at  first  led  the  yeoman  farmers  to  sink  into  debt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When yields failed to recover they could not pay their mortgages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Power  relations  were  progressively  destabilized  by  the  growing importance of heavy cavalry. Medieval historian Frances Gies describes the transformation of the armored cavalryman into the medieval knight: Originally a personality of mediocre status raised above the peasant by his expensive horse and armor, the knight slowly improved his position in  society  until  he  became  part  of  the  nobility.  Although  knights remained  the  lowest  rank  of  the  upper  class,  knighthood  acquired  a unique cachet that made knighting an honor prized by the great nobility and even royalty. The cachet was primarily the product of the Church's policy  of  Christianizing  knighthood  by  sanctifying  the  ceremony  of knighting  and  by  sponsoring  a  code  of  behavior  known  as  chivalry,  a code  perhaps  violated  more  often  than  honored,  but  exercising incontestable influence on the thought and conduct of posterity. 26</p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  recounted  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>,  the  invention  of  the  stirrup gave the armed knight on horseback a formidable assault capability. He could now attack at full speed and not be thrown from the saddle by the impact  of  his  lance  striking  a  target.  The  military  value  of  the  heavy cavalry  was  further  enhanced  by  an  Asian  invention  that  penetrated through Western Europe in the tenth century; the nailed iron horseshoe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  further  improved  the  durability  of  the  horse  on  the  road.27  Also adding  to  the  improved  effectiveness  of  the  armed  knight  were  the contoured saddle, which made it easier to wield heavy weapons, the spur, and the curb bit, which enabled a rider to control the horse with one hand while  fighting.  28  Together,  these  apparently  minor  technological innovations  dramatically  devalued  the  military  importance  of  the smallholders,  who  could  not  afford  to  maintain  warhorses  and  arm themselves.  The  cheaper  of  the  horses  specially  bred  for  war,  the  large chargers  known  as  destriers,  were  worth  four  oxen  or  forty  sheep.  The more  expensive  warhorses  cost  ten  oxen  or  one  hundred  sheep.  Armor 88</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-90"></a>also cost a sum that no small holder could afford, equivalent to the price of sixty sheep.29</p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  the  colder  weather,  crop  failures,  famines,  and  plagues occurred  during  the  run-up  to  the  year  1000  also  played  a  role  in informing  behavior  Many  people  were  convinced  that  the  end  of  the world  or  the  Second  Coming  was  at  hand.  Devout  or  frightened landowners, large and small, gave their land to the Church in preparation for apocalypse. </p>

<p class="calibre1">55</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Only a Poor Man Sells Land" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The unsettled conditions of the late tenth century paved the way for the feudal  revolution.  Clustered  crop  failures  and  disasters  led  the  yeoman farmers to sink into debt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  crop  yields  failed  to  recover,  the  freeholders  faced  a  desperate situation.  Markets  always  place  the  greatest  pressures  on  the  weakest holders. Indeed, that is part of their virtue. They promote efficiency by removing  assets  from  weak  hands.  But  in  late-tenth-century  Europe, subsistence  farming  was  practically  the  only  occupation.  Families  who lost  their  land  lost  their  only  means  of  survival.  Faced  with  this unpalatable  prospect,  many  or  most  of  the  freehold  farmers  decided  to give away their fields during the feudal revolution. In the words of Guy Bois, "The only sure way for a peasant to hold on to the land he tilled was  to  concede  ownership  of  it  to  the  Church,  so  he  could  retain  its usufruct." 30 Others ceded some or all of their land to wealthier farmers in whom they had confidence, either friendly neighbors or relatives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These property transfers were made on the condition that the farmer, his family, and his descendants were to remain to work the fields. The poor farmers were also to enjoy the reciprocal support of the more substantial holders, now the "nobles" who were able to afford horse and armor, and thus  provide  protection  to  the  enlarged  estates.  Such  a  bargain  can  be seen  from  the  new  serf's  point  of  view  as  a  halfway  station  between 89</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-91"></a>continuing economic ownership and foreclosure. More often than not, it was a bargain he could not refuse. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Falling  productivity  not  only  placed  poor  farmers  in  a  desperate economic  dilemma;  it  also  instigated  an  upsurge  in  predatory  violence that undermined the security of property. Those without the resources to wrest a share of the available and inadequate supply of horses and fodder suddenly found that they and their property were no longer safe. To put their dilemma in contemporary terms, it was as if you were forced to arm yourself today with a new type of weapon, but the cost of doing so was $100,000. If you could not pay that price, you would be at the mercy of those who could. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Within  a  few  years,  the  capacity  of  the  king  and  the  courts  to  enforce order collapsed. 31 Anyone with armor and a horse could now become a law unto himself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The result was a late-tenth-century version of  <i class="calibre3">Blade Runner, </i> a melee of fighting  and  plunder  that  the  constituted  authorities  were  powerless  to stop. Looting and attacks by armed knights disrupted the countryside. It is by no means obvious, however, that all the victims of this pillage were the poor. To the contrary, the elderly, physically weaker, or ill-prepared among  the  larger  landholders  made  more  attractive  targets.  They  had more to steal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  not  a  coincidence  that  this  happened  at  the  very  moment  when colder  weather,  famine,  and  plague  were  placing  a  pinch  on  resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  megapolitical  conditions  conducive  to  the  breakdown  of  authority had been in place for some time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  potential  for  altering  the  power  relations  in  society  was  not realized, however, until a crisis was triggered. Crop failures and famines appear  to  have  done  just  that.  While  the  exact  sequence  of  events  is difficult to reconstruct, it appears that the looting was instigated, at least in  part,  by  desperate  conditions.  Once  the  violence  was  unleashed,  it became evident that no one could mobilize the force to stop it. The vast majority of 56</p>

<p class="calibre1">90</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-92"></a>poorly  armed  farmers  certainly  could  do  little.  Even  dozens  of  farmers on  foot  would  have  been  outmatched  by  a  single  armed  knight  on horseback.  The  freehold  farmers,  like  the  constituted  authorities,  the kings with their counts, were powerless to prevent local land from being seized by armed warriors. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"The Peace of God" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  these  desperate  conditions,  the  Church  helped  to  launch  feudalism through  its  efforts  to  negotiate  a  truce  in  the  violent  countryside. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Historian Guy Bois described the situation this way: "The impotence of the political authorities was such that the Church stood in for them in the attempt to restore order, in the movement known as 'The Peace of God.' </p>

<p class="calibre1">'Councils  of  Peace'  proclaimed  series  of  interdictions  which  were sanctioned by anathemas; vast 'assemblies of peace' received the oaths of the  warriors.  The  movement  originated  in  the  French  Midi  (Council  of Charroux in 989, Council of Narbonne in 990), then gradually spread..." </p>

<p class="calibre1">32</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  bargain  that  the  Church  struck  involved  acknowledgment  of  the overlordship  of  armed  knights  in  local  communities  in  exchange  for  a cessation or tempering of the violence and looting. Land titles inscribed after the surge of violence in the late tenth century suddenly bore the title</p>

<p class="calibre1">"nobilis"  or  "miles"  as  an  indication  of  lordship.  The  nobility  as  a separate  estate  was  created  by  the  feudal  revolution.  Property transactions recorded to the same individuals only a few years earlier had listed no such distinction.33</p>

<p class="calibre1">Given  falling  productivity  and  the  economic  insecurity  of  the smallholders,  the  megapolitical  power  of  the  armed  knights  led inevitably to property holdings by feudal tenure. By the end of the first quarter of the eleventh century, yeoman farmers had largely disappeared. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their freeholdings had shrunk to a fraction of their previous extent and were  now  being  worked  just  part-time.  The  small  farmers  or  their descendants  were  serfs  who  spent  most  of  their  time  laboring  on  the estates of feudal lords, lay and ecclesiastical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  breakdown  of  order  that  accompanied  the  feudal  revolution  led  to adjustments in behavior which reinforced feudalism. Among them was a 91</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-93"></a>surge in castle building. Castles had first appeared in northwest Europe as primitive wooden structures in the wake of Viking raids in the ninth century.  Originally  command  centers  for  Carolingian  officials,  they became hereditary possessions after the feudal revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  early  redoubts  were  far  more  primitive  than  they  would  later become,  but  they  were  nonetheless  difficult  to  attack.  Once  erected, castles were razed only with the greatest effort. As they began to dot the countryside,  the  castles  made  it  ever  more  implausible  that  the  king  or his counts could effectively challenge the local supremacy of the lords. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Contributions of the Church to Productivity</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">57</p>

<p class="calibre1">Feudalism  was  the  response  of  agricultural  society  to  the  collapse  of order at a time of low productivity. During the early stages of feudalism, the  Church  played  an  important  and  economically  productive  role. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Among the Church's contributions: 1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In an environment where military power was decentralized, the Church was  uniquely  placed  to  maintain  peace  and  develop  rules  of  order  that transcended fragmented, local sovereignties. This is a job that no secular power was positioned to do. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The observations of the great religious authority A. R. Radcliffe-Brown are  directly  relevant  here.  He  pointed  out  that  "the  social  function  of  a religion is independent of its truth or falsity." Even those that are "absurd and repulsive, such as those of some savage tribes, may be important and effective  parts  of  the  social  machinery."34  This  was  certainly  the  case with the Church in the early stages of feudalism. It helped create rules, as only  a  religion  could,  that  enabled  people  to  overcome  incentive  traps and behavioral dilemmas. Some of these were moral dilemmas common to  all  human  life.  But  others  were  local  dilemmas,  unique  to  the prevailing megapolitical conditions. The medieval Church had a special role to play in restoring order in the countryside in the final years of the tenth  century.  By  providing  religious  and  ceremonial  support  to  local authorities,  the  Church  lowered  the  costs  of  establishing  at  least  weak local monopolies of violence. By helping to establish order in this way, 92</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-94"></a>the  Church  contributed  to  the  conditions  that  ultimately  led  to  more stable configurations of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church  continued  to  play  a  role  for  a  long  time  thereafter  in tempering the private wars and excesses of violence that otherwise could not  be  contained  by  civil  authorities.  The  relative  importance  of  the Church as opposed to secular authorities is reflected in the fact that by the  eleventh  century,  the  main  administrative  division  of  authority  in most  of  Western  Europe  came  to  be  the  parish,  rather  than  the  old divisions of civil authority, the ager and pagus (town) that had persisted from Roman times through the Dark Ages.35</p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church  was  the  main  source  for  preserving  and  transmitting technical knowledge and information. The Church sponsored universities and provided the minimal education that medieval society enjoyed. The Church  also  provided  a  mechanism  for  reproducing  books  and manuscripts,  including  almost  all  contemporary  information  about farming  and  husbandry.  The  scriptoria  of  the  Benedictine  monasteries can be understood as an alternate technology to printing presses, which did not yet exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Costly  and  inefficient  as  the  scriptoria  were,  they  were  practically  the only  mechanism  for  reproducing  and  preserving  written  knowledge  in the feudal period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Partly  because  its  farm  managers  were  literate,  the  Church  did  a  great deal to help improve the productivity of European farming, especially in the early stages of feudalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Before the thirteenth century the farm managers of lay lords were almost all illiterates who kept records through an elaborate set of marks. Shrewd farmers though they may have been, they were in no position to benefit from any improvement in production methods that they could not invent themselves  or  see  with  their  own  eyes.  The  Church  was  therefore essential to improving the quality of grains, fruits, and breeding stock. </p>

<p class="calibre1">93</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-95"></a>Because  of  its  extensive  holdings  spread  over  the  entire  European continent, the Church could send the most productive seed and breeding stock to areas where output lagged. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  demand  for  sacramental  wine  in  Northern  Europe  led  monks  to experiment with 58</p>

<p class="calibre1">hardier  varieties  of  grape  that  could  survive  in  colder  climates.  The Church  also  helped  raise  the  productivity  of  medieval  farming  in  other ways.  Many  of  the  uneconomically  small  plots  donated  to  the  Church during  the  feudal  revolution  were  reconfigured  to  make  them  easier  to farm.  The  Church  also  provided  ancillary  services  required  by  small farming communities. In many areas, Church-owned mills ground grain into flour. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church  undertook  many  functions  that  are  today  absorbed  by government, including the provision of public infrastructure. This is part of  the  way  that  the  Church  helped  overcome  what  economists  call</p>

<p class="calibre1">"public  goods  dilemmas"  in  an  era  of  fragmented  authority.  Specific religious  orders  of  the  early-medieval  Church  devoted  themselves  to applied engineering tasks, like opening roads, rebuilding fallen bridges, and repairing dilapidated Roman aqueducts They also cleared land, built dams, and drained swamps. A new monastic order, the Carthusians, dug the first "artesian" well in Artois, France. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Using percussion drilling, they dug a small hole deep enough to create a well  that  needed  no  pump.36  The  Cistercian  Order  undertook  to  build and  maintain  precarious  seawalls  and  dikes  in  the  Low  Countries  of Europe. Farmers deeded land to Cistercian monasteries and then leased it back,  while  the  monks  undertook  full  responsibility  for  upkeep  and repairs.  Cistercians  also  took  the  lead  in  developing  water-powered machines,  which  were  adopted  to  such  widespread  uses  as  "pounding, lifting,  grinding,  and  pressing."37  The  monastery  of  Clairvaux  dug  a two-mile-long canal from the River Aube.3x The Church also intervened to  build  new  roads  and  bridges  where  population  centers  had  shifted outside  the  range  of  the  old  Roman  garrison  roads.  Bishops  granted indulgences to local lords who would build or repair river crossings and 94</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-96"></a>maintain  hospices  for  travelers.  An  order  of  monks  established  by  St. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Benezet, the Freres Pontifes, or "Brothers of the Bridge," built several of the  longest  bridges  then  existing,  including  the  Pont  d'Avignon,  a massive twenty-arch structure over the Rhone with a combination chapel and  tollbooth  at  one  end.  Even  London  Bridge,  which  stood  until  the nineteenth century, was constructed by a chaplain and financed in part by a contribution of 1,000 marks from the papal legate.39</p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church  also  helped  incubate  a  more  complex  market.  Cathedral construction, for example, differs in kind from public infrastructure, like bridges and aqueducts. In principle, at least, Church structures were used only for religious services and not as thoroughfares for commerce. Yet it should  not  be  forgotten  that  construction  of  churches  and  cathedrals helped  create  and  deepen  markets  for  many  artisanal  and  engineering skills. In the same way that military spending of the nationstate during the  Cold  War  unintentionally  helped  incubate  the  Internet,  so  the building  of  medieval  cathedrals  led  to  spin-offs  of  other  kinds,  the incubation  of  commerce.  The  Church  was  a  principal  customer  of  the building trades and artisans. Church purchases of silver for communion services, candelabra, and artworks to decorate churches helped to create a market for luxury goods that otherwise would not have existed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  many  ways,  the  Church  helped  to  temper  the  ferocity  of  violence unleashed  by  armed  knights  during  and  after  the  "feudal  revolution." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Especially  in  the  early  centuries  of  feudalism,  the  Church  contributed significantly  to  improving  the  productivity  of  the  farming  economy.  It was an essential institution, well fitted to the needs of agrarian society at the close of the Dark Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">59</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Vulnerability to Violence</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In "thirty or forty years of violent disturbances, the feudal revolution of the  year  1000,"  40  like  the  fall  of  Rome  five  centuries  earlier,  was  a unique  event,  caused  by  a  complex  interplay  of  influences.  Yet  in  one respect, the triumph of  <i class="calibre3">mali ham ines</i> (wicked men) and the oppressions 95</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-97"></a>they  wrought  perfectly  reflect  the  essential  vulnerability  of  agricultural society to violence. In contrast to the foraging phase of human existence, farming  introduced  a  quantum  leap  in  organized  violence  and oppression. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From the very earliest, this was reflected in the more militant cultures of farming peoples. The gods of the early agricultural societies were gods of rainfall and flooding, whose functions reflected the preoccupations of those  societies  with  factors  that  determined  crop  yields.  The  sender  of rain or water was also often the god of war, invoked by the earliest kings, who  were,  above  all  else,  warlords.41  The  close  connection  between farming and warfare was reflected in the religious imagination of people whose  lives  were  transformed  by  the  innovations  of  the  agricultural revolution.  The  expulsion  from  the  Garden  of  Eden  can  be  seen  as  a figurative  account  of  the  transformation  of  society  from  foraging  to farming, from a free life with food picked from nature's bounty with little work to a life of hard labor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">96</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-98"></a><b class="calibre4">PARADISE LOST</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Farming set humanity on an entirely new course. The first farmers truly planted  the  seeds  of  civilization.  From  their  toil  came  cities,  armies, arithmetic,  astronomy,  dungeons,  wine  and  whiskey,  the  written  word, kings, slavery, and war. Yet notwithstanding all the drama that farming was to add to life, the shift away from the primeval economy appears to have been roundly unpopular from its earliest days. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Witness  the  account  preserved  in  the  Book  of  Genesis,  which  tells  the story of the expulsion from paradise. The biblical parable of the Garden Of Eden is a fond recollection of the life of ease enjoyed by the forager in the wilderness. Scholars indicate that the word "Eden" appears to be derived from a Sumerian word for "wilderness."42</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  transition  from  a  free  and  sparsely  settled  life  in  the  wild  to  a sedentary life in a farming village was a matter of deep regret, expressed not only in the Bible but also in humankind's continuing grudge against getting up in the morning and going to work. As Stephen Boyden wrote in  <i class="calibre3">Western Civilization in Biological Perspective</i>, the new way of living that  accompanied  farming  was  "evodeviant."43  Prior  to  the  advent  of farming, thousands of human generations lived as Adam did in Eden, at the  invitation  of  his  Maker:  "Of  every  tree  of  the  garden  thou  mayest freely eat." Hunters and gatherers had no crops to tend, no herd to watch, no  taxes  to  pay.  Like  hoboes,  foragers  drifted  where  they  pleased, worked little, and answered to no one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With farming, a new way of life began, and on altogether more pressing terms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the 60</p>

<p class="calibre1">field;  In  the  sweat  of  thy  face  shalt  thou  eat  bread."  Farming  was  hard work. The memory of life before farming was that of paradise lost. </p>

<p class="calibre1">More  than  they  could  have  imagined,  farmers  created  new  conditions that drastically altered the logic of violence. It is not a coincidence that 97</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-99"></a>the  Book  of  Genesis  makes  Cain,  the  first  murderer,  "a  tiller  of  the ground." Indeed, it is part of the uncanny prophetic power of the Bible that  its  story  was  entrusted  to  shepherds  who  readily  understood  how farming gave leverage to violence. In a few verses the biblical account encapsulates logic that took thousands of years to play out. Farming was an  incubator  of  disputes.  Farming  created  stationary  capital  on  an extensive  scale,  raising  the  payoff  from  violence  and  dramatically increasing the challenge of protecting assets. Farming made both crime and government paying propositions for the first time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">ARTHUR C. CLARKE</p>

<p class="calibre1">To speak of the coming death of politics is bound to seem ridiculous or optimistic,  depending  on  your  disposition.  Yet  that  is  what  the Information Revolution is likely to bring. For readers reared in a century saturated in politics, the idea that life could proceed without it may seem fanciful,  the  equivalent  to  claiming  that  one  could  live  merely  by absorbing nutrients from the air. Yet politics in the modern sense, as the preoccupation with controlling and rationalizing the power of the state, is mostly a modern invention. We believe it will end with the modern world just  as  the  tangle  of  feudal  duties  and  obligations  that  engrossed  the attentions  of  people  in  the  Middle  Ages  ended  with  the  Middle  Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">During  the  feudal  period,  as  historian  Martin  van  Creveld  points  out, </p>

<p class="calibre1">The thought that politics, as we now know it, did not exist prior to the modern period may seem surprising, especially given that Aristotle had written an essay of that title in the days of Alexander the Great. But look closely.  Words  used  in  ancient  texts  are  not  necessarily  contemporary concepts. Aristotle also wrote an essay entitled Sophistical Refutations, a term about as meaningless today as Politics was in the Middle Ages. The word simply was not in use. Its first known appearance in English dates to 1529. Even then, "politics" appears to have been a pejorative, derived from an Old French word, politique, used to describe "opportunists and temporizers."4</p>

<p class="calibre1">99</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-101"></a>It took almost two thousand years for Aristotle's latent concept to emerge with the meaning we now know. Why? Before the modern world could put Aristotle's word to a meaningful use, megapolitical conditions were required that dramatically raised the returns to violence. The Gunpowder Revolution, which we analyzed in  <i class="calibre3">The Great</i> 62</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Reckoning</i>, did just that. It raised the returns to violence far above what they had ever been. This made the question of who controlled the state more important than it had ever been. Logically and inevitably, politics emerged  from  the  struggle  to  control  the  sharply  increased  spoils  of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Politics began five centuries ago with the early stages of industrialism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now it is dying. A widespread revulsion against politics and politicians is sweeping the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You see it in news and speculation on the hidden details of Whitewater, and  the  poorly  disguised  murder  of  Vincent  Foster.  You  see  it  in numerous  other  scandals  touching  President  Bill  Clinton.  You  see  in  it reports  of  embezzlement  by  leading  congressmen  from  the  House  Post Office.  You  see  it  in  scandals  leading  to  resignations  in  John  Major's circle,  and  similar  scandals  in  France,  reaching  two  recent  prime ministers, Eduard Balladur and Alain Juppe. Even larger scandals have been revealed in Italy, where seven-time prime minister Giuho Andreotti was brought to the dock to stand trail on charges that included links to the  Mafia  and  ordering  the  murder  of  Mino  Pecorelli,  an  investigative journalist.  Still  other  scandals  have  tarnished  the  reputation  of  Spanish prime  minister  Filipe  Gonzales.  Corruption  allegations  cost  four Japanese  prime  ministers  their  jobs  in  the  first  five  years  of  the  1990s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Canada's Justice Department alleged in a letter to Swiss authorities that former  prime  minister  Brian  Mulroney  had  received  kickbacks  on  a C$l.8  billion  sale  of  Airbus  planes  to  Air  Canada.5  Willy  Claes,  the secretary-general  of  NATO,  was  forced  to  resign  under  a  cloud  of corruption  allegations.  Even  in  Sweden,  Mona  Sahlm,  a  deputy  prime minister and presumptive prime minister, was forced to resign in the face of allegations that she used government credit cards to purchase  diapers  and  other  household  goods.  Almost  everywhere  you 100</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-102"></a>turn  in  countries  with  mature  welfare  states  once  thought  of  as  well governed, people hate their political leaders. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Disdain as a Leading Indicator</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Moral  outrage  against  corrupt  leaders  is  not  an  isolated  historical phenomenon  but  a  common  precursor  of  change.  It  happens  again  and again  whenever  one  era  gives  way  to  another.  Whenever  technological change  has  divorced  the  old  forms  from  the  new  moving  forces  of  the economy,  moral  standards  shift,  and  people  begin  to  treat  those  in command of the old institutions with growing disdain. This widespread revulsion  comes  into  evidence  well  before  people  develop  a  new coherent ideology of change. As we write, there is as yet little evidence of an articulate rejection of politics. That will come later. It has not yet occurred  to  most  of  your  contemporaries  that  a  life  without  politics  is possible.  What  we  have  in  the  final  years  of  the  twentieth  century  is inarticulate disdain. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Something similar happened in the late fifteenth century, but at that time it  was  religion  rather  than  politics  that  was  in  the  process  of  being downsized.  Notwithstanding  popular  belief  in  "the  sacredness  of  the sacerdotal office,"6 both the higher and lower ranks of clergy were held in the utmost contempt not unlike the popular attitude toward politicians and bureaucrats today. It was widely believed that the upper clergy were corrupt,  worldly,  and  venal.  And  not  without  reason.  Several  fifteenth-century popes 63</p>

<p class="calibre1">openly  sported  bastards.  The  lower  clergy  were  held  in  even  lower esteem  as  they  proliferated  in  country  and  town,  begging  for  alms  and frequently  offering  to  sell  God's  grace  and  the  forgiveness  of  sins  to anyone who would put cash into the bargain. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Beneath the "crust of superficial piety" 7 was a corrupt and increasingly disfunctional system. Many lost respect for those who ran it, long before anyone dared to say that it did not work. A life saturated with religion, making  no  distinction  between  the  spiritual  and  the  temporal,  had exhausted  its  possibilities.  Its  end  was  inevitable  long  before  Luther nailed his 95 theses on the church door at Wittenberg. </p>

<p class="calibre1">101</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-103"></a><b class="calibre4">A SECULAR REFORMATION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  the  reaction  against  saturation  politics  is  following  a similar path. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The death of the Soviet Union and the repudiation of socialism are part of  a  broad  pattern  of  depoliticization  sweeping  the  world.  This  is  now most  evident  in  a  growing  contempt  for  those  who  run  the  world's governments.  It  is  driven  only  in  part  by  the  realization  that  they  are corrupt,  and  prone  to  sell  "indulgences"  from  political  difficulty  in exchange  for  campaign  contributions  or  special  help  on  commodity trades to subvene their personal finances. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  reaction  against  politicians  is  also  motivated  by  the  widening realization that much of what they do at great cost is futile, in the same way that organizing another pilgrimage of penitents to march barefoot in the snow, or the founding of yet another order of mendicant monks in the late  fifteenth  century,  could  have  done  little  to  improve  productivity  or relieve pressures on living standards. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Last Days of the Holy Mother Church</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">At the end of the Middle Ages, the monolithic Church as an institution had  grown  senile  and  counterproductive,  a  marked  change  from  its positive economic contribution five centuries earlier. As we explored in the last chapter, the Church played a leading role at the end of the tenth century in establishing order and facilitating economic recovery from the anarchy that marked the close of the Dark Ages. At that time, the Church was indispensable to the survival of large numbers of small freeholders and serfs who made up the bulk of the Western European population. By the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century,  the  Church  had  become  a  major  drag upon  productivity.  The  burdens  it  imposed  upon  the  population  were pushing living standards down. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Much  the  same  thing  can  be  said  of  the  nationstate  today.  It  was  a necessary adaptation to the new megapolitical conditions created by the Gunpowder Revolution five centuries ago. The nationstate widened the scope  of  markets  and  displaced  fragmented  local  authorities  at  a  time 102</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-104"></a>when  more  encompassing  trading  areas  brought  large  returns.  The  fact that  merchants  almost  everywhere  in  Europe  spontaneously  allied themselves to the monarch at the center as he maneuvered to consolidate authority  is  itself  telling  evidence  that  the  nationstate  in  its  early  form was good for business. It helped lift the burdens on commerce imposed by feudal landlords and local magnates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">64</p>

<p class="calibre1">In a world where returns to violence were high and rising, the nationstate was a useful institution. But five centuries later, as this millennium draws to  a  close,  megapolitical  conditions  have  changed.  Returns  to  violence are  falling,  and  the  nationstate,  like  the  Church  at  the  twilight  of  the Middle Ages, is an anachronism that has become a drag on growth and productivity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like  the  Church  then,  the  nationstate  today  has  exhausted  its possibilities. It is bankrupt, an institution grown to a senile extreme. Like the  Church  then,  it  has  served  as  the  dominant  form  of  social organization  for  five  centuries.  Having  outlived  the  conditions  that brought it into existence, it is ripe for a fall. And fall it will. Technology is precipitating a revolution in the exercise of power that will destroy the nationstate  just  as  assuredly  as  gunpowder  weapons  and  the  printing press destroyed the monopoly of the medieval Church. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If our reasoning is correct, the nationstate will be replaced by new form of sovereignty, some of them unique in history, some reminiscent of the city-states  and  medieval  merchant  republics  of  the  premodern  world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What  was  old  will  be  new  after  the  year  2000.  And  what  was unimaginable will be commonplace. As the scale of technology plunges, governments  will  find  that  they  must  compete  like  corporations  for income,  charging  no  more  for  their  services  than  they  are  worth  to  the people who pay for them. The full implications of this change are all but unimaginable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">103</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-105"></a><b class="calibre4">THEN AND NOW</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Something similar might have been said five hundred years ago, at the turn of the fifteenth century. Then as now, Western civilization stood at the  threshold  of  a  momentous  transformation.  Although  almost  no  one knew it medieval society was dying. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Its death was neither widely anticipated no understood. Nonetheless, the prevailing mood was one of deep gloom. This is common at the end of an  era,  as  conventional  thinkers  sense  that  things  are  falling  apart,  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"the falcon cannot hear the falconer." Yet their mental inertia is often too great to comprehend the implications of the emerging configurations of power. Medieval historian Johan Huizinga wrote of the waning days of the Middle Ages, "The chroniclers of the fifteenth century have, nearly all, been the dupes of an absolute misappreciation of their times of which the real moving forces escaped their attention." 8</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Myths Betrayed</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Major  changes  in  the  underlying  dynamics  of  power  tend  to  confound conventional thinkers because they expose myths that rationalize the old order  but  lack  any  real  explanatory  power.  At  the  end  of  the  Middle Ages,  as  now  there  was  a  particularly  wide  gap  between  the  received myths and reality. As Huizinga said of the Europeans in the late fifteenth century, "Their whole system of ideas was permeated by the fiction that 65</p>

<p class="calibre1">chivalry ruled the world."' This has a close second in the contemporary assumption  that  it  is  ruled  by  votes  and  popularity  contests.  Neither proposition stands up to close scrutiny. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, the idea that the course of history is determined by democratic tallies  of  wishes  is  every  bit  as  silly  as  the  medieval  notion  that  it  is determined by an elaborated code of manners called chivalry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  saying  so  borders  on  heresy  suggests  how  divorced conventional thinking is from a realistic grasp of the dynamics of power in late industrial society. It is an issue we examine closely in this book. </p>

<p class="calibre1">104</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-106"></a>In our view, voting was an effect rather than a cause of the megapolitical conditions  that  brought  forth  the  modern  nationstate.  Mass  democracy and  the  concept  of  citizenship  flourished  as  the  nationstate  grew.  They will falter as the nationstate falters, causing every bit as much dismay in Washington as the erosion of chivalry caused in the court of the duke of Burgundy five hundred years ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">105</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-107"></a><b class="calibre4">PARALLELS  BETWEEN  CHIVALRY  AND</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">CITIZENSHIP</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  can  understand  how  and  why  the  importance  of  chivalric  oaths faded  away  with  the  transition  to  an  industrial  organization  of  society, you will be better positioned to see how citizenship as we now know it could fade away in the Information Age. Both served a similar function. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They facilitated the exercise of power under two quite different sets of megapolitical conditions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Feudal  oaths  prevailed  at  a  time  when  defensive  technology  was paramount,  sovereignties  were  fragmented,  and  private  individuals  and corporate bodies exercised military power in their own right. Before the Gunpowder  Revolution,  wars  had  normally  been  fought  by  small contingents  of  armed  men.  Even  the  most  powerful  monarchs  did  not have   <i class="calibre3">militum  perpetuum</i>,  or  standing  armies.  They  drew  their  military support from their vassals, the greater lords, who in turn drew upon their vassals, the lesser lords, who in turn drew upon  <i class="calibre3">their </i> vassals, the knights. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The whole chain of allegiance carried down the hierarchy to the person of the meanest social standing who was considered worthy to bear arms. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Uniforms or Divergences? </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike a modern army, a medieval army before the rise of citizenship did not  march  on  the  field  of  battle  outfitted  in  uniforms.  To  the  contrary, each retainer or vassal, each knight, baronet, or lord of different degree had  his  own  distinctive  livery  that  reflected  his  place  in  the  hierarchy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instead of uniforms, there were divergences that emphasized the vertical structure  of  society  in  which  each  station  was  different.  As  Huizinga said, medieval warriors were distinguished by "outward signs of . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">divergences: liveries, colors, badges, party cries." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor  were  wars  fought  only  by  governments  or  nations.  As  Martin  van Creveld has pointed out, modern notions of war, as stylized by strategists like Carl von Clausewitz, misrepresent the reality of premodern conflict. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Van Creveld writes: 66</p>

<p class="calibre1">106</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-108"></a>For a thousand years after the fall of Rome, armed conflict was waged by different kinds of social entities. Among them were barbarian tribes, the Church, feudal barons of every rank, free cities, even private individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor were the "armies" of the period anything like those we know today; indeed, it is difficult to find a word that will do them justice. War was waged  by  shoals  of  retainers  who  donned  military  garb  and  followed their lord. 11</p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  such  conditions,  it  was  obviously  crucial  to  the  lord  that  his retainers actually "donned their military garb and followed." Hence the heavy emphasis placed upon the chivalric oath. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The honor of the medieval knight and the duty of the conscript soldier served  parallel  functions.  The  medieval  man  was  bound  by  oaths  to individuals and the Church in much the way that moderns are bound by citizenship  to  the  nationstate.  Violating  an  oath  was  the  medieval equivalent of treason. People in late-medieval times went to extremes to avoid  violating  oaths,  just  as  millions  of  modern  citizens  went  to extremes in the World Wars, charging machine-gun nests to fulfill their duties as citizens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Both  chivalry  and  citizenship  added  an  extra  dimension  to  the  simple calculus that would otherwise deter unindoctrinated human beings from going  onto  a  battlefield  and  staying  there  when  the  going  got  rough. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Chivalry and citizenship both led people to kill and to risk death. Only demanding  and  exaggerated  values  that  are  strongly  reinforced  by leading institutions can serve that function. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Circumventing Cost-Benefit Analysis</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  success  and  survival  of  any  system  depends  upon  its  capacity  to marshal  military  effort  in  times  of  conflict  and  crisis.  Obviously,  the decision on the part of a medieval knight or a private in the trenches in World War I to risk his life in battle was not likely to be informed by a sober, cost-benefit calculation. Seldom are wars so easily fought, or do rewards for those who bear the brunt of the fighting so far overshadow the  possible  costs  that  an  army  of  economic  optimizers  could  be recruited  to  rush  out  to  the  battlefield.  Almost  every  war  and,  indeed, most battles have moments in which the tide could turn on a heartbeat. </p>

<p class="calibre1">107</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-109"></a>As  students  of  military  history  are  well  aware,  the  difference  between defeat and victory is often told by the valor, bravery, and ferocity with which individual soldiers take up their task. If the men doing the fighting are not willing to die over a piece of ground that would not be worth a fig once the battle stops, then they probably will not prevail against an otherwise evenly matched foe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This has important implications. The more effective sovereignties are in limiting defections and encouraging military effort, the more likely they are to prevail militarily. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  warfare,  the  most  useful  value  systems  induce  people  to  behave  in ways that short-term rational calculation would rule out. No organization could  mobilize  military  power  effectively  if  the  individuals  it  sent  into battle felt free to calculate where their own best advantage lay, and join in the fight or run away accordingly. If so, they would almost 67</p>

<p class="calibre1">never fight. Only under the most propitious circumstances, or the most desperate, would the rational person care to engage in a potentially lethal battle  based  upon  short-term  cost-benefit  analysis.  Perhaps   <i class="calibre3">Homo</i> <i class="calibre3">economicus</i> might fight on a sunny day, when the forces on his side were overwhelming,  the  enemy  weak,  and  the  potential  rewards  of  battle enticing.  Perhaps.  He  might  also  fight  if  backed  into  a  corner  by marauding cannibals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  those  are  extreme  circumstances.  What  of  the  more  common conditions  of  warfare,  which  are  neither  so  attractive  that  they  would pass the scrutiny of cost-benefit analysis nor so desperate that they afford no  way  out?  It  is  here  that  concepts  like  chivalry  and  citizenship  are important  contributors  to  the  successful  use  of  military  power.  Long before  a  battle  begins,  predominant  organizations  must  convince individuals  that  upholding  certain  duties  to  the  lord,  or  the  nationstate, are  more  important  than  life  itself.  The  myths  and  rationalizations  that societies employ to encourage risk-taking on the battlefield are a key part of their military prowess. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To  be  effective,  these  myths  must  be  tailored  to  the  prevailing megapolitical conditions. The fiction that chivalry rules the world means nothing  today,  especially  in  a  city  like  New  York.  But  it  was  the 108</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-110"></a>cherished  myth  of  feudalism.  It  justified  and  rationalized  the  ties  of obligation that bound everyone under the domination of the Church and a  warlike  nobility.  At  a  time  when  private  wars  of  covetousness  were commonplace,'12  the  exercise  of  power  and  the  very  survival  of individuals  depended  upon  the  willingness  of  others  to  fulfill  their promises of military service under conditions of duress. It was obviously crucial that those promises be dependable. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Before Nationality</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike  today,  the  concept  of  nationality  played  little  or  no  role  in establishing sovereignty in the Middle Ages. Monarchs, as well as some princes of the Church and powerful lords, possessed territories by private right. In a way that has no modern analogy, these lords could sell or give away territories or acquire new ones by conveyance or marriage as well as  by  conquest.  Today,  you  could  hardly  imagine  the  United  States falling  under  the  sovereignty  of  a  non-English-speaking  Portuguese president because he happened to marry the former American president's daughter. Yet something similar was commonplace in medieval Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Power  passed  by  hereditary  descent.  Cities  and  countries  changed sovereigns the way that antiques change owners. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In many cases, sovereigns were not native to the regions in which their properties lay. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sometimes they did not speak the local language, or spoke it badly with heavy accents. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But it made little difference to the ties of personal obligation whether a Spaniard was king of Athens, or an Austrian was king of Spain. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Corporate Sovereignty</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Sovereignty  was  also  exercised  by  religious  corporations  like  the Knights  Templar,  the  Knights  of  St.  John,  and  the  Teutonic  Knights. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These hybrid institutions 68</p>

<p class="calibre1">have no modern counterparts. They combined religious, social, judicial, and  financial  activities  with  sovereignty  over  localities.'3  While  they exercised territorial jurisdiction, they were almost the opposite of today's 109</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-111"></a>governments  in  that  nationality  played  no  role  in  the  mobilization  of their support or their scheme of governance. The members and officers of these religious orders were drawn from all parts of Christian Europe, or "Christendom," as it was known. </p>

<p class="calibre1">No one thought it appropriate or necessary that those who ruled be drawn from  the  local  populations.  The  mobilization  of  support  in  the fragmented  medieval  scheme  of  governance  did  not  depend  upon  a national  identity  or  duty  to  the  state,  as  in  modern  times,  but  upon personal loyalty and customary ties that had to be upheld as a matter of personal honor. These oaths could be sworn by anyone from anywhere provided he was otherwise deemed worthy by his station in life. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Vow</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Chivalric vows bound individuals to one another and were sworn on the honor of those who were parties to them. As Huizinga wrote, "in making a  vow,  people  imposed  some  privation  upon  themselves  as  a  spur  to accomplishment of the actions they were pledged to perform." So much importance was placed upon honoring vows that people frequently risked death or suffered serious consequences in order to avoid breaking their vows.  Often,  the  oaths  themselves  bound  individuals  to  perform  as matters  of  honor  acts  that  would  probably  seem  ludicrous  to  you  and most readers of this book. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For example, the Knights of the Star swore an oath never to retire "more than four acres from the battlefield, through which rule soon afterwards more  than  ninety  of  them  lost  their  lives."  15  The  prohibition  on  even tactical retreat is irrational as a military strategy. But it was a common imperative  of  the  chivalric  vows.  Before  the  Battle  of  Agincourt,  the king  of  England  issued  an  order  that  knights  on  patrol  should  remove their armor, on grounds that it would have been incompatible with their honor  to  withdraw  from  enemy  lines  if  they  were  wearing  their  coat armor.  It  so  happened  that  the  king  himself  got  lost  and  passed  by  the village that had been night quarters for the vanguard of his army. Since he  was  wearing  armor,  his  chivalric  honor  forbade  him  to  imply  turn around  when  he  discovered  his  mistake  and  return  to  the  village.  He spent the night in an exposed position. </p>

<p class="calibre1">110</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-112"></a>As  silly  as  this  example  seems,  King  Henry  probably  did  not miscalculate  in  thinking  that  he  would  have  risked  more  in  trespassing his honor by retreating, and thus setting a demoralizing example for his entire army, than he did by sleeping behind enemy lines. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  history  of  the  Middle  Ages  is  filled  with  examples  of  prominent people  fulfilling  pledges  that  would  seem  ridiculous  to  us.  In  many cases,  the  actions  proposed  involved  no  objective  connection  to  any benefit  other  than  a  vivid  demonstration  of  the  importance  those undertaking them placed upon the vow itself. Among the common vows: to  keep  one  eye  closed,  to  eat  and  drink  only  when  standing,  and  to become  a  self-imposed  cripple  by  entering  a  one-person  chain  gang. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There was a widespread custom of 69</p>

<p class="calibre1">wearing  painful  foot  irons.  If  today  you  saw  someone  struggling  along the  street  in  a  heavy  leg  iron,  you  would  probably  assume  that  he  was insane,  not  that  he  was  a  man  of  great  virtue.  Yet  in  the  context  of chivalry,  willingly  donning  such  a  device  was  a  badge  of  honor.  And there  were  many  similar  customs  that  would  seem  equally  ludicrous today.  As  Huizinga  describes  it,  many  took  a  pledge  "not  to  sleep  in  a bed  on  Saturday,  not  to  take  animal  food  on  Friday,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>  One  act  of asceticism  is  heaped  upon  another:  one  nobleman  promises  to  wear  no armor, to drink no wine one day in every week, not to sleep in a bed, not to sit down to meals, to wear the hair shirt." 16</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lent  survives  as  a  much  moderated  version  of  this  self-imposed discomfort. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  enthusiasts  for  vows  formed  orders  that  placed  particularly difficult  privations  on  their  members  as  tests  of  honor.  The  Order  of Clalois and Galoises, for example, dressed during summers in "furs and fur-lined  hoods  and  lighted  a  fire  in  the  hearth,  whereas  in  winter  they were only allowed to wear a simple coat without fur; neither mantles, not hats,  nor  gloves,  and  had  only  very  light  bed  clothes."  As  Huizinga reports, "It is not surprising that a great many members died of cold." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Flagellation, Then and Now</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  short  step  from  the  vow  that  imposed  danger  and  privation  to ordeals,  pilgrimages,  mortification,  discomfort,  and  even  purposefully self-inflicted  injury.  These  could  be  seen  as  highly  beneficial  and praiseworthy  in  the  medieval  period.  They  were  gestures  of  the seriousness  with  which  vows  were  held,  a  logic  that  is  not  entirely foreign even today to fraternity or sorority initiations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Stifling  in  summer,  freezing  in  winter,  or  walking  in  barefoot pilgrimages  in  the  snow  was  relatively  tame  compared  to  "the  grim torture"  of  self-flagellation.  This  was  a  particularly  medieval  form  of penance that came into being almost exactly at the same time feudalism began. It was first "adopted by hermits in the monastic communities of Camaldoli and Fonte Avellana early in the eleventh century." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rather than just walking barefoot in cold weather, flagellants organized processions in which they would march day and night, from one town to the  next.  "And  each  time  they  came  to  a  town  they  would  arrange themselves in groups before the church and flog themselves for hours on end."20</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  people  in  the  future  who  look  back  at  the  era  of  the nationstate  will  find  some  of  the  undertakings  done  in  the  twentieth century  in  the  name  of  citizenship  as  ludicrous  as  we  consider  self-flagellation.  From  the  vantage  point  of  the  Information  Society,  the spectacle of soldiers in the modern period traveling halfway around the world to entertain death out of loyalty to the nationstate will come to be seen as grotesque and silly. It will seem not far different from some of the extraordinary and 70</p>

<p class="calibre1">exaggerated  rites  of  chivalry,  like  walking  about  in  leg  irons,  which otherwise sensible people took pride in doing during the feudal period. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Chivalry Yields to Citizenship</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">113</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-115"></a>Chivalry faded away, to be replaced by citizenship, when megapolitical conditions changed and the military purpose of the vow to one's lord was antiquated.  The  world  of  gunpowder  weapons  and  industrial  armies involved  very  different  relations  between  the  individuals  who  did  the fighting  and  their  commanders.  Citizenship  emerged  when  returns  to violence were high and rising, and the state had vastly greater resources than the social entities that waged war in the medieval period. Because of its great power and wealth, the nationstate could strike a bargain directly with the mass of common soldiers who fought in its uniform. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  bargains  proved  to  be  far  cheaper  to  the  state  and  much  less troublesome  than  attempts  to  assemble  military  forces  by  negotiating with  powerful  lords  and  local  notables,  each  of  whom  was  capable  of resisting demands that ran counter to his interests as no individual citizen in the nationstate conceivably could. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  explore  at  greater  depth  later,  citizenship  crucially depended upon the fact that no individual or small group of individuals was megapolitically capable of exercising military power independently. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As information technology alters the logic of battle, it will antiquate the myths of citizenship just as assuredly as gunpowder antiquated medieval chivalry. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Hell's Angels on Horseback</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The aristocracy of mounted warriors that dominated Western Europe for centuries  were  hardly  the  gentlemen  their  descendants  became.  They were rough and violent. In today's terms they could be better understood as the medieval equivalent of motorcycle gangs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  rules  of  manners  and  pretenses  of  chivalry  served  more  to  temper their excesses than as a description of the way they really behaved. Even an encyclopedic account of the rules and obligations of chivalry would have  revealed  little  or  nothing  about  the  foundations  of  the  nobility's power. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Perfection as a Synonym for Exhaustion</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">114</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-116"></a>The  advent  of  effective  gunpowder  weapons  at  the  end  of  the  fifteenth century detonated a powerful blast under their feet-just as armed knights had  perfected  their  art  as  never  before.  By  then,  careful  breeding  had finally  produced  a  battle  horse  sixteen  hands  high,  a  steed  with  the stature  to  carry  comfortably  a  mounted  knight  in  full  armor.  Yet</p>

<p class="calibre1">"perfection,"  as  C.  Northcote  Parkinson  shrewdly  noted,  "is  achieved only by institutions on the point of collapse."21 Just as the new warhorse was perfected, new weapons were 71</p>

<p class="calibre1">deployed  to  blast  horse  and  knight  from  the  battlefield.  These  new gunpowder weapons could be fired by commoners. They required little skill to use but were expensive to procure in quantity. Their proliferation steadily  increased  the  importance  of  commerce  as  compared  to agriculture, which had been the foundation of the feudal economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">War at a Higher Scale</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">How did gunpowder weapons precipitate such a transformation? For one thing,  they  raised  the  scale  of  fighting,  which  meant  that  waging  war soon  became  far  more  costly  than  it  had  been  during  the  medieval period.  Before  the  Gunpowder  Revolution,  wars  had  normally  been fought by groups so small that they could be levied over a small and poor territory. Gunpowder gave a new advantage to fighting on a larger scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Only leaders with claims on rich subjects could afford to field effective forces under the new conditions. Those leaders who best accommodated the growth of commerce, usually monarchs who allied themselves with the urban merchants, found that they enjoyed a competitive advantage on the  battlefield.  In  van  Creveld's  words,  "thanks  in  part  to  the  superior financial  resources  at  their  disposal,  they  could  purchase  more  cannon than anybody else and blast the opposition to pieces."22</p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  though  it  would  be  centuries  before  the  full  logic  of  gunpowder weapons  would  be  unleashed  in  the  citizen  armies  of  the  French Revolution, an early hint of the transformation of warfare bygunpowder was the adoption of military uniforms in the Renaissance. The uniforms aptly  symbolize  the  new  relations  between  the  warrior  and  the nationstate  that  went  hand  in  hand  with  the  transition  from  chivalry  to citizenship.  In  effect,  the  new  nationstate  would  strike  a  "uniform" </p>

<p class="calibre1">bargain with its citizens, unlike the special, divergent bargains struck by 115</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-117"></a>the monarch or the pope with a long chain of vassals under feudalism. In the  old  system,  everyone  had  a  different  place  in  an  architectonic hierarchy. Everyone had a bargain as unique as his coat of arms and the colorful pennants he flew. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Lowering  the  Opportunity  Costs  of  Riches</b>  Gunpowder  weapons radically altered the nature of society in yet another way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  separated  the  exercise  of  power  from  physical  strength,  thereby lowering the opportunity costs of mercantile activity. Rich merchants no longer  had  to  depend  upon  their  own  finesse  and  strength  in  hand-to-hand  combat  or  on  mercenaries  of  uncertain  loyalty  to  defend themselves. They could hope to be defended by the new, larger armies of the great monarchs. As William Playfair said of the Middle Ages, "While human  force  was  the  power  by  which  men  were  annoyed,  in  cases  of hostility,  ..  .  [t]o  be  wealthy  and  powerful  long  together  was  then impossible."  23  When  gunpowder  came  along,  it  was  impossible  to  be powerful without being rich. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Status and Static Understanding</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">72</p>

<p class="calibre1">For many of the same reasons that most people today are ill-prepared to anticipate  the  new  dynamics  of  the  Information  Society,  the  leading thinkers of medieval society were unable to anticipate or understand the rise of commerce that played so important a part in shaping the modern period. Most people five centuries ago viewed their changing society in static  terms.  As  Huizinga  said,  "Very  little  property  is,  in  the  modern sense,  liquid,  while  power  is  not  yet  associated  predominantly  with money; it is still rather inherent in the person and depends on a sort of religious  awe  which  he  inspires;  it  makes  itself  felt  by  pomp  and magnificence,  or  a  numerous  train  of  faithful  followers.  Feudal  or hierarchic thought expresses the idea of grandeur by visible signs. " 24</p>

<p class="calibre1">Because people in the late Middle Ages thought before all else of status, they  were  ill-prepared  to  comprehend  that  merchants  could  possibly contribute  anything  of  importance  to  the  life  of  the  realm.  Almost without exception, merchants were commoners. They fit at the bottom of the three estates, below the nobility and the clergy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">116</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-118"></a>Even  the  more  perceptive  thinkers  of  late-medieval  society  failed  to appreciate  the  importance  of  commerce  and  other  forms  of  enterprise outside  of  farming  for  accumulating  wealth.  To  them,  poverty  was  an apostolic  virtue.  They  literally  made  no  distinction  between  a  wealthy banker  and  a  beggar.  In  Huizinga's  words,  "No  distinction  in  principle was made in the third estate, between rich and poor citizens, nor between townsmen  and  country-people."25  Neither  occupation  nor  wealth mattered in their scheme, merely chivalric status. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  blindness  to  the  economic  dimension  of  life  was  reinforced  by churchmen,  who  were  the  ideological  guardians  of  medieval  life.  They were  so  far  from  grasping  the  importance  of  commerce  that  one widelyapplauded  !fifteenth-century  reform  program  proposed  that  all persons of nonnoble status be required to devote themselves exclusively to  handicrafts  or  farm  labor.  No  role  was  contemplated  for  commerce whatsoever. 26</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"The date 1492, conventionally used to separate medieval from modern</i> <i class="calibre3">history, serves as well as</i> <i class="calibre3">any other dividing point, for in the perspective</i> <i class="calibre3">of  world  history,  Columbus'  voyage  symbolizes  the</i> <i class="calibre3">beginning  of  a  new</i> <i class="calibre3">relationship' between Western Europe and the rest of the world."27</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">FREDERIC C. LANE</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE BIRTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Many of the keenest minds of the fifteenth century totally missed one of the more important developments in history, one that began under their eyes.  The  eclipse  of  feudalism  marked  the  onset  of  the  great  modern phase  of  Western  predominance.  It  was  a  period  of  rising  returns  to violence  and  rising  scale  in  enterprise.  For  the  past  two  and  a  half centuries,  the  modern  economy  has  delivered  an  unparalleled  rise  in living  standards  for  that  fraction  of  the  world  that  enjoyed  its  greatest benefits.  The  catalysts  for  these  changes  were  new  technologies,  from gunpowder weapons to the printing press, which changed the boundaries of life in ways that few could grasp. </p>

<p class="calibre1">73</p>

<p class="calibre1">117</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-119"></a>By  the  final  decade  of  the  fifteenth  century,  explorers  like  Columbus were  just  beginning  to  open  an  approach  to  vast,  unknown  continents. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For the first time in the immemorial ages of human existence, the whole world  was  compassed.  Galleons,  new  high-masted  improvisations  on Mediterranean galleys, circumnavigated the globe, charting the passages that  were  to  become  trade  routes  and  thoroughfares  for  disease  and conquest.  Conquistadors  wielding  their  new  bronze  cannon  on  sea  and on  shore  blasted  open  new  horizons.  They  found  fortunes  in  gold  and spices,  planted  the  seeds  of  new  cash  crops,  from  tobacco  to  potatoes, and staked out new grazing lands for their cattle. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The First Industrial Technology</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Just  as  the  cannon  was  opening  new  economic  horizons,  the  printing press opened new intellectual horizons. It was the first machine of mass production,  a  signature  technology  that  marked  the  onset  of industrialism.  In  saying  this,  we  share  the  view  advanced  by  Adam Smith  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Wealth  of  Nations</i>  that  the  Industrial  Revolution  had already happened well before he wrote. It had not reached maturity, to be sure, but the principles of mass production and the factory system were well  established.  His  famous  example  of  the  pin  manufacturers  makes this case. Smith explains how eighteen separate operations are employed to  produce  pins.  Because  of  specialized  technology  and  the  division  of labor, each employee could make 4,800 times more pins in a day than an individual could fabricate on his own.28</p>

<p class="calibre1">Smith's  example  underscores  the  fact  that  the  Industrial  Revolution began  centuries  earlier  than  historians  conventionally  assume.  Most textbooks would date its origins to the middle of the eighteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That  is  not  unreasonable  as  a  date  for  the  takeoff  stage  in  the improvement of living standards. But the actual megapolitical transition between  feudalism  and  industrialism  began  much  earlier,  at  the  end  of the  fifteenth  century.  Its  impact  was  felt  almost  immediately  in  the transformation of dominant institutions, particularly in the eclipse of the medieval Church. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  historians  who  place  the  Industrial  Revolution  later  are  really measuring something else, the takeoff of living standards attributable to mass production powered by engines. This raised the value of unskilled 118</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-120"></a>labor  and  led  to  falling  prices  for  a  wide  variety  of  consumer  goods. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  fact  that  living  standards  began  to  rise  sharply  at  different times  in  different  countries  is  a  tip-off  that  something  other  than  the megapolitical  transition  is  being  measured.  <i class="calibre3">The  Cambridge  Economic</i> <i class="calibre3">History  of  Europe</i>  speaks  of  "Industrial  Revolutions"  in  the  plural, explicitly linking them to the sustained growth of national incomes.29 In Japan  and  Russia,  this  income  surge  was  delayed  until  the  end  of  the nineteenth century. The rise in living standards and sustained growth of national  income  in  other  parts  of  Asia  and  some  parts  of  Africa  was  a twentiethcentury phenomenon. In some parts of Africa, sustained growth remains  a  dream  to  this  day.  But  that  does  not  mean  that  these  regions are not living in the modern age. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Falling Income in Transition</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">74</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  growth  of  income  is  not  synonymous  with  the  advent  of industrialism.  The  shift  to  an  industrial  society  was  a  megapolitical event, not measurable directly in income statistics. Indeed, real incomes for most Europeans fell for the first two centuries of the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  only  began  rising  sometime  after  the  beginning  of  the  eighteenth century, and they did not recover to levels of 1250 until about 1750. We place the launch of the Industrial Age at the end of the fifteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  industrial  features  of  early-modern  technology,  including chemically powered weapons and printing presses, that precipitated the collapse of feudalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Lowering the Cost of Knowledge</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  capacity  to  mass-produce  books  was  incredibly  subversive  to medieval  institutions,  just  as  microtechnology  will  prove  subversive  to the modern nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Printing rapidly undermined the Church's monopoly on the word of God, even as it created a new market for heresy. Ideas inimical to the closed feudal society spread rapidly, as 10 million books were published by the final decade of the fifteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">119</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-121"></a>Because the Church attempted to suppress the printing press, most of the new volumes were published in those areas of Europe where the writ of established  authority  was  the  weakest.  This  may  prove  to  be  a  close analogy  with  attempts  by  the  U.S.  government  today  to  suppress encryption  technology.  The  Church  found  that  censorship  did  not suppress  the  spread  of  subversive  technology;  it  merely  assured  that  it was put to its most subversive use. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Depreciating the Monasteries</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  apparently  innocent  uses  of  the  printing  press  were  subversive because of their content. Merely the spread of knowledge of the fortunes to be earned by intrepid adventurers and merchants was itself a powerful solvent dissolving the bonds of feudal obligation. The temptation of new markets along with the need and opportunity to fund armies and navies on a large scale, gave money a value it had lacked in the feudal centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These new avenues for investment, reinforced by powerful weapons that raised the returns to violence, made it increasingly costly to the lord in the  hinterland  or  the  merchant  in  the  city  to  donate  his  capital  to  the Church.  Thus  the  very  creation  of  investment  opportunities  outside  of landholdings  destabilized  the  institutions  of  feudalism  and  undercut  its ideology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  subversive  consequence  of  the  printing  press  was  its  effect  in dramatically  lowering  the  costs  of  reproducing  information.  A  crucial reason why literacy and economic progress had been so minimal during the Middle Ages was the high cost of duplicating manuscripts by hand. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As we have seen, one of the major productive functions assumed by the Church  after  the  fall  of  Rome  was  reproducing  books  and  manuscripts inBenedictine  monasteries.  This  was  an  extremely  costly  undertaking. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One of the more dramatic consequences of printing was to devalue the scriptoria,  where  monks  labored  day  after  day,  month  after  month  to produce manuscripts 75</p>

<p class="calibre1">that  could  be  duplicated  in  hours  by  printing  presses.  The  new technology  made  the  Benedictine  scriptorium  an  obsolete  and  costly means  of  reproducing  knowledge.  This,  in  turn,  made  the  religious orders  and  the  Church  that  sustained  the  scribes  less  economically important. </p>

<p class="calibre1">120</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-122"></a>Mass production of books ended the Church's monopoly on Scripture, as well  as  on  other  forms  of  information.  The  wider  availability  of  books reduced  the  cost  of  literacy  and  thus  multiplied  the  number  of  thinkers who were in a position to offer their own opinions on important subjects, particularly theological subjects. As theological historian Euan Cameron put it, "[a] series of publishing milestones" in the first two decades of the sixteenth century set the groundwork for the application of "modern text criticism  to  Scriptures."  30  This  "threatened  the  monopoly"  of  the Church "by questioning corrupt readings of texts which had been used to support  traditional  dogmas."31  This  new  knowledge  encouraged  the emergence of competitive Protestant sects who sought to formulate their own interpretations of the Bible. Mass production of books lowered the cost of heresy and gave the heretics large audiences of readers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Publishing  also  helped  destroy  the  medieval  worldview.  The  greater availability  and  lower  costs  for  information  led  to  shifts  away  from  a view of the world linked by symbolism rather than causal connections. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Symbolism's image of the world is distinguished by impeccable order, architectonic  structure,  hierarchic  subordination.  For  each  symbolic connection  implies  a  difference  of  rank  or  sanctity.  .  .  .  The  walnut signifies  Christ;  the  sweet  kernel  is  His  divine  nature,  the  green  and pulpy outer peel is His humanity, the wooden shell between is the cross. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thus all things raise the thoughts to the eternal..."32</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  symbolic  mode  of  thinking  not  only  complemented  a  hierarchic structure of society; it also suited illiteracy. Ideas conveyed by symbols in wood-cuts were accessible to an illiterate population. By contrast, the advent of printing in the modern period led to the development of causal connections, employing the scientific method, for a literate population. </p>

<p class="calibre1">121</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-123"></a><b class="calibre4">A PARALLEL FOR TODAY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Medieval  society,  seemingly  so  stable  and  secure  in  its  beliefs  in  the middle of the fifteenth century, was rapidly transformed. Its predominant institution,  the  Church,  saw  its  monopoly  challenged  and  shattered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Authority  that  had  been  unquestioned  for  centuries  was  suddenly  in dispute. Beliefs and loyalties more sacred than those that bind any citizen to  a  nationstate  today  were  reconsidered  and  renounced  within  a  few short years, all because of a technological revolution that came into its own in the last decade of the fifteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We believe that change as dramatic as that of five hundred years ago will happen again. The Information Revolution will destroy the monopoly of power  of  the  nationstate  as  surely  as  the  Gunpowder  Revolution destroyed  the  Church's  monopoly.  There  is  a  striking  analogy  between the  situation  at  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century,  when  life  had  become thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and that of today, when the world has 76</p>

<p class="calibre1">become  saturated  with  politics.  The  Church  then  and  the  nationstate today are both examples of institutions grown to a senile extreme. Like the  late-medieval  Church,  the  nationstate  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth century is a deeply indebted institution that can no longer pay its way. Its operations  are  ever  more  irrelevant  and  even  counterproductive  to  the prosperity  of  those  who  not  long  ago  might  have  been  its  staunchest supporters. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Impoverished, Grasping, and Extravagant" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Just as government today offers poor value for the money it collects, so did  the  Church  at  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century.  As  ecclesiastical historian  Euan  Cameron  put  it,  "[A]n  impoverished  local  priesthood seemed to offer a poor service for the money it demanded; much of what was  levied  effectively  'disappeared'  into  enclosed  monasteries  or  the arcane  areas  of  higher  education  or  administration.  In  spite  of  gifts prodigally given to some sectors of the Church, the institution as a whole managed  to  appear  simultaneously  impoverished,  grasping,  and 122</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-124"></a>extravagant."33 It would be hard to deny the parallel with late-twentiethcentury government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Religious  observances  in  the  late  fifteenth  century  grew  like  programs proliferating  in  welfare  states  today.  Not  only  did  special  benedictions multiply endlessly, along with the supply of saints and saints' bones, but every year there were more churches, more convents, more monasteries, more  friaries,  more  confessors  (resident  household  priests),  more preacherships,  more  cathedral  chapters,  more  endowed  chantries,  more relic  cults,  more  religious  co-fraternities,  more  religious  festivals,  and new  holy  days.  Services  grew  longer.  Prayers  and  hymns  grew  more complicated.  One  after  another,  new  mendicant  orders  appeared  to  beg for  alms.  The  result  was  institutional  overload  similar  to  that characterizing heavily politicized societies today. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Religious  festivals  and  feast  days  proliferated  on  all  sides.  Religious services  grew  more  numerous,  with  special  festivals  in  honor  of  the seven  sorrows  of  Mary,  of  her  sisters,  and  of  all  the  saints  of  Jesus' </p>

<p class="calibre1">genealogy.34 For the faithful to meet their religious obligations became increasingly  costly  and  burdensome,  much  as  the  costs  of  remaining within the law have proliferated today. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Innocents Pay</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Then  as  now,  the  productive  bore  a  growing  burden  of  income redistribution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  costs  were  rising  more  sharply  than  anyone  in  authority recognized because of a shift in the use of capital. The relative advantage of  holding  land  as  compared  to  money  capital  was  falling.  Yet  the medieval  mind  continued  to  think  in  terms  of  a  status-bound  society, where social position was determined by who you were, rather than by your skill in deploying capital effectively. Little or no consideration was given  to  the  rising  opportunity  costs  of  staging  exaggerated  religious observances. These costs fell most heavily upon the more ambitious and hardworking  peasants,  burghers,  and  yeoman  farmers,  who  depended more than the aristocracy upon deploying their capital usefully. </p>

<p class="calibre1">123</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-125"></a>They  were  obliged  to  shoulder  a  disproportionate  cost  of  outfitting  the tables at the 77</p>

<p class="calibre1">endless feasts and holy days (holidays), as well as paying to support an extravagant Church bureaucracy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Counterproductive Regulation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">At  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century,  the  Church  largely  controlled  the regulatory  powers  that  have  since  been  assumed  by  governments.  The Church  dominated  important  areas  of  law,  recording  deeds,  registering marriages  probating  wills,  licensing  trades,  titling  land,  and  stipulating terms  and  conditions  of  commerce.  The  details  of  life  were  almost  as thoroughly regulated by canon law as they are today by bureaucracy, and to  much  the  same  end  Just  as  political  regulation  today  has  become riddled  with  confusions  and  contradictions,  so  canon  law  was  five hundred years ago. These regulations often suppressed and complicated commerce  in  ways  that  revealed  that  facilitating  productivity  was  far from the minds of the regulators. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  example,  it  was  forbidden  to  do  business  for  an  entire  year  on whatever  day  of  the  week  the  most  recent  twenty-eighth  of  December happened  to  fall.  Thus  if  it  was  a  Tuesday,  no  legal  business  could  be conducted on Tuesdays as an obligatory expression of piety in honor of the Slaughter of the Innocents. On years when December 28 fell on any day other than Sunday, this injunction hampered the potential for many types  of  commerce,  increasing  costs  by  delaying  transactions  or forestalling them altogether. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Monopoly Pricing</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Canon law was also imposed to reinforce monopoly prices. The Church earned  significant  revenues  from  the  sale  of  alum  mined  from  its properties in Tolfa, Italy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When some of its customers in the textile industry showed a preference for cheaper alum imported from Turkey, the Vatican attempted to sustain its monopoly pricing through canon law, declaring it sinful to use the less costly alum. Merchants who persisted in purchasing the cheaper Turkish 124</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-126"></a>product  were  excommunicated.  The  famous  ban  on  eating  meat  on Friday originated in the same spirit. The Church was not only the largest feudal landholder; it also held major fisheries. Church Fathers discovered a  theological  necessity  for  the  pious  to  eat  fish,  which  not  incidentally ensured a demand for their product at a time when transport and sanitary conditions discouraged fish consumption. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like the nationstate today, the late-medieval Church not only regulated specific industries to directly underpin its own interests; it also made the most  of  its  regulatory  powers  to  gain  revenue  for  itself  in  other  ways. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Clerics  went  to  special  pains  to  promulgate  regulations  and  edicts  that were difficult to abide by. For example, incest was very broadly defined, so  that  even  remote  cousins  and  persons  related  only  by  marriage required special dispensation from the Church to marry. As this included almost  everyone  in  many  small  European  villages  before  the  era  of modern  travel,  selling  waivers  for  incestuous  marriages  became  a thriving source of Church revenue. Even sex within marriage itself was tightly circumscribed by ecceliastic regulation. Sexual relations between spouses were illegal on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, as well as 78</p>

<p class="calibre1">for  forty  days  prior  to  Easter  and  Christmas.  Further,  couples  were  to abstain from sex for three days prior to receiving communion. In other words,  married  couples  were  forbidden  to  enjoy  sex  without  an indulgence for a minimum of 55 percent of the days of the year. In  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Bishop’s Brothels</i>, historian E. J. Burford suggests that these "idiotic" </p>

<p class="calibre1">regulations  of  marriage  helped  stimulate  the  growth  of  medieval prostitution, from which the Church profited mightily.35 Burford reports that  the  Bishop  of  Winchester  was  for  many  centuries  the  principal  of London's  Bankside  brothels  in  Southwark.  Further,  ecclesiastical profiteering  from  prostitution  was  by  no  means  merely  a  local  English affair:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Pope Sixtus IV (c. 1471) who allegedly caught syphilis from one of his many mistresses-became the first pope to issue licenses to prostitutes and to levy a tax on their earnings, augmenting vastly the papal revenues in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">125</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-127"></a>process. Indeed the Roman Curia partly financed the building of St. Peter's by this tax and the sale of licenses. </p>

<p class="calibre1">His successor, Pope Leo X, is said to have made some twenty-two thousand gold ducats through the sale of licenses, four times as much as he made by selling</p>

<p class="calibre1">indulgences in Germany. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  the  famous  rule  of  celibacy  imposed  on  priests  was  a  lucrative source  of  revenue  for  the  medieval  Church.  As  Burford  reports,  the Church  imposed  'a  racket  known  as  cullagium,"  a  fee  imposed  upon</p>

<p class="calibre1">"concubinary  priests."37  This  proved  so  lucrative  that  it  was  imposed uniformly upon all priests by bishops in France and Germany, in spite of the fact that the Lateran Council in 1215 had denounced "this disgraceful traffic by which such prelates regularly sell permission to sin." 38 It was merely one of many lucrative markets for the sale of licenses to infringe canon  law  and  regulation,  a  trade  motivated  by  the  same  logic  that impels  grasping  politicians  to  seek  arbitrary  regulatory  powers  over commerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Indulgences</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The power to regulate arbitrarily is also the power to sell an exemption from  the  harm  such  regulations  can  do.  The  Church  sold  permits,  or</p>

<p class="calibre1">"indulgences," authorizing everything from relief from petty burdens on commerce  to  permission  to  eat  dairy  products  in  Lent.  These</p>

<p class="calibre1">"indulgences" were not only sold at high prices to the aristocracy and the rich burghers. They were also packaged as lottery prizes much like the government-run  lotteries  of  today  to  attract  the  pennies  of  the  poor.39</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  trade  in  indulgences  increased  as  the  Church's  expenditures  outran its  income.  This  led  many  to  infer  the  obvious,  that  the  institutional Church  was  using  its  powers  primarily  to  raise  revenues.  As  a contemporary critic put it, "[C]anon law was instituted solely for the 79</p>

<p class="calibre1">purpose of making a great deal of money; whoever would be a Christian has to buy his way out of its provisions."40</p>

<p class="calibre1">126</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-128"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Bureaucratic Overload</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  costs  of  supporting  institutionalized  religion  at  the  end  of  the fifteenth  century  had  reached  a  historic  extreme,  much  as  the  costs  of supporting  government  have  reached  a  senile  extreme  today.  The  more life was saturated with religion, the more expensive and bureaucratic the Church became. In Cameron's words, "It was far easier to find people to fill the vastly increased number of Church posts at the end of the Middle Ages,  than  to  find  money  to  pay  for  them."41  Just  as  bankrupt governments today scrounge for revenues in counterproductive ways, so did  the  Church  five  hundred  years  ago.  Indeed,  the  churchmen  used some of the same predatory tricks mastered by the politicians today. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The medieval Church five hundred years ago, like the nationstate today, consumed  more  of  society's  resources  than  it  ever  had  before,  or  ever would again. The Church then, like the state today, seemed incapable of functioning and sustaining itself on even record amounts of revenue. Just as  the  state  has  come  to  dominate  late-industrial  economies,  spending more than half of all revenue in some Western European countries, so the Church  dominated  the  late-feudal  economy,  draining  resources  and retarding growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Deficit Spending in the Fifteenth Century</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church  resorted  to  every  conceivable  expedient  to  squeeze  more money  out  of  its  harges  to  feed  its  overgrown  bureaucracy.  Regions directly under the lordship of the Church were required to pay higher and higher taxes. In provinces and kingdoms where the Church lacked direct taxing power, the Vatican imposed "annates," a payment to be made by the local sovereign in lieu of direct ecclesiastic taxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Church,  like  the  state  today,  also  raided  its  own  coffers,  diverting funds from benefactions earmarked for specific uses to pay for general overhead expenses. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Benefices  and  venal  religious  offices  were  openly  sold,  as  were  the income streams from tithes. In effect, the interests in tithes became the ecclesiastic  equivalent  of  bonds  issued  by  modern  governments  to finance their chronic deficits. </p>

<p class="calibre1">127</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-129"></a>While the Church was the ideological defender of feudalism and critic of commerce  and  capitalism,  like  the  nationstate  today,  it  utilized  every available marketing technique to optimize its own revenues. The Church operated  a  thriving  business  In  the  sale  of  sacramentals,  including consecrated  candles,  palms  blessed  on  Palm  Sunday,  "herbs  blessed  on the Feast of the Assumption, and especially the varieties of Holy Water." </p>

<p class="calibre1">42</p>

<p class="calibre1">Like today's politicians who threaten constituents with curtailed garbage pickup and other indignities if they decline to pay higher taxes, religious authorities  in  the  fifteenth  century  were  also  prone  to  cutting  off religious services to blackmail 80</p>

<p class="calibre1">congregations into paying arbitrary fines. Often the fines were imposed for some petty offense done by a few persons who need not even have been  members  of  the  congregation  in  question.  For  example,  in  1436, Bishop Jacques Du Chatelier, "a very ostentatious, grasping man," closed the  Church  of  the  Innocents  in  Paris  for  twenty-two  days,  halting  all religious services while waiting for an impossibly large fine to be paid by  two  beggars.  The  men  had  quarreled  in  the  church  and  shed  a  few drops of blood, which the bishop claimed had deconsecrated the church. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He would not allow anyone to use the church for weddings, burials, or the normal sacraments of the calendar until his fine was paid.43</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Hatred of Church Leaders</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Little  wonder  that  the  common  opinion  of  the  late  fifteenth  century despised the higher and lower clergy, much as common opinion in highly politicized  societies  today  despises  the  bureaucracy  and  politicians.  As Johan Huizinga put it, "Hatred is the right word to use in this context, for hatred  it  was,  latent,  but  general  and  persistent.  The  people  never wearied  of  hearing  the  vices  of  the  clergy  arraigned."45  Part  of  the reason  that  people  were  commonly  convinced  that  the  Church  was</p>

<p class="calibre1">"grasping  and  extravagant"  is  that  it  was  true.  "The  worldliness  of  the higher ranks of the clergy and the deterioration of the lower grades" 46</p>

<p class="calibre1">were too obvious to miss. From the parish priest to the pope himself, the clergy  appeared  to  be  corrupt  as  only  the  personnel  of  a  predominant institution can be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Five  hundred  years  ago,  the  pope,  Alexander  VI,  made  even  Giuho Andreotti  and  Bill  Clinton  seem  like  exemplars  of  integrity.  Alexander VI was renown for his wild parties. As a cardinal in Siena, he staged a famous  orgy  to  which  only  "Siena's  most  beautiful  young  women  had been  invited,  but  their  'husbands,  fathers,  and  brothers'  had  been excluded."47 The Siena orgy was famous, but it later proved to be tame compared  to  those  Alexander  threw  after  becoming  pope.  Perhaps  the most  lurid  of  those  was  the  so-called  Ballet  of  the  Chestnuts,  which involved  Rome's  "fifty  most  beautiful  whores"  in  a  copulation  contest with  the  Church  Fathers  and  other  important  Romans.  As  William Manchester describes it, "Servants kept score of each man's orgasms, for the  pope  greatly  admired  virility...After  everyone  was  exhausted,  His Holiness  distributed  prizes-cloaks,  boots,  caps,  and  fine  silken  tunics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  winners,  the  diarist  wrote,  were  those  who  made  love  with  those courtesans the greatest number of times."48</p>

<p class="calibre1">81</p>

<p class="calibre1">Alexander fathered at least seven and perhaps eight illegitimate children. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One of his apparent sons, Giovanni, was the so-called Infans Romanus, born to Alexander's illegitimate daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, when she was 129</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-131"></a>eighteen. In a secret papal bull, Alexander admitted fathering Giovanni. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If he was not the father, he was certainly the grandfather on both sides. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  pope  was  involved  in  a  three-way  incestuous  affair  with  Lucrezia, who  was  also  the  mistress  of  Juan,  duke  of  Gandia,  Alexander's  oldest illegitimate  son,  as  well  as  the  mistress  of  another  illegitimate  son, Cardinal Cesare Borgia. Cesare was the prince of the Church who served as Niccolo Machiavelli's inspiration for  <i class="calibre3">The Prince</i>. Cesare was a killer, as was the pope, who was known to have plotted several murders. One or the other of them apparently became jealous of Juan, whose lifeless body was fished out of the Tiber River on June 15, l497. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  leadership  of  the  late-medieval  Church  was  as  corrupt  as  the leadership of the nationstate today. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-132"></a><b class="calibre4">HYPOCRISY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Beneath  a  "superficial  crust  of  piety,"  late-medieval  society  was remarkably blasphemous, irreverent, and debauched. Churches were the favorite  trysting  places  of  young  men  and  women,  and  frequent gathering spots of prostitutes and vendors of obscene pictures. Historians report  that  "the  irreverence  of  daily  religious  practice  was  almost unbounded.”  Choristers  hired  to  chant  for  the  souls  of  the  dead commonly substituted profane words in the mass. Vigils and processions, which played a far bigger role in medieval religious practice than they do today, were nonetheless "disgraced by ribaldry, mockery and drinking." </p>

<p class="calibre1">So  said  late-medieval  Europe's  leading  theological  authority,  Denis  the Carthusian. 52</p>

<p class="calibre1">While such a report could be challenged as the griping of a stiff-lipped moralist, it is merely one of many accounts that paint the same picture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  is  ample  reason  to  believe  that  the  bawdy  and  the  sacred  were frequently close companions in medieval life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pilgrimages, for example, so often degenerated into riot and debauchery that  high-minded  reformers  argued  without  success  that  they  be suppressed. Local religious processions also provided regular occasions for mobs to vandalize, loot, and generally indulge in whatever drunken antics caught their fancy. Even when people sat still to hear mass, it was frequently  not  a  sober  experience.  Prodigious  quantities  of  wine  were consumed  in  church,  especially  on  festival  nights.  Accounts  from  the Council  of  Strasbourg  show  that  those  who  "watched  in  prayer"  on  St. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Adolphus  Night  drank  1,100  liters  of  wine  provided  by  the  council  in honor of the saint. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jean  Gerson,  a  leading  fifteenth-century  theologian,  reports  that  "the most sacred festivals, even Christmas night," were spent "in debauchery, playing at cards, swearing 82</p>

<p class="calibre1">and  blaspheming."  When  'admonished  for  these  lapses,  the  common people "plead the example of the nobility and the clergy, who behave in like manner with impunity."53</p>

<p class="calibre1">131</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-133"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Piety and Compassion</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The piety that rationalized the saturation of society by organized religion in  the  late  Middle  Ages  served  the  same  purpose  as  the  "compassion" </p>

<p class="calibre1">that is meant to justify the political domination of life today. The sale of indulgences  to  satisfy  a  desire  for  piety  without  morals  parallels  lavish welfare spending to slake the pretense of compassion without charity. It was  largely  immaterial  whether  the  actual  effect  of  received  practices was  to  improve  moral  character  or  save  souls,  just  as  it  is  largely immaterial whether a welfare program actually improves the lives of the people to whom it is directed. "Piety," </p>

<p class="calibre1">like "compassion," was an almost superstitious invocation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In a time when causal relationships were scarcely understood, rituals and sacraments of the Church permeated every phase of life. ". . . A journey, a  task,  a  visit,  were  equally  attended  by  a  thousand  formalities: benedictions, ceremonies, formulas." 54</p>

<p class="calibre1">Prayers inscribed on pieces of parchment were strung like necklaces on those suffering from fevers. Malnourished girls draped locks of their hair in front of the image of St. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Urban  to  prevent  further  hair  loss.  Peasants  in  Navarre  marched  in processions behind an image of St. Peter to solicit rain during droughts</p>

<p class="calibre1">.55  People  eagerly  adopted  these  and  other  "ineffective  techniques  to allay anxiety when effective ones were not available." 56</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Two Wrongs to Make a Rite</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">People were so firmly convinced of the miraculous qualities attaching to the relics of saints that the death of any notably pious person frequently occasioned  a  mad  rush  to  divide  up  the  body.  After  Thomas  Aquinas died  in  the  monastery  of  Fossanuova,  the  monks  there  decapitated  and boiled his body in order to secure control of his bones. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  St.  Elizabeth  of  Hungary  was  lying  in  state,  "a  crowd  of worshippers came and cut or tore strips of the linen enveloping her face; they cut off the hair, the nails, even the nipples." 57</p>

<p class="calibre1">132</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-134"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Piety Without Virtue</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The medieval mind saw the saints and their relics as part of the arsenal of faith  in  a  world  that  was  colder  in  winter,  darker  at  night,  and  more desperate  in  the  face  of  disease  than  any  reader  of  this  book  will  have been  likely  to  know.  More  emphatically  than  in  the  modern  period, people  in  the  Middle  Ages  believed  that  demons  were  real,  that  God actively  intervened  in  the  world,  and  that  prayer,  penance,  and pilgrimages earned divine favor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To  say  simply  that  people  believed  in  God  could  convey  neither  the intensity of their adherence nor the apparent ease with which medieval piety seemed to bed down 83</p>

<p class="calibre1">with  sin.  Belief  in  the  efficacy  of  rites,  rituals,  and  sacraments  was  so pervasive that it perhaps inevitably undercut the urgency of behaving in a  virtuous  way.  For  any  sin  or  spiritual  defect  there  was  a  remedy,  a penance that would clear the slate, in what came to be a "mathematics of salvation."  58  Religion  became  so  all-pervasive  that  its  sincerity necessarily  began  to  flag.  As  Huizinga  put  it,  "Religion  penetrating  all relations in life means a constant blending of the spheres of holy and of profane  thought.  Holy  things  will  become  too  common  to  be  deeply felt."59 And so it was. </p>

<p class="calibre1">133</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-135"></a><b class="calibre4">DOWNSIZING THE CHURCH</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">By the end of the fifteenth century, the Church was not only as corrupt as the nationstate today; it was also a major drag on economic growth. The Church  engrossed  large  amounts  of  capital  in  unproductive  ways, imposing  burdens  that  limited  the  output  of  society  and  suppressed commerce. These burdens, like those imposed by the nationstate today, were  numerous.  We  know  what  happened  to  organized  religion  in  the wake  of  the  Gunpowder  Revolution:  it  created  strong  incentives  to downsize  religious  institutions  and  lower  their  costs.  When  the traditional  Church  declined  to  do  this,  Protestant  sects  seized  the opportunity to compete. In so doing they employed almost every device imaginable to reduce the cost of living a pious life:</p>

<p class="calibre1">•  They  built  spare  new  churches  and  sometimes  stripped  the  altars  of older ones to free capital for other uses. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  They  revised  Christian  doctrine  in  ways  that  lowered  costs, emphasizing faith over good deeds as a key to salvation.T</p>

<p class="calibre1">• They developed a new, terse liturgy, pared or eliminated feast days, and abolished numerous sacraments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  They  closed  monasteries  and  nunneries,  and  stopped  giving  alms  to mendicant orders. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Poverty went from being an apostolic virtue to an unwelcome and often blameworthy social problem.60</p>

<p class="calibre1">To  understand  how  downsizing  the  Church  liberated  productivity,  you have  to  review  the  many  ways  that  the  Church  stood  in  the  way  of growth  before  its  monopoly  was  broken.  Much  as  the  nationstate  does today,  the  Church  at  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  imposed  an incredible burden of excess costs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">134</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-136"></a>Direct  costs  such  as  tithes,  taxes,  and  fees  fed  the  overgrown ecclesiastical  bureaucracy.  Tithes  were  common  to  Protestant  churches that replaced the medieval "Holy Mother Church" also, but they tended not  to  be  collectible  in  urban  areas.  In  effect,  the  end  of  the  Church's monopoly  led  to  declining  marginal  tax  rates  in  regions  with  the  most highly developed commerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Religious  doctrines  made  saving  difficult.  The  arch-villain  of  the medieval Church was the "miser," the person who saved his gold at the risk  of  his  soul.  The  requirement  for  the  faithful  to  fund  "good  deeds" </p>

<p class="calibre1">entailed  costly  contributions  to  the  Church.  The  doctrine  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"satisfactions" obliged those concerned about salvation to endow masses or "chantries" in order to avoid purgatory. Luther attacked this directly in 84</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  eighth  and  thirteenth  of  his  ninety-five  theses.  He  wrote  that  "the dying  will  pay  all  their  debts  by  their  death."  61  In  other  words,  the capital  of  the  Protestant  believer  was  available  to  pass  on  to  his  heirs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  Protestant  doctrine,  there  was  no  need  to  endow  chantries  to repeat  masses,  usually  for  thirty  years,  and  sometimes,  for  the  very wealthy, in perpetuity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  ideology  of  the  medieval  Church  also  encouraged  diversion  of capital  into  acquisition  of  relics.  Numerous  relic  cults  were  endowed with  large  sun's  to  acquire  physical  objects  associated  with  Christ  or various saints. The very wealthy even assembled personal collections of relics.  For  example,  the  Elector  Frederick  of  Saxony  amassed  a collection of nineteen thousand relics, some acquired on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem  in  1493.  His  collection  included  what  he  believed  to  be  'the body of a holy innocent, Mary's milk, and straw from the stable of the Nativity."  62  Presumably,  the  return  on  capital  invested  in  these  relics was  low.  The  shift  to  an  emphasis  on  faith  and  the  notion  of  the  elect downgraded the importance of acquisition of the trappings of Christian life  for  use  as  charms  and  encouraged  money  to  find  more  productive channels that paid a return that the monarch could tap. </p>

<p class="calibre1">135</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-137"></a>4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  advent  of  Protestant  denominations  broke  the  medieval  Church's economic monopolies, and led to a significant weakening of regulation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  have  seen,  canon  law  was  frequently  bent  to  support  Church monopolies and commercial interests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because the new denominations had fewer economic interests to protect and promote, their version of religious doctrine tended to result in a freer system, with fewer inhibitions of commerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Protestant revolution abolished many of the rites and rituals of the medieval  Church  that  burdened  the  time  of  the  faithful.  Rites, sacraments,  and  holy  days  had  been  elaborated  to  absorb  almost  the entire  calendar  by  the  late  fifteenth  century.  This  ceremonial  overload was  a  logical  outgrowth  of  the  Church's  insistence  '..that  one  could multiply acts of prayer or worship as often as one liked and gain benefits from them."63</p>

<p class="calibre1">Multiply they did. Productivity was taxed by longer and more elaborate services,  obligations  to  recite  repetitious  prayers  in  penance,  and  the proliferation of feast days of saints during which no work could be done. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Numerous  regulations  and  ceremonies  punctuated  the  day  and  the seasons, considerably shrinking the time available for productive tasks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This may have done little to interrupt the rhythms of medieval farming, in which 90 percent or more of the population was engaged. There were many periods during the seasons when field labor was not required on a daily  basis.  The  yield  of  crops  under  medieval  conditions  probably varied more with the weather and uncontrollable rhythms of infestation than from any marginal addition of labor beyond the minimum that the Church calendar accommodated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The larger problem of lost productivity did not fall so much in farming as in other areas. The Church's demands on time were far less compatible with  craft  work,  manufacturing,  transport,  commerce,  or  any  other undertaking  where  productivity  and  profitability  were  likely  to  be crucially determined by the amount of time devoted to the task. </p>

<p class="calibre1">136</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-138"></a>It  may  not  be  a  coincidence  that  the  great  transition  at  the  end  of  the fifteenth century occurred at a time when land rents were rising and real wages for the peasantry 85</p>

<p class="calibre1">were  in  decline.  Increased  population  pressures  had  reduced  the  yield from  the  common  lands,  often  found  surrounding  rivers  and  streams, upon  which  peasants  depended  to  graze  their  livestock,  and  in  some cases,  for  fish  and  firewood.  The  whittling  down  of  living  standards placed  increasingly  urgent  pressures  on  peasants  to  find  alternative sources of income. As a result, "more and more of the rural population turned to small-scale manufacturing for the market, above all in textiles, in the process known as 'putting-out' or 'proto-industrialization.' "64 The ceremonial burdens on time imposed by the Church stood in the way of efforts  by  the  more  ambitious  peasants  to  supplement  their  farming income  by  craft  work,  as  indeed  they  inhibited  any  redeployment  of effort in new economic directions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One of the more pronounced contributions that Protestant sects made to productivity was the scrapping of forty feast days. This not only saved the  considerable  costs  of  staging  the  festivals,  including  outfitting  the village tables with food and drink; it also freed a great deal of valuable time. Implicitly, everyone who stopped honoring the forty banished feast days  could  add  three  hundred  man-hours  or  more  to  his  annual productivity.  In  short,  the  scrapping  of  ceremonial  overload  in  the medieval  Church  opened  the  way  for  an  appreciable  increase  in  output simply by freeing time that would otherwise have been lost to commerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">6. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  break  in  the  Church's  monopoly  disgorged  vast  amounts  of  assets that  were  yielding  low  returns  under  Church  management-a  situation with obvious parallels to state holdings late in the twentieth century. The Church  was  the  largest  feudal  landholder  by  far.  Its  grip  on  the  land matched that of the state in highly politicized societies today-exceeding 50 percent of the total in some European countries such as Bohemia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">According to canon law, once a property came under the control of the Church,  it  could  not  be  alienated.  Thus  the  holdings  of  Church  land tended  steadily  to  rise,  as  the  Church  received  more  and  more 137</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-139"></a>testamentary gifts from the faithful for financing various social welfare services, chantries, and other activities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While  it  is  difficult  to  measure  precisely  the  relative  productivity  of Church  holdings,  it  must  have  been  far  lower  at  the  end  of  the  Middle Ages  than  it  was  in  the  early  part  of  that  epoch.  By  the  fourteenth century, increased emphasis upon production for the market rather than subsistence  farming  had  led  most  lay  lords  to  turn  from  illiterate headmen  to  professional  managers  to  optimize  the  output  of  their holdings. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  incentives  probably  led  them  to  quickly  outstrip  the  output  of Church  properties,  which  in  theory  usually  did  not  accrue  to  anyone's private  profit.  No  doubt  some  of  the  more  worldly  prince-bishops husbanded their estates in ways indistinguishable from those of the lay lords. Yet the productivity of other Church properties would surely have suffered  from  failures  of  indifferent  management  by  a  huge,  far-flung institution, whose drawbacks would have been similar to the drawbacks of state and communal ownership today. It is obvious, as well, that the seizure  of  the  monasteries  rearrayed  resources  that  were  no  longer needed for the reproduction of books and manuscripts after the advent of the printing press. </p>

<p class="calibre1">7. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  detailed  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>-  some  of  the  Protestant  sects immediately  responded  to  the  Gunpowder  Revolution  by  altering  their doctrines  in  ways  that  encouraged  commerce,  such  as  by  lifting  the injunction against usury, or lending at 86</p>

<p class="calibre1">interest. The ideological opposition of the medieval Church to capitalism was a drag on growth. The main ideological thrust of Church teachings was to reinforce feudalism, in which the Church had a large stake, as the largest feudal landholder. Consciously, or not, the Church tended to make religious  virtues  of  its  own  economic  interests,  while  militating  against the  development  of  manufacturing  and  independent  commercial  wealth that  were  destined  to  destabilize  the  feudal  system.  Injunctions  against</p>

<p class="calibre1">"avance," for example, applied mainly to commercial transactions rather than  feudal  levies,  and  never  to  the  sale  of  indulgences.  The  infamous 138</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-140"></a>attempts by the Church to fix a "just price" for items in commerce tended to suppress economic returns on those products and services where the Church itself was not a producer. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The ban on "usury" was a signal example of the Church's resistance to commercial  innovation.  Banking  and  credit  were  crucial  to  the development  of  larger-scale  commercial  enterprises.  By  restricting  the availability of credit, the Church retarded growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">8</p>

<p class="calibre1">More  subtly,  the  new  denominations'  focus  upon  the  Bible  as  a  text helped  demolish  the  medieval  Church's  mode  of  thought  as  well  as  its ideology.  Both  placed  obstacles  in  the  way  of  growth.  The  cultural programming  of  the  late  Middle  Ages  encouraged  people  to  see  the world in terms of symbolic similitude rather than cause and effect. This short-circuited  reasoning.  It  also  pointed  away  from  a  mercantile conception of life. Thinking in terms of symbolic equivalences does not easily  translate  into  thinking  in  terms  of  market  values.  "The  three estates  represent  the  qualities  of  the  Virgin.  The  seven  electors  of  the Empire signify the virtues; the five towns of Artois and Hainault, which in  1477  remained  faithful  to  the  house  of  Burgundy,  are  the  five  wise virgins. . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the same way shoes mean care and diligence, stockings perseverance, the  garter  resolution,  etc."65  As  this  example  quoted  from  the distinguished medieval historian Johan Huizinga suggests, thinking was dominated by dogma, rigid symbols, and allegory that tied together every aspect  of  life  in  terms  of  hierarchic  subordination.  Every  occupation, every  part,  every  color,  every  number,  even  every  element  of  grammar was tied into a grand system of religious conceptions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thus the mundane bits and pieces of life were interpreted not in terms of their  causal  connections,  but  in  terms  of  static  symbols  and  allegories. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  personifying  virtues  and  vices,  each  thing  stood  for something,  which  stood  for  something  else  again,  in  ways  that  often blocked rather than clarified cause and effect. </p>

<p class="calibre1">139</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-141"></a>To  confuse  matters  further,  relationships  were  often  arbitrarily  bound together in systems of numbers. Sevens played a particularly important role.  There  were  the  seven  virtues,  the  seven  deadly  sins,  the  seven supplications of the Lord's Prayer, the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven  moments  of  the  passion,  the  seven  beatitudes,  and  the  seven sacraments, "represented by the seven animals and followed by the seven diseases." 66</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Fifteenth-Century Journalism</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">A  fifteenth-century  news  story,  if  it  had  been  written,  would  not  have answered any of the classic questions of reporting facts, except indirectly through allegoric 87</p>

<p class="calibre1">personification.  Consider  this  report,  in  a  private  diary,  of  the Burgundian murders in fifteenth-century Paris:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Then  arose  the  goddess  of  Discord,  who  lived  in  the  tower  of  Evil Counsel, and awoke Wrath, the mad woman, and Covetousness and Rage and Vengeance, and they took up arms of all sorts and cast out Reason, Justice,  Remembrance  of  God,  and  Moderation  most  shamefully.  Then Madness them enraged, and Murder and Slaughter killed, cut down, put to death, massacred all they found in the prisons. </p>

<p class="calibre1">. . . and Covetousness tucked up her skirts into her belt with Rapine, her daughter, and Larceny, her son. . . . Afterward, the aforesaid people went by guidance of their goddesses, that is to say, Wrath, Covetousness, and Vengeance, who led them through all the public prisons of Paris, etc.67</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  shift  away  from  the  medieval  paradigm  helped  prepare  people  to think in "modern" terms about cause and effect, rather than in terms of symbolic  linkages  and  allegoric  personification.  It  is  not  necessary  to argue that the doctrine and mode of thinking of the late-medieval Church were  insincere  to  see  that  they  tended  to  fit  closely  with  the  needs  of agrarian feudalism, while allowing very little place for commerce, much less  industrial  development.  It  was  rather  a  case  of  the  Church  as  a predominant institution shaping moral, cultural, and legal constraints in ways  that  were  closely  fitted  to  the  imperatives  of  feudalism.  For  this very reason, they were ill-suited to the needs of industrial society, just as 140</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-142"></a>the  moral,  cultural,  and  legal  constraints  of  the  modern  nationstate  are ill-suited  to  facilitating  commerce  in  the  Information  Age.  We  believe that the state will be revolutionized, just as the Church was, to facilitate the realization of the new potential. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Protestant doctrine that heaven could be attained by faith alone and without  the  benefit  of  endowed  prayers  for  the  dead  was  cast  as  a theological  issue.  Yet  it  was  theology  to  fit  the  economic  realities  of  a new  age.  It  met  the  obvious  need  for  a  more  cost-effective  path  to salvation  at  a  time  when  the  opportunity  costs  of  sinking  additional capital  into  the  bloated  ecclesiastical  bureaucracy  had  suddenly  risen, People  had  minded  less  giving  their  money  to  the  Church  when  there was  no  other  outlet  for  it.  But  when  they  suddenly  saw  the  chance  to make  one  hundred  times  their  capital  financing  a  spice  voyage  to  the East,  or  get  a  lesser,  but  still  promising  sum  of  40  percent  per  annum financing a battalion for the king, they understandably sought the grace of God where their own interests lay. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many merchants and other commoners soon became far richer than their forebears  had  been  under  feudalism.  The  sharp  acceleration  of  living standards  among  the  merchants  and  small  manufacturers  of  the  early-modern  period  was  widely  unpopular  among  those  whose  incomes  and way  of  life  were  collapsing  with  feudalism.  The  weakening  of  the Church's monopoly and the increased megapolitical power of the rich led to  a  sharp  reduction  in  income  redistribution.  The  peasants  and  urban poor  who  were  not  immediate  beneficiaries  of  the  new  system  were bitterly envious of those who were. </p>

<p class="calibre1">88</p>

<p class="calibre1">Huizinga  described  the  prevailing  attitude,  in  what  could  well  be  an important  parallel  with  the  Information  Revolution:  "Hatred  of  rich people,  especially  of  the  new  rich,  who  were  then  very  numerous,  is general."68</p>

<p class="calibre1">An equally striking parallel arose from a tremendous surge in crime. The breakdown of the old order almost always unleashes a surge in crime, if not the outright anarchy of the feudal revolution we explored in the last chapter. At the end of the Middle Ages, crime also skyrocketed as the old 141</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-143"></a>systems  of  social  control  broke  down.  In  Huizinga's  words,  "[C]rime came  to  be  regarded  as  a  menace  to  order  and  society."69  It  could  be equally menacing in the future. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The modern world was born in the confusion of new technologies, new ideas,  and  the  stench  of  black  powder.  Gunpowder  weapons  and improved  shipping  destabilized  the  military  foundation  of  feudalism, even  as  new  communications  technology  undermined  its  ideology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Among  the  elements  that  the  new  technology  of  printing  helped  reveal was the corruption of the Church, whose hierarchy as well as rank and file  were  already  held  in  low  regard  by  a  society  that  paradoxically placed religion at the center of everything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  paradox  with  an  obvious  contemporary  parallel  in  the disillusionment with politicians and bureaucrats, in a society that places politics at the center of everything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  was  a  time  of  disillusion,  confusion, pessimism, and despair. A time much like now. </p>

<p class="calibre1">143</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-145"></a><b class="calibre4">THE RUBBLE OF HISTORY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">On November 9 and 10, 1989, television broadcast to the world scenes of exuberant  East  Berliners  dismantling  the  Berlin  Wall  with sledgehammers.  Fledgling  entrepreneurs  among  the  crowd  picked  up pieces of the wall that were later marketed to capitalists far and wide as souvenir  paperweights.  A  brisk  business  in  these  relics  was  done  for years thereafter. Even as we write, one can still encounter occasional ads in small magazines offering bits of old East German concrete for sale at prices  ordinarily  commanded  by  highgrade  silver  ore.  We  believe  that those who bought the Berlin Wall paperweights should be in no rush to sell.  They  hold  mementos  of  something  bigger  than  the  collapse  of Communism. We believe that the Berlin Wall became the most important pile of historical rubble since the walls of San Giovanni were blasted to smithereens almost five centuries earlier in February 1495. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The leveling of San Giovanni by the French king Charles VIII was the first blast of the Gunpowder Revolution. It marked the end of the feudal phase of history and the advent of industrialism, as we outlined earlier. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  destruction  of  the  Berlin  Wall  marks  another  historical  watershed, the  passage  between  the  Industrial  Age  and  the  new  Information  Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Never  has  there  been  so  great  a  symbolic  triumph  of  efficiency  over power. When the walls of San Giovanni fell, it was a stark demonstration that the economic returns to violence in the world had risen sharply. The fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  says  something  different,  namely  that  returns  to violence are now falling. This is something that few have even begun to recognize, but it will have dramatic consequences. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For reasons we explore in this chapter, the Berlin Wall may prove to be far  more  symbolic  of  the  whole  era  of  the  industrial  nationstate  than those in the crowd that night in Berlin or the millions watching from a distance  understood.  The  Berlin  Wall  was  built  to  a  very  different purpose than the walls of San Giovanni-to prevent people on the inside from  escaping  rather  than  to  prevent  predators  on  the  outside  from entering. That fact alone is a telling indicator of the rise in the power of the state from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries. And in more ways than one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">144</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-146"></a>90</p>

<p class="calibre1">For  centuries,  the  nationstate  made  all  outward-facing  walls  redundant and  unnecessary.  The  level  of  monopoly  that  the  state  exercised  over coercion  in  those  areas  where  it  first  took  hold  made  them  both  more peaceful internally and more formidable militarily than any sovereignties the world had seen before. The state used the resources extracted from a largely  disarmed  population  to  crush  small-scale  predators.  The nationstate  became  history's  most  successful  instrument  for  seizing resources.  Its  success  was  based  upon  its  superior  ability  to  extract  the wealth of its citizens. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">"Love  It  or  Leave  It"  (Unless  You  Are  Rich)</b>  Before  the  transition from the nationstate to the new sovereignties of the Information Age is complete,  many  residents  of  the  largest  and  most  powerful  Western nationstates,  like  their  counterparts  in  East  Berlin  in  1989,  will  be plotting to find their way out. In a hint of things to come, the president of the United States proposed in 1995</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  enactment  of  an  exit  tax,  a  "Berlin  Wall  for  Capital,"  that  would require  wealthy  Americans  to  pay  a  substantial  ransom  to  escape  with even part of their money. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Clinton's ransom is not only reminiscent of the late East German state's policy  of  treating  its  citizens  as  assets;  it  also  calls  to  mind  the increasingly draconian measures taken to shore up the fiscal position of the  Roman  Empire  in  decline.  This  passage  from  The  Cambridge Ancient History tells the story. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thus began the fierce endeavor of the State to squeeze the population to the  last  drop.  Since  economic  resources  fell  short  of  what  was  needed, the strong fought to secure the chief share for themselves with a violence and unscrupulousness well in keeping with the origin of those in power and with a soldier' accustomed to plunder. The full rigor of the law was let  loose  on  the  population.  Soldiers  acted  as  bailiffs  or  wandered  as secret police through the land Those who suffered most were, of course, the propertied class. It was relatively easy to lay hands on their property, and in an emergency, they were the class from whom something could be extorted most frequently and quickly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">145</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-147"></a>When failing systems have the power to do so, they often impose penal burdens upon those seeking to escape. Again, we quote The Cambridge Ancient History: "If the propertied class buried their money, or sacrificed two-thirds of their estate to escape from a magistracy, or went so far as to give up their whole property in order to get free of the domains rent, and the  non-propertied  class  ran  away,  the  State  replied  by  increasing pressure." This is worth remembering as you plan ahead. The twilight of state systems in the past has seldom been a polite, orderly process. We mentioned  the  nasty  habits  of  Roman  tax  collectors  in  Chapter  2.  The large number agri deserti, or abandoned farms, in Western Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire reflected only a small part of a wider problem. In fact, exactions tended to be relatively mild in Gaul, and in the  frontier  areas  comprise  current-day  Luxembourg  and  Germany.  In Rome's most fertile region, Egypt, where farming was more productive because of irrigation, desertion by owners was an even bigger problem. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The question of whether to attempt escape, the ultimum refugium, as it was known in Latin, became the overriding quandary of almost everyone 91</p>

<p class="calibre1">with property. Records show that "among the common questions which used to be put to an oracle in Egypt three standard types were: 'Am I to become  a  beggar?'  'Shall  I  take  to  flight?'  and  'Is  my  flight  to  be stopped?'  "4  Clinton's  proposal  says  yes.  It  is  an  early  version  of  an obstacle  to  escape  that  is  likely  to  grow  more  onerous  as  the  fiscal resources of the nationstate slip away. Of course, the first U.S. version of an exit barrier is more benign than Erich Honecker's concrete and barbed wire.  It  also  involves  greater  price  sensitivity,  with  the  burden  falling only on "billionaires" with taxable estates above $600,000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  it  was  justified  with  similar  arguments  to  those  once propounded  by  Honecker  in  defense  of  the  late  German  Democratic Republic's most famous public works project. Honecker claimed that the East German state had a substantial investment in would-be refugees. He pointed out that allowing them to leave freely would create an economic disadvantage for the state, which required their efforts in East Germany. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  accept  the  premise  that  people  are  or  ought  to  be  assets  of  the state, Honecker's wall made sense. Berlin without a wall was a loophole to  the  Communists,  just  as  escape  from  U.S.  tax  jurisdiction  was  a 146</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-148"></a>loophole  to  Clinton's  IRS.  Clinton's  arguments  about  escaping billionaires,  aside  from  showing  a  politician's  usual  disregard  for  the integrity of numbers, were similar in kind to Honecker's, but somewhat less logical because the U.S. government, in fact, does not have a large economic investment in wealthy citizens who might seek to flee. It is not a question of their having been educated at state expense and wanting to slip away and practice law somewhere else. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The overwhelming majority of those to whom the exit tax would apply have created their wealth by their own efforts and in spite of, not because of the U.S. government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With the top 1 percent of taxpayers now paying 28.7 percent of the total income tax in the United States, it is not a question of the rich failing to repay any genuine investment the state may have made in their education or economic prosperity. To the contrary. Those who pay most of the bills pay  vastly  more  than  the  value  of  any  benefits  they  receive.  With  an average  annual  tax  payment  exceeding  $125,000,  taxes  cost  the  top  1</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of American taxpayers far more than they now realize. Assuming they could earn even a 10 percent return on the excess tax paid by each over  a  forty-year  period,  each  $5,000  of  annual  excess  tax  payment reduced their net worth by $2.2 million. At a 20 percent rate of return, each $5,000 of excess tax reduces net worth by $44 million. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the millennium approaches, the new megapolitical conditions of the Information  Age  will  make  it  increasingly  obvious  that  the  nationstate inherited from the industrial era is a predatory institution. With each year that passes, it will seem less a boon to prosperity and more an obstacle, one from which the individual will want an escape. It is an escape that desperate governments will be loath to allow. The stability and even the survival of Western welfare states depends upon their ability to continue extracting a huge fraction of the world's total output for redistribution to a  subset  of  voters  in  the  OECD  countries.  This  requires  that  the  taxes imposed upon the most productive citizens of the currently rich countries be priced at supermonopoly rates, hundreds or even thousands of times higher  than  the  actual  cost  of  the  services  that  governments  provide  in return. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-149"></a><b class="calibre4">THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE NATIONSTATE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The fall of the Berlin Wall was not just a visible symbol of the death of Communism. It was a defeat for the entire world system of nationstates and  a  triumph  of  efficiency  and  markets.  The  fulcrum  of  power underlying history has shifted. We believe that the fall of the Berlin Wall in  1989  culminates  the  era  of  the  nationstate,  a  peculiar  two-hundred-year phase in history that began with the French Revolution. States have existed  for  six  thousand  years.  But  before  the  nineteenth  century,  they accounted  for  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  world's  sovereignties.  Their ascendancy began and ended in revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  great  events  of  1789  launched  Europe  on  a  course  toward  truly national  governments.  The  great  events  of  1989  marked  the  death  of Communism  and  an  assertion  of  control  by  market  forces  over  massed power.  Those  two  revolutions,  exactly  two  hundred  years  apart,  define the era in which the nationstate predominated in the Great Power system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Great Powers, in turn, dominated the world, spreading or imposing state systems on even the most remote tribal enclave. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The triumph of the state as the principal vehicle for organizing violence in the world was not a matter of ideology. It was necessitated by the cold logic  of  violence.  It  was,  as  we  like  to  say,  a  megapolitical  event, determined  not  so  much  by  the  wishes  of  theorists  and  statesmen,  or even  by  the  maneuvering  of  generals,  as  by  the  hidden  leverage  of violence, which moved history in the way that Archimedes dreamed of moving the world. States have been the norm for the past two hundred years  of  the  modern  period.  But  in  the  longer  sweep  of  history,  states have been rare. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They have always depended upon extraordinary megapolitical conditions for  their  viability.  Prior  to  the  modern  period,  most  states  were</p>

<p class="calibre1">'...Oriental despotisms," </p>

<p class="calibre1">agricultural  societies  in  deserts  dependent  upon  control  of  irrigation systems for their survival. Even the Roman Empire, through its control of  Egypt  and  North  Africa,  was  indirectly  a  hydraulic  society.  But  not enough of one to survive. Rome, like most premodern states, ultimately lacked  the  capacity  to  compel  adherence  to  the  monopoly  of  violence 148</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-150"></a>that  the  ability  to  starve  people  provides.  The  Roman  state  outside  of Africa  could  not  cut  off  water  for  growing  crops  by  denying unsubmissive  people  access  to  the  irrigation  system.  Such  hydraulic systems supplied more leverage to violence than any other megapolitical configuration  in  the  ancient  economy.  Whoever  controlled  the  water  in these  societies  could  extract  spoils  at  a  level  almost  comparable  to  the percentage of total output absorbed by modern nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Magnitude over Efficiency</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Gunpowder enabled states to expand more easily outside the confines of rice  paddies  and  arid  river  valleys.  The  nature  of  gunpowder  weapons and the character of the industrial economy created great advantages of scale in warfare. This led to high and rising returns to violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  historian  Charles  Tilly  put  it,  "[S]tates  having  the  largest  coercive means tended to win wars; efficiency (the ratio of output to input) came second  to  effectiveness  (total  output)."6  With  governments  mostly organized  on  a  large  scale,  even  the  few  small  sovereignties  that survived, like Monaco or Andorra, needed the recognition of the larger states  to  ensure  their  independence.  Only  big  governments  with  ever-greater command of resources could compete on the battlefield. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The Great Unanswered Question</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">This brings us to one of the great unanswered puzzles of modern history: why the Cold War that came at the conclusion of the Great Power system pitted  as  its  final  contenders  Communist  dictatorships  against  welfare-state democracies. This issue has been so little examined that it actually seemed  plausible  to  many  when  a  State  Department  analyst,  Francis Fukuyama, proclaimed "the end of history" after the Berlin Wall fell. The enthusiastic audience his work elicited took too much for granted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Apparently  neither  the  author  nor  many  others  had  bothered  to  ask  a fundamental  question:  What  common  characteristics  of  state  socialism and  welfare-state  democracies  led  them  to  be  the  final  contenders  for world domination? This is an important issue. </p>

<p class="calibre1">149</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-151"></a>After  all,  dozens  of  contending  systems  of  sovereignty  have  come  and gone  in  the  past  five  centuries,  including  absolute  monarchies,  tribal enclaves,  prince-bishoprics,  direct  rule  by  the  pope,  sultanates,  city-states, and Anabaptist colonies. Today, most people would be surprised to learn that a hospital management company, with its own armed forces, could  rule  a  country  for  centuries.  Yet  something  very  like  that happened.  For  three  hundred  years  after  1228,  the  Teutonic  Knights  of St.  Mary's  Hospital  at  Jerusalem,  later  united  with  the  Knights  of  the Sword  of  Livonia,  ruled  East  Prussia  and  various  territories  in  Eastern Europe,  including  parts  of  Lithuania  and  Poland.  Then  came  the Gunpowder  Revolution.  Within  decades,  the  Teutonic  Knights  were expelled as sovereigns of all their territories and their Grand Master was of no more military importance than a chess champion. Why? Why did so many other systems of sovereignty dwindle to insignificance while the great struggle for world power at the end of the Industrial Age saw mass democracies lined up against state socialist systems? </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Unimpeded Control</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">If  our  theory  of  megapolitics  is  correct,  the  answer  is  easy.  It  is  rather like asking why sumo wrestlers tend to be fat. The answer is that a lean sumo wrestler, however impressive his ratio of strength to weight, cannot compete  with  another  wrestler  who  is  gigantic.  As  Tilly  suggests,  the important  issue  was  "effectiveness  (total  output),"  not  "efficiency  (the ratio of output to input)." In an increasingly violent world, the systems that predominated through five centuries of competition were necessarily those that facilitated the greatest access to resources needed to make war on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">How did this work? In the case of Communism, the answer is obvious. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  Communism,  those  who  controlled  the  state  controlled  almost everything. If you had 94</p>

<p class="calibre1">been a citizen of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the KGB could have  taken  your  toothbrush  if  they  had  thought  it  useful  for  their purposes  to  do  so.  They  could  have  taken  your  teeth.  According  to credible estimates that have become more credible since the opening of former Soviet archives in 1992, secret police and other agents of the late Soviet state took the lives of 50 million persons in seventy-four years of 150</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-152"></a>rule.  The  state  socialist  system  was  in  a  position  to  mobilize  anything that  existed  within  its  boundaries  for  its  military,  with  little  likelihood that anyone living there would argue. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  case  of  Western  democracies,  the  story  is  less  obvious,  partly because  we  are  accustomed  to  think  of  democracy  in  stark  contrast  to Communism.  In  terms  of  the  Industrial  Age,  the  two  systems  were indeed great opposites. But seen from the perspective of the Information Age, the two systems had more in common than you might suspect. Both facilitated  unimpeded  control  of  resources  by  government.  The difference  was  that  the  democratic  welfare  state  placed  even  greater resources in the hands of the state than the state socialist systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is a clear-cut example of a rare phenomenon, less being more. The state  socialist  system  was  predicated  upon  the  doctrine  that  the  state owned everything. The democratic welfare state, by contrast, made more modest  claims,  and  thereby  employed  superior  incentives  to  mobilize greater  output.  Instead  of  laying  claim  to  everything  in  the  beginning, governments  in  the  West  allowed  individuals  to  own  property  and accumulate  wealth.  Then,  after  the  wealth  had  been  accumulated,  the Western  nationstates  taxed  a  large  fraction  of  it  away.  Property  taxes, income  taxes,  and  estate  taxes  at  high  levels  furnished  the  democratic welfare state with prodigious quantities of resources compared to those available through the state socialist systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Inefficiency,  Where  It  Counted  Compared  to  Communism,  the  welfare state  was  indeed  a  far  more  efficient  system.  But  compared  to  other systems for accumulating wealth, such as a genuine laissez-faire enclave like Hong Kong, the welfare state was inefficient. Again, less was more. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  precisely  this  inefficiency  that  made  the  welfare  state  supreme during the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When you come to understand why, you are much closer to recognizing what  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  and  the  death  of  Communism  really mean.  Far  from  assuring  that  the  democratic  welfare  state  will  be  a triumphant system, as has been widely assumed, it was more like seeing that  a  fraternal  twin  has  died  of  old  age.  The  same  megapolitical revolution  that  killed  Communism  is  also  likely  to  undermine  and 151</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-153"></a>destroy  democratic  welfare  states  as  we  have  known  them  in  the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">WHO CONTROLS GOVERNMENT? </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  key  to  this  unorthodox  conclusion  lies  in  recognizing  where  the control of democratic government is lodged. It is an issue that is not as simple as it may seem. In the modern era, the question of who controls the government has almost always been asked as a political question. It has had many answers, but almost uniformly these involved identifying the  political  party,  group,  or  faction  that  dominated  the  control  of  a particular state at a particular moment. You have heard of governments controlled by 95</p>

<p class="calibre1">capitalists. Governments controlled by labor. Governments controlled by Catholics,  and  by  Islamic  fundamentalists.  Governments  controlled  by tribal  and  racial  groups;  governments  controlled  by  Hutus  and governments by whites. You have also heard of governments controlled by occupational groups, such as lawyers or bankers. You have heard of governments  controlled  by  rural  interests,  by  big-city  machines  and  by people living in the suburbs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And  you  have  certainly  heard  of  governments  controlled  by  political parties,  by  Democrats,  Conservatives,  Christian  Democrats,  Liberals, Radicals, Republicans, and Socialists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But you probably have not heard much about a government controlled by its customers. Economic historian Frederic Lane laid the basis for a new way  of  understanding  where  the  control  of  government  lies  in  some  of his  lucid  essays  on  the  economic  consequences  of  violence  discussed earlier.  Thinking  about  government  as  an  economic  unit  that  sells protection  led  Lane  to  analyze  the  control  of  government  in  economic rather than political terms. In this view, there are three basic alternatives in  the  control  of  government,  each  of  which  entails  a  fundamentally different set of incentives: proprietors, employees, and customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Proprietors</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">152</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-154"></a>In  rare  cases,  even  today,  governments  are  sometimes  controlled  by  a proprietor,  usually  a  hereditary  leader  who  for  all  intents  and  purposes owns  the  country.  For  example,  the  Sultan  of  Brunei  treats  the government  of  Brunei  somewhat  like  a  proprietorship.  This  was  more common  among  lords  of  the  Middle  Ages,  who  treated  their  fiefs  as proprietorships to optimize their incomes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  described  the  incentives  of  "the  owners  of  the  production-producing  enterprise"  as  follows:  An  interest  in  maximizing  profits would lead him, while maintaining prices, to try to reduce his costs. He would, like Henry VII of England or Louis XI of France, use inexpensive wiles,  at  least  as  inexpensive  devices  as  possible,  to  affirm  his legitimacy,  to  maintain  domestic  order,  and  to  distract  neighboring princes so that his own military expenses would be low. From lowered costs, or from the increased exactions made possible by the firmness of his  monopoly,  or  from  a  combination,  he  accumulated  a  surplus  7</p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments controlled by proprietors have strong incentives to reduce the  costs  of  providing  protection  or  monopolizing  violence  in  a  given area.  But  so  long  as  their  rule  is  secure,  they  have  little  incentive  to reduce  the  price  (tax)  they  charge  their  customers  below  the  rate  that optimizes  revenues.  The  higher  the  price  a  monopolist  can  charge,  and the lower his actual costs, the greater the profit he will make. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  ideal  fiscal  policy  for  a  government  controlled  by  its  proprietors would  be  a  huge  surplus.  When  governments  can  keep  their  revenues high but cut their costs, this has a large impact on the use of resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Labor  and  other  valuable  inputs  that  would  otherwise  be  wasted providing  unnecessarily  expensive  protection  become  available  instead for investment and other purposes. The higher the monarch can raise his profit by lowering costs, the more 96</p>

<p class="calibre1">resources are freed. When these resources are used for investment, they provide a stimulus for growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But even if they are used for conspicuous consumption, they help create and feed new markets that otherwise would not exist if the resources had been wasted to produce inefficient "protection." Employees It is easy to characterize  the  incentives  that  prevail  for  governments  controlled  by 153</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-155"></a>their  employees.  They  would  be  similar  incentives  in  other  employee-controlled organizations. First and foremost, employee-run organizations tend to favor any policy that increases employment and oppose measures which  reduce  jobs.  As  Lane  put  it,  "When  employees  as  a  whole controlled, they had little interest in minimizing the amounts exacted for protection and none in minimizing that large part of costs represented by labor  costs,  by  their  own  salaries.  Maximizing  size  was  more  to  their taste  also."  A  government  controlled  by  its  employees  would  seldom have  incentives  to  either  reduce  the  costs  of  government  or  the  price charged  to  their  customers.  However,  where  conditions  impose  strong price resistance, in the form of opposition to higher taxes, governments controlled by employees would be more likely to let their revenues fall below  their  outlays  than  to  cut  their  outlays.  In  other  words,  their incentives  imply  that  they  may  be  inclined  toward  chronic  deficits,  as governments controlled by proprietors would not be customers Are there examples of governments controlled by their customers? Yes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  was  inspired  to  analyze  the  control  of  government  in  economic terms  by  the  example  of  the  medieval  merchant  republics,  like  Venice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  a  group  of  wholesale  merchants  who  required  protection effectively controlled the government for centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  were  genuinely  customers  for  the  protection  service  government provided, not proprietors. They paid for the service. They did not seek to profit from their control of government's monopoly of violence. If some did, they were prevented from doing so by the other customers for long periods  of  time.  Other  examples  of  governments  controlled  by  their customers  include  democracies  and  republics  with  limited  franchise, such as the ancient democracies, or the American republic in its founding period. At that time, only those who paid for the government, about 10</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of the population, were allowed to vote. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  controlled  by  their  customers,  like  those  of  proprietors, have incentives to reduce their operating costs as far as possible. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  unlike  governments  controlled  by  either  proprietors  or  employees, governments  actually  controlled  by  their  customers  have  incentives  to hold  down  the  prices  they  charge.  Where  customers  rule,  governments are  lean  and  generally  unobtrusive,  with  low  operating  costs,  minimal 154</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-156"></a>employment,  and  low  taxes.  A  government  controlled  by  its  customers sets tax rates not to optimize the amount the government can collect but rather to optimize the amount that the customers can retain. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like  typical  enterprises  in  competitive  markets,  even  a  monopoly controlled  by  its  customers  would  be  compelled  to  move  toward efficiency. It would not be able to charge a price, in the form of taxes, that exceeded costs by more than a bare margin. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE ROLE OF DEMOCRACY: VOTERS AS EMPLOYEES AND</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">CUSTOMERS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">97</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane treats democracy in the conventional way in assuming that it brings violence-using  and  violence-producing  enterprises  "increasingly  under the control of their customers." q This is certainly the politically correct conclusion.  But  is  it  true?  We  think  not.  Look  closely  at  how  modern democracies function. </p>

<p class="calibre1">First of all, they have few characteristics of those competitive industries where  the  terms  of  trade  are  clearly  controlled  by  their  customers.  For one thing, democratic governments typically spend only a bare fraction of  their  total  outlays  on  the  service  of  protection,  which  is  their  core activity. In the United States, for example, state and local governments spend just 3.5 percent of their total outlays on the provision of police, as well  as  courts  and  prisons.  Add  military  spending,  and  the  fraction  of revenues  devoted  to  protection  is  still  only  about  10  percent.  Another revealing hint that mass democracy is not controlled by its customers is the fact that contemporary political culture, inherited from the Industrial Age,  would  consider  it  outrageous  if  policies  on  crucial  issues  were actually  informed  by  the  interests  of  the  people  who  pay  the  bills. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Imagine  the  uproar  if  a  U.S.  president  or  a  British  prime  minister proposed to allow the group of citizens who pay the majority of the taxes to determine which programs of government should continue and which groups  of  employees  should  be  fired.  This  would  deeply  offend expectations of how government should operate, in a way that allowing government employees to determine whose taxes should be raised would not. </p>

<p class="calibre1">155</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-157"></a>Yet  when  you  think  about  it,  when  customers  really  are  in  the  driver's seat it would be considered outrageous that they should not get what they want. If you went into a store to buy furniture, and the salespeople took your  money  but  then  proceeded  to  ignore  your  requests  and  consult others about how to spend your money, you would quite rightly be upset. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You would not think it normal or justifiable if the employees of the store argued that you really did not deserve the furniture, and that it should be shipped instead to someone whom they found more worthy. The fact that something  very  like  this  happens  in  dealings  with  government  shows how little control its "customers" </p>

<p class="calibre1">actually have. </p>

<p class="calibre1">By any measure, the costs of democratic government have surged out of control,  unlike  the  typical  situation  where  customer  preferences  force vendors to be efficient. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most  democracies  run  chronic  deficits.  This  is  a  fiscal  policy characteristic  of  control  by  employees.  Governments  seem  notably resistant to reducing the costs of their operations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An  almost  universal  complaint  about  contemporary  government worldwide is that political programs, once established, can be curtailed only  with  great  difficulty.  To  fire  a  government  employee  is  all  but impossible. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  one  of  the  principal  advantages  arising  from  privatization  of formerly  state-owned  functions  is  that  private  control  usually  makes  it far  easier  to  weed  out  unnecessary  employment.  From  Britain  to Argentina,  it  has  not  been  uncommon  for  the  new  private  managers  to shed 50-95 percent of former state employees. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Think, as well, of the basis upon which the fiscal terms of government's protection service is priced. For the most part, you would look in vain for hints  of  competitive  influences  on  tax  rates  according  to  which government services are priced. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  the  occasional  debates  about  lowering  taxes  that  have  interrupted normal  political  discourse  in  recent  years  betray  how  far  removed 156</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-158"></a>democratic government has normally 98</p>

<p class="calibre1">been from control by its customers. Advocates of lower taxes sometimes have argued that government revenues would actually increase because rates  previously  had  been  set  so  high  that  they  discouraged  economic activity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  trade-off  they  normally  intended  to  highlight  was  not  competition between jurisdictions but something much more amazing. They did not argue that because tax rates in Hong Kong were only 15 percent, rates in the United States or Germany must be no higher than 15 percent. To the contrary. Tax debates have normally assumed that the trade-off facing the taxpayer was not between doing business in one jurisdiction or doing it in another, but between doing business at penal rates or taking a holiday. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  were  told  that  productive  individuals  subject  to  predatory  taxation would walk away from their in-boxes and go golfing if their tax burdens were not eased. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that such an argument could even arise shows how far removed from  a  competitive  footing  the  protection  costs  imposed  by  democratic welfare states have been. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  terms  of  progressive  income  taxation,  which  emerged  in  every democratic welfare state during the course of the twentieth century, are dramatically  unlike  pricing  provisions  that  would  be  preferred  by customers.  This  can  easily  be  seen  by  comparing  taxation  imposed  to support a monopolistic provision of protection with tariffs for telephone service, which until recently was a monopoly in most places. Customers would  scream  bloody  murder  if  a  telephone  company  attempted  to charge  for  calls  on  the  same  basis  that  income  taxes  are  imposed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Suppose the phone company sent a bill for $50,000 for a call to London, just because you happened to conclude a deal worth $125,000 during a conversation.  Neither  you  nor  any  other  customer  in  his  right  mind would pay it. But that is exactly the basis upon which income taxes are assessed in every democratic welfare state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  you  think  closely  about  the  terms  under  which  industrial democracies have operated, it is more logical to treat them as a form of government controlled by their employees. Thinking of mass democracy 157</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-159"></a>as government controlled by its employees helps explain the difficulty of changing government policy. Government in many respects appears to be run  for  the  benefit  of  employees.  For  example,  government  schools  in most democratic countries seem to malfunction chronically and without remedy.  If  customers  truly  were  in  the  driver's  seat,  they  would  find  it easier to set new policy directions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Those  who  pay  for  democratic  government  seldom  set  the  terms  of government  spending.  Instead,  government  functions  as  a  co-op  that  is both outside of proprietary control and operating as a natural monopoly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Prices bear little relation to costs. The quality of service is generally low compared to that in private enterprise. Customer grievances are hard to remedy. In short, mass democracy leads to control of government by its</p>

<p class="calibre1">"employees."  But  wait.  You  may  be  saying  that  in  most  jurisdictions there  are  many  more  voters  than  there  are  persons  on  the  government payroll. How could it be possible for employees to dominate under such conditions? The welfare state emerged to answer exactly this quandary. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Since  there  were  not  otherwise  enough  employees  to  create  a  working majority,  increasing  numbers  of  voters  were  effectively  put  on  the payroll to receive transfer payments of all kinds. In effect, the recipients of transfer 99</p>

<p class="calibre1">payments  and  subsidies  became  pseudo-government  employees  who were able to dispense with the bother of reporting every day to work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was a result dictated by the megapolitical logic of the industrial age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  the  magnitude  of  coercive  force  is  more  important  than  the efficient deployment of resources, as was the case prior to 1989, it is all but impossible for most governments to be controlled by their customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the example of the late Soviet Union illustrated so well, until a few years ago it was possible for states to exercise great power in the world even  while  wasting  resources  on  a  massive  scale.  When  returns  to violence  are  high  and  rising,  magnitude  means  more  than  efficiency. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Larger entities tend to prevail over smaller ones. Those governments that are  more  effective  in  mobilizing  military  resources,  even  at  the  cost  of wasting  many  of  them,  tend  to  prevail  over  those  that  utilize  resources more efficiently. </p>

<p class="calibre1">158</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-160"></a>Those who pay for democratic government have little to say about how their  money  is  spent.  Instead,  it  functions  as  a  co-op  which  is  both outside of proprietary control, and operating as a natural monopoly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Prices bear little relation to costs. The quality of service is generally low compared to that in private enterprise. Customer grievances are hard to remedy. In short, mass democracy leads to control of government by its</p>

<p class="calibre1">"employees."  Think  what  this  means.  It  inescapably  implies  that  when magnitude means more than efficiency, governments controlled by their customers cannot prevail, and often, cannot survive. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, the entities that will be most effectively militarily are those that commandeer the most resources for war. But governments that  are  truly  controlled  by  their  customers  who  pay  their  bills  are unlikely to have carte blanche to reach into the pockets of everyone to extract resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Customers normally wish to see the prices they pay for any product or service,  including  protection,  lowered  and  kept  under  control.  If  the Western  democracies  had  been  under  customer  control  during  the  Cold War,  that  fact  alone  would  have  made  them  weaker  competitors militarily,  because  it  would  almost  certainly  have  curtailed  the  flow  of resources  into  the  government.  Remember,  where  customers  rule,  both prices and costs should be expected to be under tight control. But this is hardly what happened. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The welfare states were manifestly the winners of the spending contest during the Cold War. Commentators of all stripes cited as a factor in their triumph their ability to spend the Soviet Union into bankruptcy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It is precisely this fact that highlights the way in which the inefficiencies of  democracy  made  it  megapolitically  predominant  during  a  period  of rising returns to violence. Massive military spending, with all its waste, represents a distinctly suboptimal deployment of capital for private gain. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  suggested  earlier  that  while  welfare  states  were  economically efficient as compared to state socialist systems, they are far less efficient for the creation of wealth than laissez-faire enclaves, like Hong Kong. </p>

<p class="calibre1">159</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-161"></a>Ironically, it was this very inefficiency of the democratic welfare state as compared  to  a  more  unencumbered  free-market  system  that  made  it successful-in the megapolitical conditions of industrialism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">100</p>

<p class="calibre1">How  did  inefficiency  fostered  by  democracy  become  a  factor  in  its success during the Age of Violence? The key to unraveling this apparent paradox lies in recognizing two points:</p>

<p class="calibre1">1.  Success  for  a  sovereignty  in  the  modern  period  lay  not  in  creating wealth  but  in  creating  a  military  force  capable  of  deploying overpowering violence against any other state. Money was needed to do that,  but  money  itself  could  not  win  a  battle.  The  challenge  was  not  to create a system with the most efficient economy or the most rapid rate of growth,  but  to  create  a  system  that  could  extract  more  resources  and channel them into the military. By its nature, military spending is an area where the financial returns per se are low or nonexistent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. The easiest way to obtain permission to invest funds in activities with little  or  no  direct  financial  return,  like  tax  payments,  is  to  ask  for permission from someone other than the person whose money is coveted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One  of  the  ways  that  the  Dutch  were  able  to  purchase  Manhattan  for twenty-three  dollars'  worth  of  beads  is  that  the  particular  Indians  to whom  they  made  the  offer  were  not  the  ones  who  properly  owned  it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Getting to yes," </p>

<p class="calibre1">as the marketing people say, is much easier under those terms. Suppose, for example, that as authors of this book we wanted you to pay not its cover price but 40 percent of your annual income for a copy. We would be far likelier to get permission to do so if we asked someone else, and did not have to ask you. In fact, we would be far more persuasive if we could  rely  instead  upon  the  consent  of  several  people  you  do  not  even know. We could hold an ad hoc election, what H. L. Mencken described, with  less  exaggeration  than  he  might  have  thought,  as  "an  advanced auction  of  stolen  goods."  And  to  make  the  example  more  realistic,  we would  agree  to  share  some  of  the  money  we  collected  from  you  with these anonymous bystanders in exchange for their support. </p>

<p class="calibre1">160</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-162"></a>That is the role the modern democratic welfare state evolved to fulfill. It was  an  unsurpassed  system  in  the  Industrial  Age  because  it  was  both efficient and inefficient where it counted. It combined the efficiency of private  ownership  and  incentives  for  the  creation  of  wealth  with  a mechanism  to  facilitate  essentially  unchecked  access  to  that  wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Democracy  kept  the  pockets  of  wealth  producers  open.  It  succeeded militarily during the high-water period of rising returns to violence in the world precisely because it made it difficult for customers to effectively restrict the taxes the government collected or other ways of funding the outlay of resources for the military, such as inflation. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Why Customers Could Not Dominate</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Those who paid for "protection" during the modern period were not in a position  to  successfully  deny  resources  to  the  sovereign,  even  acting collectively,  when  doing  so  would  simply  have  exposed  them  to  being overpowered by other, possibly more hostile states. This was an obvious consideration  during  the  Cold  War.  The  customers,  or  taxpayers,  who bore  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  cost  of  government  in  the  leading Western industrial states were in no position to refuse to pay hefty taxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The result would have been to expose themselves to total confiscation by the  Soviet  Union  or  another  aggressive  group  capable  of  organizing violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Industrialism and Democracy</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Taking a longer view, mass democracy may prove to be an anachronism that will not long survive the end of the Industrial Age. Certainly, mass democracy  and  the  nationstate  emerged  together  with  the  French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, probably as a response to a  surge  in  real  income.  Incomes  had  begun  to  rise  significantly  in Western Europe about 1750, partly as a result of warmer weather. This coincided with a period of technological innovation that displaced skilled jobs  of  artisans  with  equipment  that  could  be  operated  by  unskilled workers, even women and children. </p>

<p class="calibre1">161</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-163"></a>This  new  industrial  equipment  raised  earnings  for  unskilled  workers, making the income distribution more equal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  crucial  trigger  point  of  revolution  may  not  have  been,  as  is  often thought,  the  perverse  idea  that  people  tend  to  revolt  when  conditions improve. More important may be the fact that when incomes had risen to a  certain  level,  it  at  last  became  practical  for  the  early-modern  state  to circumvent the private intermediaries and powerful magnates with whom they  had  previously  bargained  for  resources,  and  move  to  a  system  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"direct  rule"  in  which  a  national  government  dealt  directly  with individual  citizens,  taxing  them  at  ever  higher  rates  and  demanding poorly compensated military service in exchange for provision of various benefits. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  the  emerging  middle  class  soon  had  enough  money  to  tax,  it was no longer essential, as it previously had been, for rulers to negotiate with  powerful  landlords  or  great  merchants  who  were,  as  historian Charles Tilly wrote, "in a position to prevent the creation of a powerful state" that would "seize their assets and cramp their transactions." "It is easy  to  see  why  governments  were  more  successful  in  extracting resources  when  they  dealt  with  millions  of  citizens  individually  rather than  with  a  relative  handful  of  lords,  dukes,  earls,  bishops,  contract mercenaries, free cities, and other semisovereign entities with whom the rulers  of  European  states  were  obliged  to  negotiate  prior  to  the  mid-eighteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rising real incomes allowed governments to adopt a strategy that placed more  resources  under  their  control.  Small  sums  taken  in  taxes  from millions could produce more revenue than larger amounts paid by a few powerful  people.  What  is  more,  the  many  were  far  easier  to  deal  with than  the  few,  who  were  generally  unwilling  to  give  their  money  away and were far better placed to resist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After  all,  the  typical  farmer,  small  merchant,  or  worker  possessed vanishingly  small  resources  as  compared  to  the  state  itself.  It  was  not even  remotely  possible  that  the  typical  private  individual  in  Western Europe  on  the  eve  of  the  French  Revolution  could  have  effectively bargained with the state to reduce his tax rate, or mounted an effective resistance to government plans and policies that threatened his interests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">162</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-164"></a>But  this  is  precisely  what  powerful  private  magnates  had  done  for centuries  and  would  continue  to  do.  They  effectively  resisted  and bargained with rulers, restraining their ability to commandeer resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">102</p>

<p class="calibre1">163</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-165"></a><b class="calibre4">TILLY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  example  of  Poland  in  the  mid-eighteenth  century  illustrates  this perfectly. In 1760, the Polish national army comprised eighteen thousand soldiers. This was a meager force compared to the armies commanded by rulers  of  neighboring  Austria,  Prussia,  and  Russia,  the  least  of  whom could  control  a  standing  army  of  100,000  soldiers.  In  fact,  the  Polish national  army  in  1760  was  small  even  in  comparison  with  other  units under  arms  within  Poland.  The  combined  forces  of  the  Polish  nobility were thirty thousand men.13</p>

<p class="calibre1">If  the  Polish  king  had  been  able  to  interact  directly  with  millions  of individual  Poles  and  tax  them  directly,  rather  than  being  limited  to extracting resources indirectly through the contributions of the powerful Polish magnates, there is little doubt that the Polish central government would have been in a position to raise far more revenues, and thus pay for a larger army. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Against ordinary individuals, who were not in a position to act in concert with  millions  of  other  ordinary  individuals,  the  central  authorities  were to prove irresistibly powerful everywhere. But the king of Poland lacked the option of directly taxing his citizens in 1760. He had to deal through the  lords,  wealthy  merchants,  and  other  notables,  who  were  a  small, cohesive group. They could and did act in concert to keep the king from commandeering  their  resources  without  their  consent.  Given  that  the Polish  nobility  had  far  more  troops  than  he  did,  the  king  was  in  no position to insist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  it  turned  out,  the  military  disadvantage  of  failing  to  circumvent  the wealthy and powerful in gathering resources was decisive in the Age of Violence. Within a few years, Poland ceased to exist as an independent country.  It  was  conquered  by  invasions  from  Austria,  Prussia,  and Russia, three countries with armies each of which was many times bigger than Poland's small force. In each of those countries, the rulers had found paths  to  circumvent  the  capacity  of  the  wealthy  merchants  and  the nobility to limit the commandeering of their resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">After the French Revolution</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">164</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-166"></a>The  French  Revolution  resulted  in  an  even  greater  surge  in  the  size  of armies, a fact that demonstrated the strength of the democratic strategy when  returns  to  violence  were  rising.  The  bargain  governments  struck from  the  French  Revolution  onward  was  to  provide  an  unprecedented degree  of  involvement  in  the  lives  of  average  people,  in  exchange  for their participation in wars in place of mercenaries, and paying a growing burden of taxes from their rising incomes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As Tilly said, The state's sphere expanded far beyond its military core, and  its  citizens  began  to  make  claims  on  it  for  a  very  wide  range  of protection,  adjudication,  production,  and  distribution.  As  national legislatures  extended  their  own  ranges  well  beyond  the  approval  of taxation, they became the targets of claims from all well-103</p>

<p class="calibre1">organized groups whose interests the state did or could affect. Direct rule and  mass  national  politics  grew  up  together,  and  reinforced  each  other mightily.'  4  The  same  logic  that  was  true  in  the  eighteenth  century remained  true  until  1989,  when  the  Berlin  Wall  fell.  As  the  Industrial Age  advanced,  incomes  for  unskilled  work  continued  to  rise,  making mass  democracy  an  even  more  effective  method  of  optimizing  the extraction of resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As a result, government grew and grew, adding about 0.5 percent to its total claims on annual income in the average industrial country over the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">During the Industrial Age prior to 1989, democracy emerged as the most militarily  effective  form  of  government  precisely  because  democracy made  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  impose  effective  limits  on  the commandeering of resources by the state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Generous provision of welfare benefits to one and all invited a majority of  voters  to  become,  in  effect,  employees  of  the  government.  This became  the  predominant  political  feature  of  all  leading  industrial countries  because  voters  were  in  a  weak  position  to  effectively  control the government in their role as customers for the service of protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not  only  did  they  face  the  aggressive  menace  of  Communist  systems, which could produce large resources for military purposes since the state 165</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-167"></a>controlled the entire economy. But true taxpayer control of government was also impractical for another reason. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Millions of average citizens cannot work together effectively to protect their  interests.  Because  the  obstacles  to  their  cooperation  are  high,  and the  return  to  any  individual  for  successfully  defending  the  group's common interests is minimal, millions of ordinary citizens will not be as successful  in  withholding  their  assets  from  the  government  as  will smaller groups with more favorable incentives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Other  things  being  equal,  therefore,  you  would  expect  a  higher proportion  of  total  resources  to  be  commandeered  by  government  in  a mass  democracy  than  in  an  oligarchy,  or  in  a  system  of  fragmented sovereignty  where  magnates  wielded  military  power  and  fielded  their own armies, as they did everywhere in early-modern Europe prior to the eighteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thus  a  crucial  though  seldom  examined  reason  for  the  growth  of democracy in the Western world is the relative importance of negotiation costs  at  a  time  when  returns  to  violence  were  rising.  It  was  always costlier to draw resources from the few than from the many. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  relatively  small,  elite  group  of  rich  represent  a  more  coherent  and effective  body  than  a  large  mass  of  citizens.  The  small  group  has stronger  incentives  to  work  together.  It  will  almost  inevitably  be  more effective at protecting its interests than will a mass group.' 5 And even if most members of the group choose not to cooperate with any common action,  a  few  who  are  rich  may  be  capable  of  deploying  enough resources to get the job done. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With democratic decision-making, the nationstate could exercise power much  more  completely  over  millions  of  persons,  who  could  not  easily cooperate to act collectively in their own behalf, than it could in dealings with  a  much  smaller  number  who  could  more  easily  overcome  the organizational difficulties of defending their concentrated interests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">104</p>

<p class="calibre1">166</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-168"></a>Democracy  had  the  still  more  compelling  advantage  of  creating  a legitimizing  decision  rule  that  allowed  the  state  to  tap  the  resources  of the well-to-do without having to bargain directly for their permission. In short,  democracy  as  a  decision  mechanism  was  well  fitted  to  the megapolitical  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age.  It  complemented  the nationstate  because  it  facilitated  the  concentration  of  military  power  in the  hands  of  those  running  it  at  a  time  when  the  magnitude  of  force brought to bear was more important than the efficiency with which it was mobilized. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  was  demonstrated  decisively  with  the  French  Revolution,  which raised the magnitude of military force on the battlefield. Thereafter, other competitive  nationstates  had  little  choice  but  to  converge  on  a  similar organization,  with  legitimacy  ultimately  tied  to  democratic  decision-making. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To summarize, the democratic nationstate succeeded during the past two centuries for these hidden reasons:</p>

<p class="calibre1">1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There were rising returns to violence that made magnitude of force more important than efficiency as a governing principle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Incomes  rose  sufficiently  above  subsistence  that  it  became  possible  for the  state  to  collect  large  amounts  of  total  resources  without  having  to negotiate with powerful magnates who were capable of resisting. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Democracy  proved  sufficiently  compatible  with  the  operation  of  free markets  to  be  conducive  to  the  generation  of  increasing  amounts  of wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Democracy  facilitated  domination  of  government  by  its  "employees," </p>

<p class="calibre1">thereby  assuring  that  it  would  be  difficult  to  curtail  expenditures, 167</p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Democracy  as  a  decision-rule  proved  to  be  an  effective  antidote  to  the ability of the wealthy to act in concert to restrict the nationstate's ability to tax or otherwise protect their assets from invasion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Democracy became the militarily winning strategy because it facilitated the gathering of more resources into the hands of the state. Compared to other  styles  of  sovereignty  that  depended  for  their  legitimacy  on  other principles,  such  as  the  feudal  levy,  the  divine  right  of  kings,  corporate religious duty, or the voluntary contributions of the rich, mass democracy became militarily the most potent because it was the surest way to gather resources in an industrial economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Nationalism</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Much the same can be said of nationalism, which became a corollary to mass  democracy.  States  that  could  employ  nationalism  found  that  they could mobilize larger 105</p>

<p class="calibre1">armies  at  a  smaller  cost.  Nationalism  was  an  invention  that  enabled  a state  to  increase  the  scale  at  which  it  was  militarily  effective.  Like politics itself, nationalism is mostly a modern invention. As sociologist Joseph Llobera has shown in his richly documented book on the rise of nationalism, the nation is an imagined community that in large measure came  into  being  as  a  way  of  mobilizing  state  power  during  the  French Revolution.  As  he  puts  it,  "In  the  modern  sense  of  the  term,  national 168</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-170"></a>consciousness  has  only  existed  since  the  French  Revolution,  since  the time  when  in  1789  the  Constituent  Assembly  equated  the  people  of France with the French nation." Nationalism made it easier to mobilize power  and  control  large  numbers  of  people.  Nationstates  formed  by underlining and emphasizing characteristics that people held in common, particularly  spoken  language.  This  facilitated  rule  without  the intervention  of  intermediaries.  It  simplified  the  tasks  of  bureaucracy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Edicts that need only be promulgated in one language can be dispatched more quickly and with less confusion than those that must be translated into a Babel of tongues. Nationalism, therefore, tended to lower the cost of  controlling  larger  areas.  Before  nationalism,  the  early-modern  state required  the  aid  of  lords,  dukes,  earls,  bishops,  free  cities,  and  other corporate  and  ethnic  intermediaries,  from  tax  "farmers"  to  military contract merchants and mercenaries to collect revenues, raise troops and conduct other government functions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nationalism  also  decisively  lowered  the  costs  of  mobilizing  military personnel  by  encouraging  group  identification  with  the  interests  of  the state. There was such a substantial advantage in harnessing group feeling to  the  interests  of  the  state  that  most  states,  even  the  allegedly internationalist  Soviet  Union,  converged  on  nationalism  as  a complementary ideology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Seen in a longer perspective, nationalism is as much an anomaly as the state itself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As historian William McNeill has documented, polyethnic sovereignties were  the  norm  in  the  past.  In  McNeill's  words,  "The  idea  that  a government  rightfully  should  rule  only  over  citizens  of  a  single  ethnos started  to  develop  in  Western  Europe  towards  the  end  of  the  Middle Ages." An early nationalist entity was the Prussian League (Preussicher Bund),  which  formed  in  1440  in  opposition  to  rule  by  the  Teutonic Order. Some of the characteristics of the order were highlighted earlier as a polar example of a sovereignty unlike the nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Teutonic  Order  was  a  kind  of  chartered  company  almost  none  of whose  members  were  native  to  Prussia.  Its  headquarters  shifted  at various times from Bremen and Lubeck to Jerusalem to Acre to Venice and on to Marienberg on the Vistula. At one time it ruled the district of 169</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-171"></a>Burzenland  in  Transylvania.  It  is  not  surprising  that  a  sovereignty  so unlike  a  state  would  became  the  object  of  one  of  the  early  attempts  to mobilize national feeling as a factor in organizing power. However, as an indication of how different early nationalism was from later varieties, the German-speaking  nobles  of  the  Prussian  League  petitioned  the  king  of Poland to place Prussia under Polish rule, largely because even then the Polish king was a relatively weak monarch who was not expected to rule with the same rigor as the Teutonic Order. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nationalism,  in  its  early  incarnations,  came  into  play  just  prior  to  the Gunpowder  Revolution.  It  continued  to  develop  as  the  early-modern state developed, taking a quantum leap in importance at the time of the French Revolution. We believe that 106</p>

<p class="calibre1">nationalism as an idea of force has already begun to recede. It probably reached  its  heyday  with  Woodrow  Wilson's  attempt  to  endow  every ethnic group in Europe with its own state at the close of World War I. It is now a reactionary force, inflamed in places with falling incomes and declining prospects like Serbia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As we explore later, we expect nationalism to be a major rallying theme of persons with low skills nostalgic for compulsion as the welfare state collapses in the Western democracies. You haven't seen anything yet. For most persons in the West the fallout from the death of Communism has seemed relatively benign. You have seen a drop in military spending, a plunge in aluminum prices, and a new source of hockey players for the NHL. That is the good news. It is news that most people who came of age in the twentieth century could applaud, especially if they are hockey fans.  Most  of  the  news  that  is  destined  to  prove  less  popular  is  still  to come. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With the passage of the Industrial Age, the megapolitical conditions that democracy satisfied are rapidly ceasing to exist. Therefore, it is doubtful that mass democracy and the welfare state will survive long in the new megapolitical conditions of the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-172"></a>ALBERTO FUJIMORI, president of Peru Indeed, future historians may report that we have already seen the first postmodern  coup-the  remarkable  padlocking  of  the  congress  in  Peru  in 1993. This was hardly an event that attracted much favorable notice in the leading industrial democracies. But it may turn out to mean more in the fullness of time than conventional analysts would suggest. The few who have thought about it tend to see it as just another power grab of the kind  that  has  become  depressingly  familiar  in  the  history  of  Latin America. But we see it as perhaps the first step toward delegitimizing a form of governance whose immediate megapolitical reason for being has begun to disappear with the transition to the Information Age. Fujimori's closure  of  the  congress  is  a  symptom  of  the  ultimate  devaluation  of political  promises.  A  similar  fate  could  await  other  legislatures  when their credit is exhausted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  shift  in  technology  that  is  eroding  industrialism  has  trapped  many countries with governments that no longer work. Or work badly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Legislatures, in particular, appear to be increasingly dysfunctional. They grind out laws that might have been merely stupid fifty years ago but are dangerous today. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This was spectacularly obvious in Peru, where the internal sovereignty of the state had almost collapsed by 1993. </p>

<p class="calibre1">FERNANDO DE SOTO</p>

<p class="calibre1">107</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Peru in Ruins</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">171</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-173"></a>In a sense, Peru was no longer a modern nationstate in 1993. It still had a flag  and  an  army,  but  most  of  its  institutions  lay  in  ruins.  Even  the prisons had been taken over by the inmates. This disintegration could be traced to a number of causes, but most expert attempts to explain it miss the  real  point.  Peru  was  an  early  casualty  of  the  technological  change that is making closed economies dysfunctional and undermining central authority  everywhere.  These  megapolitical  stresses  are  compounded because  decision-making  institutions  like  the  Peruvian  congress  are trapped  by  perverse  incentives  into  aggregating  the  very  problems  that they most need to solve. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Representative  democracy  in  Peru  was  like  a  pair  of  loaded  dice.  As  a decision mechanism for aggrandizing the state, it was unsurpassed. But when new circumstances called for devolving power, the inherent biases that  made  democracy  so  useful  under  the  old  megapolitical  conditions made it increasingly dysfunctional. The very laws passed by the congress were rapidly destroying any foundation of value or respect for the law. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As de Soto put it in  <i class="calibre3">The Other Path</i>, "Small interest groups fight among themselves, cause bankruptcies, implicate public officials. Governments hand out privileges. The law is used to give and take away far more than morality  permits."  21  A  congress  like  that  in  Peru,  entirely  in  thrall  to special-interest  groups,  has  all  the  moral  stature  of  a  gang  of  fences auctioning  off  stolen  goods.  It  made  the  free  market  illegal,  and consequently  made  the  law  ridiculous.  As  de  Soto  writes  of  the  pre-Fujimori  period:  A  complete  subversion  of  ends  and  means  has  turned the life of Peruvian society upside down, to the point that there are acts which,  although  officially  criminal,  are  no  longer  condemned  by  the collective  consciousness.  Smuggling  is  a  case  in  point.  Everyone,  from the aristocratic lady to the humblest man, acquires smuggled goods. No one  has  scruples  about  it;  on  the  contrary,  it  is  viewed  as  a  kind  of challenge to individual ingenuity or as revenge against the state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This infiltration of violence and criminality into everyday life has been accompanied  by  increasing  poverty  and  deprivation.  In  general  terms, Peruvians'  real  average  income  had  declined  steadily  over  the  last  ten years and is now at the level of twenty years ago. Mountains of garbage pile up on all sides. Night and day, legions of beggars, car washers, and scavengers besiege passersby, asking for money. The mentally ill swarm 172</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-174"></a>naked  in  the  streets,  stinking  of  urine.  Children,  single  mothers,  and cripples beg for alms on every corner. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The traditional centralism of our society has proved clearly incapable of satisfying  the  manifold  needs  of  a  country  in  transition.  22  De  Soto described the abandonment of the grotesque legal economy for the black market  that  was  under  way  before  Fujimori  padlocked  the  congress  as</p>

<p class="calibre1">"an invisible revolution." We are positive about the benefits of the free market, but much less positive about the promise of a society in which the law is as degraded as the money. The world that de Soto described in Peru  prior  to  1993  was  a  "Clockwork  Orange"  world,  where  overly centralized  and  dysfunctional  government  institutions  were  literally destroying the civil society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">108</p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  what  Fujimori  set  out  to  change.  He  had  slashed  inflation  by turning  off  the  printing  presses.  He  had  also  managed  to  fire  fifty thousand  government  employees,  and  to  trim  some  subsidies.  He  had made  a  start  toward  balancing  the  budget.  His  program  of  reform included  comprehensive  plans  to  create  free  markets  and  privatize industry.  But  as  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  most  of  the  important elements of Fujimori's reform were yet to be adopted in 1993, including the  first  round  of  large-scale  privatization  of  state  banks,  mining companies,  and  utilities.  Instead  of  enacting  these  necessary  proposals, Peru's  congress,  like  the  Russian  congress  that  challenged  Yeltsin's reforms  in  Moscow,  sought  to  move  backwards.  Their  plan:  restore subsidies from an empty treasury, pad the payroll, and protect any and all vested  interests,  especially  the  bureaucracy-exactly  what  you  would expect of a government controlled by its employees. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Fujimori claimed that the congress of Peru was dithering and corrupt, a fact  with  which  almost  everyone  agreed.  He  further  claimed  that congressional  dithering  and  corruption  made  it  impossible  to  reform Peru's collapsing economy or combat a violent assault by narco-terrorists and nihilistic Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-175"></a>So Fujimori closed the Congress, an act that might have indicated that he was  as  authoritarian  as  many  earlier  Latin  American  leaders.  But  we thought, and said so at the time, that Fujimori had correctly identified a fundamental impediment to reform. The extravagant official elegies for the Peruvian congress by American editorial writers and officials of the State  Department  were  not  shared  by  the  people  of  Peru.  While  North Americans  carried  on  as  if  Peru's  congress  were  the  incarnation  of freedom  and  civilization,  the  Peruvian  people  cheered.  President Fujimori's popularity shot up above 70 percent when he sent the congress home. And he was later reelected to a second term in a landslide. Most citizens  apparently  saw  their  legislature  more  as  an  obstacle  to  their wellbeing than as an expression of their rights. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We saw Peru's turmoil less as a throwback to the dictatorships of the past than as an early installment of a broader transition crisis. You can expect to see crises of misgovernment in many countries as political promises are deflated and governments run out of credit. </p>

The fall of Communism, which we forecast in 1987 in  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> and even earlier in our monthly newsletter, <i class="calibre3">Strategic Investment</i>,  was  not  merely  the  repudiation  of  an  ideology.

<p class="calibre1">Workers who had been employed to operate the factories sat down in an industrial confrontation that was to last for many weeks.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Extortion and Protection</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Throughout  history,  violence  has  been  a  dagger  pointed  at  the  heart  of the economy. As Thomas Schelling shrewdly put it, "The power to hurt -</p>

<p class="calibre1">to  destroy  things  that  somebody  treasures,  to  inflict  pain  and  grief  is  a kind  of  bargaining  power,  not  easy  to  use  but  used  often.  In  the underworld it is the basis for blackmail, extortion, and kidnapping, in the commercial world, for boycotts, strikes, and lockouts. . . It is often the basis  for  discipline,  civilian  and  military;  and  gods  use  it  to  exact discipline."  3  A  government's  capacity  to  tax  itself  depends  upon  the same  vulnerabilities  as  do  private  shakedowns  and  extortion.  Although we tend not to perceive it in these terms, the proportion of assets that are controlled and spent coercively, through crime and government, provides a  rough  measure  of  the  megapolitical  balance  between  extortion  and protection.  If  technology  made  the  protection  of  assets  difficult,  crime would  tend  to  be  widespread,  and  so  would  union  activity.  Under  such circumstances,  protection  by  government  would  therefore  command  a premium. Taxes would be high. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Where taxes are lower and wage rates in the workplace are determined by  market  forces  rather  than  through  political  intervention  or  coercion, technology has tipped the balance toward protection. The technological imbalance  between  extortion  and  protection  reached  an  extreme  at  the end of the third quarter of the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  some  advanced  Western  societies  more  than  a  majority  of  resources were commandeered by governments. The incomes of a large fraction of the population were either set by fiat or determined under the influence of coercion, such as by strikes and threats of violence in other forms. The welfare  state  and  the  trade  union  were  both  artifacts  of  technology, sharing  the  spoils  of  the  triumph  of  power  over  efficiency  in  the twentieth  century.  They  could  not  have  existed  if  not  for  the technologies,  military  and  civilian,  that  raised  the  returns  to  violence during the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">179</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-181"></a>The  capacity  to  create  assets  has  always  entailed  some  vulnerability  to extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  greater  the  assets  created  or  possessed,  the  higher  the  price  to  be paid, in one way or another. Either you paid off everyone who gained the leverage to employ violence for extortion, or you paid for military power capable of defeating any shakedown attempt by brute force. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Mathematics of Protection</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Now  the  dagger  of  violence  could  soon  be  blunted.  Information technology promises to alter dramatically the balance between protection and  extortion,  making  protection  of  assets  in  many  cases  much  easier, and  extortion  more  difficult.  The  technology  of  the  Information  Age makes  it  possible  to  create  assets  that  are  outside  the  reach  of  many forms  of  coercion.  This  new  asymmetry  between  protection  and extortion 112</p>

<p class="calibre1">rests  upon  a  fundamental  truth  of  mathematics.  It  is  easier  to  multiply than  to  divide.  As  basic  as  this  truth  is,  however,  its  far-reaching consequences  were  disguised  prior  to  the  advent  of  microprocessors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">High-speed  computers  have  facilitated  many  billions  of  times  more computations in the past decade than were undertaken in all the previous history of the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This leap in computation has allowed us for the first time to fathom some of the universal characteristics of complexity. What the computers show is  that  complex  systems  can  be  built  and  understood  only  from  the bottom  up.  Multiplying  prime  numbers  is  simple.  But  disaggregating complexity by trying to decompose the product of large prime numbers is all but impossible. Kevin Kelly, editor of Wired, puts it this way: "To multiply  several  prime  numbers  into  a  larger  product  is  easy;  any elementary school kid can do it. But the world's supercomputers choke while trying to unravel a product into its simple primes." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  cybereconomy  will  inevitably  be  shaped  by  this  profound mathematical truth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It already has an obvious expression in powerful encryption algorithms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  explore  later  in  this  chapter,  these  algorithms  will  allow  the creation  of  a  new,  protected  realm  of  cybercommerce  in  which  the leverage  of  violence  will  be  greatly  reduced.  The  balance  between extortion  and  protection  will  tip  dramatically  in  the  direction  of protection.  This  will  facilitate  the  emergence  of  an  economy  that depends  more  upon  spontaneous  adaptive  mechanisms  and  less  upon conscious decision-making and resource allocation through bureaucracy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The new system in which protection will be at the forefront will be very different from that which arose from the predominance of compulsion in the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Command-and-Control Systems Are Primitive</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  wrote  in   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>  that  the  computer  is  enabling  us  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">"see"  the  formerly  invisible  complexity  inherent  in  a  whole  range  of systems.* Not only does advanced computational capability enable us to better understand the dynamics of complex systems; it also enables us to harness  those  complexities  in  productive  ways.  In  a  sense,  this  is  not even a choice but an inevitability if the economy is to advance beyond the  inflexible  central-control  stage  of  development.  Such  a  system, which  depends  upon  linear  relationships,  is  fundamentally  primitive. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Government  appropriation  of  resources  inevitably  dragoons  resources from high-value complex uses to low-value primitive uses. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It is a process that is limited by the same mathematical asymmetry that prevents the unraveling of the product of large prime numbers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Dividing the spoils can never be anything but primitive. See Chapter 8 of <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Great Reckoning</i>  "Linear  Expectations  in  a  Nonlinear  World:  How the  Telescope  Led  Us  to  Compute;  how  the  Computer  Can  Help  Us  to See."

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-183"></a>they  evolve.  This  is  true  in  astrophysics.  It  is  true  in  a  puddle.  Leave rainwater alone in a low spot and it will grow more complex. Advanced Systems  of  every  variety  are  complex  adaptive  Systems  without  an authority  in  charge.  Every  complex  system  in  nature,  of  which  the market economy is the most evident social manifestation, depends upon dispersed  capabilities.  Systems  that  work  most  effectively  under  the widest range of conditions depend for their resilience upon spontaneous order that accommodates novel possibilities. Life itself is such a complex system.  Billions  of  potential  combinations  of  genes  produce  a  single human  individual.  Sorting  among  them  would  confound  any bureaucracy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Twenty-five years ago, that could only have been an intuition. Today it is demonstrable.  The  closer  computers  bring  us  to  understanding  the mathematics of artificial life, the better we understand the mathematics of real life, which are those of biological complexity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These secrets of complexity, harnessed through information technology, are  allowing  economies  to  be  reconfigured  into  more  complex  forms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Internet  and  the  World  Wide  Web  have  already  taken  on characteristics of an organic system, as Kevin Kelly suggests in  <i class="calibre3">Out of</i> <i class="calibre3">Control:  The  New  Biology  of  Machines,  Social  Systems</i>.  and  the Economic  World.'  In  his  words,  nature  is  "an  idea  factory.  Vital, postindustrial  paradigms  are  hidden  in  every  jungle  ant  hill.  .  .  .  The wholesale  transfer  of  biologic  into  machines  should  fill  us  with  awe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When the union of the born and the made is complete, our fabrications will learn, adapt, heal themselves, and evolve. This is a power we have hardly dreamt of yet." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  consequences  of  the  "wholesale  transfer  of  biologic  into machines" </p>

<p class="calibre1">are bound to be far-reaching. There has always been a strong tendency for social systems to mimic the characteristics of prevailing technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is something that Marx got right. Gigantic factories coincided with the age of big government. Microprocessing is miniaturizing institutions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  our  analysis  is  correct,  the  technology  of  the  Information  Age  will ultimately create an economy better suited to exploit the advantages of complexity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">182</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-184"></a>Yet  the  megapolitical  dimensions  of  such  a  change  are  so  little understood  that  even  most  of  those  who  have  recognized  its mathematical  importance  have  done  so  in  an  anachronistic  way.  It  is simply  difficult  to  grasp  and  internalize  fully  the  likelihood  that technological  change  in  the  next  few  years  will  antiquate  most  of  the political forms and concepts of the modern world. For example, the late physicist  Heinz  Pagels  wrote  in  his  farseeing  book,  <i class="calibre3">The  Dreams  of</i> <i class="calibre3">Reason</i>, "I am convinced that the nations and people who master the new science of Complexity will become the economic, cultural, and political superpowers of the next century." 7 It is an impressive forecast. But we believe  it  is  bound  to  be  wrong,  not  because  it  is  misperceived,  but precisely because it will prove more right than Dr. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pagels dared to express. Societies that reconfigure themselves to become more complex adaptive systems will indeed prosper. But when they do, they are unlikely to be nations, much less -'political superpowers." The more  likely  immediate  beneficiaries  of  increased  complexity  of  social systems will be the Sovereign Individuals of the new millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">114</p>

<p class="calibre1">As Pagels's forecast stands, it is the equivalent to a shaman of a hunting band  of  five  hundred  generations  ago  telling  his  men  as  they  crouched around the campfire, '~1</p>

<p class="calibre1">am  convinced  that  the  first  hunting  band  to  master  the  new  science  of irrigated  planting  will  have  more  free  time  for  storytelling  than  even those guys over at the lake who catch the big fish." As right as he was about  the  importance  of  complexity,  Pagels  overlooked  the  most  basic fact of all. When the logic of violence changes, society changes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">183</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-185"></a><b class="calibre4">THE LOGIC OF VIOLENCE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  see  how  and  why,  it  is  necessary  to  focus  on  several  facets  of megapolitics that are seldom brought to your attention. These are issues that  were  explored  by  historian  Frederic  C.  Lane,  whose  work  on violence and the economic meaning of war is discussed elsewhere in this volume. When Lane wrote in the middle of this century, the In formation Society  was  nowhere  in  sight.  Under  the  circumstances,  he  may  well have supposed that the competition to employ violence in the world had reached its final stage with the appearance of the nationstate. There is no hint in his works that he anticipated microprocessing or believed that it was  technologically  feasible  to  create  assets  in  cyberspace,  a  realm without  physical  existence.  Lane  had  nothing  to  say  about  the implications of the possibility that large amounts of commerce could be made all but immune from the leverage of violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While Lane did not foresee the technological revolutions now unfolding, his insights into the various stages of the monopolization of violence in the past were so lucid that they have obvious application to the emerging Information  Revolution.  Lane's  study  of  the  violent  medieval  world attracted  his  attention  to  issues  that  conventional  economists  and historians have tended to neglect. He saw that how violence is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining what uses are made of scarce resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  also  recognized  that  while  production  of  violence  is  not  usually considered part of economic output, the control of violence is crucial to the  economy.  The  primary  role  of  government  is  to  provide  protection against violence. As he put it, Every economic enterprise needs and pays for protection, protection against the destruction or armed seizure of its capital  and  the  forceful  disruption  of  its  labor.  In  highly  organized societies the production of this utility, protection, is one of the functions of a special association or enterprise called government. Indeed, one of the  most  distinctive  characteristics  of  governments  is  their  attempt  to create  law  and  order  by  using  force  themselves  and  by  controlling through various means the use of force by others." That is a point that is apparently too basic to appear in textbooks, or to form a part of the civic 184</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-186"></a>discussion  that  presumably  determines  the  course  of  politics.  But  it  is also  too  basic  to  ignore  if  you  wish  to  understand  the  unfolding Information  Revolution.  Protection  of  life  and  property  is  indeed  a crucial need that has bedeviled every society that ever existed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">How to fend off violent aggression is history's central dilemma. It cannot easily be solved, notwithstanding the fact that protection can be provided in more than one way. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Close of an Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">115</p>

<p class="calibre1">As we write, the megapolitical consequences of the Information Age are only  beginning  to  be  felt.  The  economic  change  of  recent  decades  has been  from  the  primacy  of  manufactures  to  that  of  information  and computation,  from  machine  power  to  microprocessing,  from  factory  to workstation,  from  mass  production  to  small  teams,  or  even  to  persons working alone. As the scale of enterprise falls, so does the potential for sabotage  and  blackmail  in  the  workplace.  Smaller-scale  operations  are much more difficult to organize by unions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Microtechnology  allows  firms  to  be  smaller,  more  footloose  targets. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  deal  in  services  or  products  with  negligible  natural-resource content.  In  principle,  these  businesses  could  be  conducted  almost anywhere on the planet. They are not trapped at a specific location, like a mine  or  a  port.  Therefore,  in  the  fullness  of  time,  they  will  be  far  less susceptible  to  being  taxed,  either  by  unions  or  by  politicians.  An  old Chinese  folk  wisdom  holds,  "Of  all  the  thirty-six  ways  to  get  out  of trouble,  the  best  way  is-leave."  In  the  Information  Age,  that  Oriental wisdom will be easily applied. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  operations  become  uncomfortable  due  to  excessive  demands  in  one location,  it  will  be  far  easier  to  move.  Indeed,  as  we  explore  below,  it will  be  possible  in  the  Information  Age  to  create  virtual  corporations whose domicile in any jurisdiction will be entirely contingent on the spot market.  An  overnight  increase  in  the  degree  of  attempted  extortion, either by governments or others, could lead to the activities and assets of the virtual corporation fleeing the jurisdiction at the speed of light. </p>

<p class="calibre1">185</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-187"></a>The  growing  integration  of  microtechnology  into  industrial  processes means that even those firms that still deal in manufactured products with great economies of scale are no longer as vulnerable to the leverage of violence  as  they  once  Were.  An  example  illustrating  this  point  is  the collapse  of  the  limited  Auto  Workers  union's  lengthy  strike  against Caterpillar, which was called off in the waning days of 1995 after almost two  years.  Unlike  the  assembly  lines  of  the  1930s,  today's  Caterpillar plant employs far more skilled workers. Pressed by foreign competition, Caterpillar  farmed  out  much  of  its  low-skill  work,  closed  inefficient plants,  and  spent  almost  $2  billion  computerizing  machine  tools  and installing assembly robots. Even the strike itself helped spur labor-saving efficiencies.  The  company  now  claims  to  need  two  thousand  fewer employees  than  when  the  walkout  began."  The  megapolitics  of  the production process has altered more drastically than most people realize. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This change is not yet clearly visible, partly because there is always a lag between  a  revolution  in  megapolitical  conditions  and  the  institutional changes  it  inevitably  precipitates.  Further,  the  rapid  evolution  of microprocessing technology means that products are now on the horizon whose  megapolitical  consequences  can  be  anticipated  even  before  they exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They will make for a far different world. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">EXPLOITATION OF THE CAPITALISTS BY THE WORKERS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The character of technology through most of the twentieth century made the  forcible  seizure  of  a  factory,  or  a  sit-down  strike,  a  hard  tactic  for owners or managers to 116</p>

<p class="calibre1">counter. As historian Robert S. McElvaine put it, a sit-down strike "made it  difficult  for  employers  to  break  the  strike  without  doing  the  same  to their  own  equipment."  12  In  effect,  the  workers  physically  held  the owners'  capital  to  ransom.  For  reasons  we  explore  below,  larger industrial  companies  proved  easier  targets  for  unions  to  exploit  than smaller  firms.  In  1937,  General  Motors  was  perhaps  the  leading industrial corporation in the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Its  factories  were  among  the  largest  and  most  costly  aggregations  of machinery  ever  assembled,  employing  many  thousands  of  workers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">186</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-188"></a>Every hour, every day that the GM plants were forced to sit idle cost the company a small fortune. A strike that remained unsettled for weeks, like that in the winter of 1936-37, meant rapidly ballooning losses. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unable  to  produce  automobiles  after  the  seizure  of  its  third  plant,  GM</p>

<p class="calibre1">soon  capitulated  to  the  union.  This  was  hardly  an  economic  decision based upon the supply and demand for labor. Far from it. When General Motors  acceded  to  the  union  demands  there  were  nine  million  persons unemployed in the United States, 14 percent of the workforce. Most of those without work would gladly have taken jobs at GM. They certainly had  the  skills  to  fill  assembly-line  jobs,  although  you  might  not  know this  from  most  contemporary  accounts.  A  delicate  etiquette  shrouded straightforward  analysis  of  labor  relations  during  the  industrial  period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One  of  its  pretenses  was  the  idea  that  factory  jobs,  particularly  in  the middle  of  the  twentieth  century,  were  skilled  work.  This  was  untrue. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most factory jobs could have been performed by almost anyone capable of showing up on time. They required little or no training, not even the ability to read or write. As recently as the 1980s, large fractions of the General  Motors  workforce  were  either  illiterate,  innumerate,  or  both. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Until the 1990s, the typical assembly-line worker at GM received only one day of orientation before taking his place on the assembly line. A job you can learn in a single day is not skilled work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  in  1937,  with  unskilled  and  skilled  workers  alike  lined  up  begging for jobs, GM factory workers were able to coerce their employers into a pay  hike.  Their  success  had  much  more  to  do  with  the  dynamics  of violence than with the supply and demand for labor. In March 1937, the month following the settlement of the GM confrontation, there were 17</p>

<p class="calibre1">more sit-down strikes in the United States. Most were successful. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Similar  episodes  occurred  in  every  industrialized  country.  The  workers simply  seized  the  factories  and  ransomed  them  back  to  the  owners.  It was a tactic of great simplicity, and one that in most cases was profitable and fun for those participating. One sit-down striker wrote, "I am having a  great  time,  something  new,  something  different,  lots  of  grub  and music." The GM sit-down strike of 1936-37 and the other forcible plant seizures  of  the  time  were  examples  of  a  phenomenon  we  described  in 187</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-189"></a> <i class="calibre3">Blood  in  the  Streets</i>  as  "the  exploitation  of  the  capitalists  by  the workers." This was not the view that Pete Seeger set to music in his sad songs.  But  unless  you  are  planning  a  career  as  a  folk  singer  in  a  blue-collar  neighborhood  the  important  thing  to  focus  on  is  not  the  popular 117</p>

<p class="calibre1">interpretation  but  the  underlying  reality.  Wherever  you  look  in  history there  is  generally  a  layer  of  rationalization  and  make-believe  that disguises the true megapolitical foundations of any systematic extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  take  the  rationalizations  at  face  value,  you  are  unlikely  to  grasp what is really going on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">188</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-190"></a><b class="calibre4">DECIPHERING THE LOGIC OF EXTORTION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  recognize  the  megapolitical  implications  of  the  current  shift  to  the Information Age, you have to strip away the cant and focus on the real logic of violence in society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is like stripping away the layers of an overripe onion. It may bring tears  to  your  eyes,  but  don't  look  away.  We  first  examine  the  logic  of extortion  in  the  workplace,  then  extend  the  analysis  to  broader  issues involving the creation and protection of assets, and the nature of modern government.  To  a  greater  degree  than  most  people  imagine,  the prosperity of government, like that of unions, was directly correlated to the leverage available for extortion. That leverage was much lower in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth. In the next millennium, it will fall almost to the vanishing point. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  whole  logic  of  government  and  the  character  of  power  have  been transformed by microprocessing. This may seem exaggerated when you first think about it. But look closely. The prosperity of governments has gone  hand  in  hand  with  the  prosperity  of  labor  unions  in  the  twentieth century. Before this century, most governments commandeered far fewer resources  than  the  militant  welfare  states  to  which  we  have  become accustomed.  Likewise,  unions  were  small  or  insignificant  factors  in economic life prior to this century. The ability of workers to coerce their employers  into  paying  above-market  wages  depended  upon  the  same megapolitical conditions that allowed governments to extract 40 percent or more of the economy's output in taxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Workplace Extortion Before the Twentieth Century</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  rise  and  fall  of  union  extortion  of  the  capitalists  can  be  readily explained  by  the  changing  megapolitics  of  the  production  process.  In 1776,  when  Adam  Smith  published  The  Wealth  of  Nations,  conditions for  extortion  in  the  workplace  were  sufficiently  unfavorable  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"combinations"  by  workmen  "to  raise  the  price  of  their  labour"  were seldom tenable. Most manufacturing firms were tiny and family-run. </p>

<p class="calibre1">189</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-191"></a>Larger-scale industrial activities were just beginning to emerge. This did not  rule  out  opportunities  for  violence,  but  it  gave  them  little  leverage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, during Smith's time and well into the nineteenth century, unions were generally considered illegal combinations in the Great Britain, the United States, and other common-law countries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Adam  Smith  described  attempted  strikes  in  these  terms:  "Their  usual pretences  are  sometimes  the  high  price  of  provisions;  sometimes  the great  profit  which  their  master  make  by  their  work.  .  .  .  [T]hey  have always  recourse  to  the  loudest  clamour,  and  sometimes  to  the  most shocking  violence  and  outrage."  '4  Nonetheless,  the  workmen  "very seldom derive any advantage of those tumultuous combinations," except</p>

<p class="calibre1">"the punishment or ruin of the ringleaders." ' </p>

<p class="calibre1">118</p>

<p class="calibre1">Scale  economies  in  industry  and  firm  size  grew  during  the  nineteenth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  most  individuals  continued  to  work  for  themselves  as  farmers  or small  proprietors,  and  union  organizing  efforts,  like  those  described  by Adam Smith, continued to "generally end in nothing." 17</p>

<p class="calibre1">The legal and political standing of unions changed only as the scale of enterprise rose. The first unions that succeeded in organizing were craft unions  of  highly  skilled  workers,  who  normally  organized  without extensive violence. They tended to settle for wage increases that matched the marginal costs of replacing them. Unions for unskilled workers were another story. They tended to exploit the shift to firms of larger scale by singling  out  for  organizing  efforts  precisely  those  industries  that  were especially vulnerable to coercion, either because they operated at a larger scale or the character of the operations exposed their owners to physical sabotage. This pattern was borne out from Newcastle to Argentina.' </p>

<p class="calibre1">An early example of violent labor movements in the United States was an attack on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in 1834. Unlike most early-nineteenth-century businesses, the C&amp;O Canal was not a contained and easily protected operation. As originally planned, it was to have stretched 342  miles,  with  a  3,000-foot  rise  from  the  lower  Potomac  to  the  upper 190</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-192"></a>Ohio.18  Digging  such  a  ditch  was  a  big  job  that  never  quite  got completed.  Nonetheless,  a  large  number  of  workers  were  employed trying to do it, some of whom were not long in recognizing that the canal could be easily incapacitated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, without regular maintenance, it could be sabotaged by muskrats burrowing  under  the  towpath.  In  operation,  the  canal's  locks  and channels  could  be  ruined  simply  by  careless  use,  floods  from  heavy rains, or battering by untowed boats. It was a simple matter for strikers to blockade the waterway with sunken boats or other debris. In early 1834, rioting among rival gangs of Irish workers on the C&amp;O led to an attempt to  make  good  this  potential  and  seize  the  canal.  The  effort  failed, however, leaving five persons dead, after President Andrew Jackson sent federal troops from Ft. McHenry to disperse the workers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mines  and  railroads  also  offered  early  targets  of  choice  for  union activism  in  America.  Like  the  C&amp;O  Canal,  they,  too,  were  highly vulnerable  to  sabotage.  Mines,  for  example,  could  be  flooded,  or blockaded  at  the  entrance.  Simply  killing  the  mules  that  towed  the  ore cars  out  of  underground  mines  created  a  difficult  and  unpleasant situation  for  the  owners.  Likewise,  railroad  trackbeds  stretched  over many miles, and could be guarded only with difficulty. It was relatively easy  for  union  thugs  to  attack  mines  and  railroads  and  do  substantial economic  damage.  Such  attacks  became  commonplace  during  attempts to  organize  effective  unions.  These  efforts  were  generally  most  intense during  periods  when  real  wages  were  rising  due  to  deflation.  When owners attempted to adjust nominal wages, this often triggered protests leading  to  violence.  Such  incidents  were  widespread  in  the  depression that followed the Panic of 1873. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In December 1874, open warfare erupted in the anthracite coalfields of eastern Pennsylvania. The unions organized a violent strike force in the guise  of  a  secret  society  named  the  Ancient  Order  of  Hibernians.  Also known as the "Molly Maguires," after an Irish revolutionary, this group was  known  for  terrorizing  the  coal  fields  and  preventing  those  miners who  wished  to  work  from  doing  so.  Sabotage  and  destruction  of property, 119</p>

<p class="calibre1">191</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-193"></a>outright  murder  and  assassination,  were  all  charged  against  its members." There was also recurring violence among railroad employees. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  example,  there  were  serious  outbreaks  in  July  1877  aimed  at destroying the property of both the Pennsylvania and Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroads. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Workers took over switches, tore up tracks, sealed off car yards, disabled locomotives,  sabotaged,  then  looted  trains,  and  worse.  In  Pittsburgh, roundhouses of the Pennsylvania Railroad were set ablaze with hundreds of people inside. Dozens were killed, two thousand railcars were burned and  looted  and  the  machine  shop  was  destroyed,  along  with  a  grain elevator and 125 locomotives. Federal troops intervened to restore order. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Although these early strikes were interpreted sympathetically by socialist and union activists, they inspired little public support. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  inherent  vulnerability  of  industries  such  as  mines and railroads, overall megapolitical conditions were not yet favorable to the exploitation of the capitalists by the workers. The scale of enterprise was  too  small  to  facilitate  systematic  extortion.  While  there  were vulnerable  industries,  they  employed  too  small  a  fraction  of  the population to allow the benefits of the coercion against employers to be broadly shared. Without such support, they were unsustainable because owners could depend upon the government for protection. While unions sometimes attempted through intimidation to prevent local officials from enforcing  injunctions,  these  efforts,  too,  were  seldom  successful.  Even the most violent strikes were usually suppressed within days or weeks by military means. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Blackmail Made Easy</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">There is a lesson to be learned for the Information Age in the fact that union  attempts  to  achieve  wages  above  market-clearing  levels  were seldom  successful  when  firm  size  was  small.  Not  even  those  lines  of business  that  were  clearly  vulnerable  to  sabotage,  such  as  canals, railways, streetcars, and mines, were easily brought under control. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  not  because  the  unions  shrank  from  using  violence.  To  the contrary. </p>

<p class="calibre1">192</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-194"></a>Violence  was  lavishly  employed,  sometimes  against  high-profile individuals.  For  example,  in  a  case  celebrated  in  the  American  labor movement as a case of "'miners' </p>

<p class="calibre1">vengeance," Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho, who had opposed an attempt  by  miners  to  blockade  properties  at  Coeur  d'Alene,  was assassinated by a bomb tossed by a contract killer hired by the union. 21</p>

<p class="calibre1">But  even  murder  and  threats  of  murder  were  usually  insufficient  to obtain union recognition prior to the emergence of large-scale factories and mass-production enterprises in the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To understand why the circumstances of unions underwent such a change in  the  twentieth  century,  you  must  look  at  the  characteristics  of production technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Something  definitely  changed  with  the  rapid  rise  of  blue-collar  factory employment  in  the  early  decades  of  the  twentieth  century.  This  change made businesses at the forefront of the economy especially vulnerable to extortion.  In  fact,  the  physical  characteristics  of  industrial  technology almost invited workers to employ coercion to shake down the capitalists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">120</p>

<p class="calibre1">Consider:</p>

<p class="calibre1">1. There was a high natural-resource content in most industrial products. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  tended  to  anchor  production  to  a  limited  number  of  locations, almost in the way that mines must be located where the ore bodies are. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Factories  placed  near  transportation  centers  with  convenient  access  to parts  suppliers  and  raw  materials  had  significant  operating  advantages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  made  it  easier  for  coercive  organizations,  like  governments  and unions, to extract some of those advantages for themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2.  Rising  economies  of  scale  led  to  very  large  enterprises.  Early-nineteenth-century  factories  had  been  relatively  small.  But  as  scale economies increased with the assembly line during the twentieth century, the  size  and  cost  of  facilities  at  the  forefront  of  the  production  process rose rapidly. This made them easier targets in several ways. </p>

<p class="calibre1">193</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-195"></a>For example, significant scale economies tend to go hand in hand with long product cycles. Long product cycles make for more stable markets. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This, in turn, invites predatory targeting of firms because it implies that there are longer-term benefits to capture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. The number of competitors in leading industries fell sharply It was not uncommon  during  the  industrial  period  to  find  only  a  handful  of  firms competing  for  billion-dollar  markets.  This  contributed  to  making  these firms targets for union extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  far  simpler  to  attack  five  firms  than  five  thousand.  The  very concentration  of  industry  was  itself  a  factor  that  facilitated  extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  advantage  was  self-reinforcing  because  the  firms  coerced  into paying  monopoly  wages  were  unlikely  to  face  stiff  competition  from others who were not also burdened by above-market labor costs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unions could therefore drain a considerable portion of the profits of such firms  without  exposing  them  to  immediate  bankruptcy.  Obviously,  if employers had routinely gone broke whenever they were forced to pay above-market wages, workers would have gained little by coercing them to do so. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. The capital requirements for freed investment rose to match the scale of  enterprise.  This  not  only  increased  the  vulnerability  of  capital  and magnified  the  costs  of  plant  closures;  it  also  made  it  increasingly unlikely that a modern factory could be owned by a single individual or family, except through inheritance from someone who had launched the business at a smaller scale. In order to fund the massive costs of tooling and  operating  a  large  factory,  the  wealth  of  hundreds  or  thousands  of people had to be pooled together in capital markets. This tended to make it  more  difficult  for  the  splintered  and  almost  anonymous  owners  to defend their property. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  had  little  choice  but  to  rely  upon  professional  managers  who seldom held more than a bare chemical trace of the outstanding shares of the company. Reliance on subordinate managers weakened the resistance of firms to extortion. The managers lacked strong incentives to risk life and limb protecting the property of the firm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">194</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-196"></a>Their  efforts  seldom  matched  the  kind  of  militancy  commonly  seen among  owners  of  liquor  stores  and  other  small  businesses  when  their property comes under threat. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5.  Greater  firm  size  also  meant  that  more  of  the  total  workforce  was employed in fewer firms than at any time in the past. In some cases, tens of  thousands  of  workers  found  employment  in  a  single  company.  In military terms, the owners and managers 121</p>

<p class="calibre1">were starkly outnumbered by persons employed in subordinate positions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ratios  of  thirty  to  one  or  worse  were  common.  This  disadvantage  rose with firm size because massive numbers of workers assembled together could  more  easily  employ  violence  in  an  anonymous  way.  Under  such conditions,  the  workers  were  unlikely  to  have  had  any  meaningful contact or relationships with the owners of the factory. The anonymous character  of  these  relationships  no  doubt  made  it  easier  for  workers  to dismiss the importance of the owners' property rights. </p>

<p class="calibre1">6.  Massed  employment  in  a  small  number  of  firms  was  a  broad  social phenomenon.  This  further  enhanced  the  megapolitical  advantages enjoyed  by  unions  as  compared  to  the  nineteenth  century  in  America, when  most  people  were  self-employed  or  working  in  small  firms.  In 1940, 6 percent of the American workforce had blue-collar jobs.22 As a consequence,  support  for  the  use  of  extortion  to  raise  wages  spread among a large number who imagined they might benefit by it. This was illustrated by a 1938-39</p>

<p class="calibre1">study  of  the  views  of  1,700  people  in  Akron,  Ohio,  toward  corporate property. The survey found that 68 percent of the CIO Rubber Workers had  very  little  or  no  sympathy  with  the  concept  of  corporate  property, </p>

<p class="calibre1">'while only one percent were found in the classification of strong support of  corporate  property  rights."  23  On  the  other  hand,  not  a  single businessman,  even  a  small  proprietor,  fell  into  the  same  category  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"strong opposition to corporate property; 94 percent received ratings in the range of extremely high support for the rights of property."2</p>

<p class="calibre1">7. Assembly-line technology was inherently sequential. The fact that the whole production process depended upon the movement and assembly of parts in a fixed sequence created additional vulnerabilities to disruption. </p>

<p class="calibre1">195</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-197"></a>In effect, the assembly line was like a railroad within factory walls. If the track could be blocked, or the availability of a single part could be cut off, the whole production process was brought to a halt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">8.  Assembly-line  technology  standardized  work.  This  reduced  the variability of output for persons of different skills working with the same tools. In fact, a crucial objective of factory design was to create a system in which a genius and a moron on successive shifts of the assembly line would  produce  the  same  product.  What  might  be  called  "stupid" </p>

<p class="calibre1">machines were designed to be capable of only one kind of output. This made it unnecessary for even the buyer of a Cadillac to inquire about the identity of the line workers who produced his vehicle. All the products were meant to be alike, whatever the differences in skills and intelligence between the workers who produced them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that unskilled workers on the assembly line could produce the same  product  as  more  able  individuals  contributed  to  the  egalitarian agenda by making it appear that everyone's economic contributions were equal. Entrepreneurial skills and mental effort seemed less important. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  magic  of  modern  production  appeared  to  lie  in  the  machines themselves. If they could not actually have been designed by everyone, they  nevertheless  appeared  to  be  intellectually  accessible  to  almost everyone. This gave more plausibility to the fiction that unskilled labor was  being  "exploited"  by  factory  owners  who  could  be  cut  out  of  the equation with no loss to anyone but themselves. "We learned we can take the plant," as 122</p>

<p class="calibre1">one  GM  striker  put  it.  "We  already  knew  how  to  run  them.  If  General Motors isn't careful we'll put two and two together." 2</p>

<p class="calibre1">These  characteristics  of  industrial  technology  led  uniformly  to  the creation of labor unions to exploit the vulnerability to shakedowns, and to  larger  governments  that  fattened  on  the  high  taxes  that  could  be imposed upon large-scale industrial facilities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  did  not  happen  once  or  twice,  it  happened  everywhere  large-scale industry took root. </p>

<p class="calibre1">196</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-198"></a>Time  after  time,  unions  emerged  to  employ  violence  to  achieve  wages considerably  above  market  levels.  They  were  able  to  do  this  because industrial factories tended to be expensive, conspicuous, immobile, and costly. They could scarcely be hidden. They could not be moved. Every moment they were out of service meant that their staggering costs were not being amortized. </p>

<p class="calibre1">All this made them sitting ducks for coercive shakedowns, a fact that is far  more  obvious  in  the  history  of  labor  unions  than  the  prevailing ideology  of  the  twentieth  century  would  have  you  believe.  The  noted economist  Henry  Simons  framed  the  issue  in  1944:  Labor  organization without  large  powers  of  coercion  and  intimidation  is  an  unreal abstraction.  Unions  now  have  such  powers;  they  always  have  had  and always will have, so long as they persist in the present form. Where the power is small or insecurely possessed, it must be exercised overtly and extensively;  large  and  unchallenged,  it  becomes  like  the  power  of government, confidently held, respectfully regarded, and rarely displayed conspicuously." 2</p>

<p class="calibre1">As  precise  as  Simons's  analysis  is,  however,  he  was  wrong  about  a crucial point. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He presumed that unions "always will have" what he described as "large powers  of  coercion  and  intimidation."  In  fact,  unions  are  fading  away, not  merely  in  the  United  States  and  Great  Britain,  but  in  other  mature industrial societies. The reason they are fading, what Simons missed and what even many union organizers fail to understand, is that the shift to an Information Society has altered megapolitical conditions in crucial ways that  sharply  increase  the  security  of  property.  Microtechnology  has already  begun  to  prove  subversive  of  the  extortion  that  supports  the welfare  state  because  even  in  the  commercial  realm  it  creates  very different incentives from those of the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">1.  Information  technology  has  negligible  natural-resource  content.  It confers  few  if  any  inherent  advantages  of  location.  Most  information technology  is  highly  portable.  Because  it  can  function  independent  of place,  information  technology  increases  the  mobility  of  ideas,  persons, and capital. General Motors could not pack up its three assembly lines in Flint, Michigan, and fly away. A software company can. The owners can 197</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-199"></a>download  their  algorithms  into  portable  computers  and  take  the  next plane  out.  Such  firms  also  have  an  added  inducement  to  escape  high taxes or union demands for monopoly wages. Smaller firms tend to have more competitors. If you have dozens or even hundreds of competitors tempting  your  customers,  you  cannot  afford  to  pay  politicians  or  your employees much more than they are actually worth. If you alone tried to do so, your costs would be higher than your competitors and you would go  broke.  The  absence  of  significant  operating  advantages  in  a  given locale  means  that  coercive  organizations,  like  governments  and  unions, will inevitably have less leverage to exploit in trying to extract some of those advantages for themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">123</p>

<p class="calibre1">2. Information technology lowers the scale of enterprise. This makes for smaller  firm  size,  which  implies  a  larger  number  of  competitors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Increased  competition  reduces  the  potential  for  extortion  by  raising  the number  of  targets  that  must  be  physically  controlled  in  order  to  raise wages or tax rates above competitive levels. The sharp fall in the average size  of  firms  facilitated  by  information  technology  has  already  reduced the number of persons employed in subordinate positions. In the United States, for example, widely reported estimates suggest that as many as 30</p>

<p class="calibre1">million  persons  worked  alone  in  their  own  firms  in  1996.  Obviously, these 30 million are unlikely to go on strike against themselves. It is only slightly  less  plausible  that  the  additional  millions  who  work  in  small firms  with  a  handful  of  employees  would  attempt  to  coerce  their employers into paying above-market wages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the Information Age, workers who wish to raise their wages through extortion will lack the military advantage of overwhelming numbers that made  them  more  formidable  within  the  factory.  The  fewer  persons employed  in  any  firm,  the  fewer  the  opportunities  for  anonymous violence. For this reason alone, ten thousand workers divided among five hundred firms would pose a lesser threat to the property of those firms than ten thousand workers in a single firm, even if thc ratio of workers to owners/managers was exactly the same. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3.  Falling  scale  in  enterprise  also  implies  that  efforts  to  secure  above-market wages are less likely to command broad social support, as they 198</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-200"></a>did in the industrial period. Unions seeking to shake down employers are much  more  likely  to  find  themselves  in  the  situation  of  the  canal workers, railroad employees, and miners of the nineteenth century. Even where a few firms with large-scale economies remain as holdovers from the  Industrial  Age,  they  will  do  so  in  a  context  of  widely  dispersed employment  in  small  firms.  The  preponderance  of  small  firms  and smallholders  suggests  greater  social  support  for  property  rights  even  if the desire to redistribute income remains unaltered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4.  Information  technology  lowers  capital  costs,  which  also  tends  to increase competition by facilitating entrepreneurship and allowing more people  to  work  independently.  Lower  capital  requirements  not  only reduce  barriers  to  entry;  they  also  reduce  "barriers  to  exit."  In  other words,  they  imply  that  firms  are  likely  to  have  fewer  assets  relative  to income,  and  therefore  less  ability  to  sustain  losses.  Not  only  will  they tend  to  have  less  recourse  to  banks  for  borrowing;  firms  in  the Information Age are also likely to have fewer physical assets to capture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5.  Information  technology  shortens  the  product  cycle.  This  makes  for more rapid product obsolescence. This, too, tends to make any gains that might  be  achieved  by  extorting  above-market  wages  short-lived.  In highly competitive markets, wages that are too high may lead directly to a rapid loss of jobs and even bankruptcy for the firm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Grasping for temporarily higher wages at the expense of placing your job in  jeopardy  is  like  burning  your  furniture  to  make  the  house  a  few degrees warmer. </p>

<p class="calibre1">6.  Information  technology  is  not  sequential  but  simultaneous  and dispersed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike  the  assembly  line,  information  technology  can  accommodate multiple processes at the same time. It disperses activities on networks, allowing  for  redundancy  and  substitution  between  workstations  that could number in the thousands or even the 124</p>

<p class="calibre1">millions and be anywhere on earth. In increasing numbers of activities, it is  possible  for  people  to  cooperate  without  ever  coming  into  physical contact  with  one  another.  As  virtual  reality  and  video  conferencing 199</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-201"></a>become  more  advanced,  the  trend  toward  dispersal  of  functions  and telecommuting will accelerate. This is the Information Age equivalent of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"putting out," which broke the power of the medieval guilds. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that fewer and fewer people will be working together in smoky factories  not  only  takes  away  an  important  advantage  that  workers formerly enjoyed in engineering shakedowns of capitalists; it also makes it increasingly difficult even to distinguish from racketeering the type of extortion that has been acceptable in the workplace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Heretofore, only persons who have worked together and been employed by a firm in a common setting have been permitted to use violence in the attempt to raise their incomes. But if the "workplace" does not exist as a central  location,  and  most  of  the  functions  are  dispersed  to subcontractors and telecommuters, there is very little to distinguish from a  shakedown  racket  their  efforts  to  extort  money  from  their  clients  or</p>

<p class="calibre1">"employers."  For  example,  is  a  telecommuter  who  demands  extra  cash under threat of infecting the company's computers with a virus a worker on strike? Or an Internet racketeer? Whether he is one or the other will prove  to  be  a  distinction  without  a  difference.  The  reaction  of  the targeted firms is likely to be much the same in any event. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technical  solutions  to  information  sabotage,  like  improved  encryption and network security, that would answer the danger of an outside hacker should  also  render  moot  the  capacity  of  the  disgruntled  employee  or subcontractor  to  impose  damage  on  parties  with  whom  he  regularly  or sporadically deals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, it might be suggested that the worker or telecommuter could always report to the office and carry on a more traditional strike there. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But even this may not be as simple as it would seem in the Information Age.  The  capacity  of  information  technology  to  transcend  locality  and disperse economic functions means that for the first time employees and employers need not even reside in the same jurisdictions. Here, we are not  talking  about  the  difference  between  being  in  the  boroughs  of Mayfair and Peckham, but of employers in Bermuda and telecommuters in New Delhi. </p>

<p class="calibre1">200</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-202"></a>Furthermore,  if  the  Indians  became  infatuated  by  accounts  of  the  great GM strikes of 1936-37 and determined to journey to Bermuda to picket, they might find no physical office at all when they arrived. Chiat/Day, a large  advertising  company,  has  already  set  about  dismantling  its headquarters.  Its  employees,  or  subcontractors,  stay  in  touch  through call-forwarding and the Internet. When it becomes necessary to assemble talent  teams  to  coordinate  work  on  account  projects,  they  rent  hotel meeting rooms. When the project is over they check out. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  microprocessing  helps  to  liberate  and  disperse  the production process from the fixed sequence of the assembly line greatly reduces  the  leverage  formerly  enjoyed  by  coercive  institutions  like unions and governments. If the assembly line were like a railroad within factory  walls  that  could  easily  be  captured  by  a  sit-down  strike, cyberspace is an unbounded realm without physical existence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  cannot  be  occupied  by  force  or  held  to  ransom.  The  position  of employees wishing to use violence as leverage to extract higher income will  be  far  weaker  in  the  Information  Age  than  it  was  for  the  sit-down strikers at General Motors in 1936-37. </p>

<p class="calibre1">125</p>

<p class="calibre1">7.  Microprocessing  individualizes  work  Industrial  technology standardized  work.  Anyone  using  the  same  tools  would  produce  the same  output.  Microtechnology  has  started  replacing  "stupid"  machines with more intelligent technology capable of highly variable output. The increased  variability  of  output  for  persons  using  the  same  tools  has profound implications, many of which we explore in coming chapters. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Among the more important is the fact that where output varies, incomes vary as well. Most of the value in fields where skill varies will tend to be created by a small number of persons. This is a common characteristic of the most highly competitive markets. It is quite evident, for example, in sports. Many millions of young people worldwide play various versions of football. But 99 percent of the money that is spent to watch football games  is  paid  to  see  the  performances  of  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  total number of players. </p>

<p class="calibre1">201</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-203"></a>Likewise,  the  world  is  full  of  aspiring  actors  and  actresses.  Yet  only  a relatively  small  number  become  stars.  Equally,  tens  of  thousands  of books are published annually. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But most of the royalty money is paid to a small number of best-selling authors  who  can  really  entertain  their  readers.  Unhappily,  we  are  not among them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  vast  variability  of  output  among  persons  employing  the  same equipment  poses  yet  another  obstacle  to  extortion.  It  creates  a  major bargaining  problem  about  how  to  share  the  payoff.  Where  a  relatively small proportion of those participating in a given activity create most of the value, it is all but mathematically impossible for them to be left better off  by  a  coerced  outcome  that  averages  incomes.  One  software programmer may devise an algorithm for controlling a robot that proves to be worth millions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another, working with identical equipment, may write a program worth nothing. The more productive programmer is no more likely to wish to have  his  income  tied  to  that  of  his  compatriot  than  Tom  Clancy  is  to agree to average his book royalties with ours. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  the  early  stages  of  the  Information  Revolution  have  made  it  far more obvious than it was in 1975 that skills and mental ability are crucial variables in economic output. This has already vaporized the once-proud rationalization  for  extortion  of  the  capitalists  by  the  workers  that prevailed  during  the  industrial  period.  The  fantasy  that  unskilled  labor actually  created  the  value  that  seemed  to  be  pocketed  in  a disproportionate share by the capitalists and entrepreneurs is already an anachronism. It is not even a plausible fiction in the case of information technology. When the programmer sits down to write code, there is too direct a line of attribution between his skill and his product to allow for much mistake about who is responsible. It is obvious beyond dispute that an illiterate or semi-literate could not program a computer. It is therefore equally obvious that any value in programs compiled by others could not have  been  stolen  from  him.  This  is  why  cries  of  "exploitation"  by workers are now heard mainly among janitors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">202</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-204"></a>Information  technology  is  making  it  plain  that  the  problem  faced  by persons  of  low  skill  is  not  that  their  productive  capacities  are  being unfairly  taken  advantage  of;  but  rather  the  fear  that  they  may  lack  the ability to make a real economic contribution. As Kevin Kelly suggests in <i class="calibre3">Out Of Control</i>, the "Upstart" car company of the Information Age may be the brainchild of "a dozen people," who will outsource most of their parts,  and  still  produce  cars  more  carefully  customized  and  tailored  to their buyer's wishes than 126</p>

<p class="calibre1">anything  yet  seen  from  Detroit  or  Tokyo:  "Cars,  each  one  customer-tailored, are ordered by a network of customers and shipped the minute they are done.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Tools with a Voice" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  an  increasing  extent,  unskilled  work  can  be  done  by  automated machines,  robots,  and  computational  systems,  like  digital  assistants. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When Aristotle described slaves as "tools with a voice," he was talking about human beings. In the not-distant future, "tools with a voice," like the  genies  of  fable,  will  be  able  to  speak  and  follow  instructions,  and even  handle  complex  assignments.  Rapidly  increasing  computational power  has  already  brought  forth  a  number  of  primitive  applications  of voice  recognition,  such  as  hands-free  telephones  and  computers  that perform  mathematical  computations  following  verbal  instructions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Computers  that  convert  speech  to  text  were  already  being  marketed  in late  1996  as  we  write.  As  pattern-recognition  capabilities  improve, computers linked to voice synthesizers will operate through networks to perform numerous functions formerly undertaken by humans employed as  telephone  operators,  secretaries,  travel  agents,  administrative assistants, chess champions, claims processors, composers, bond traders, cyberwar  specialists,  weapons  analysts,  or  even  street-smart  flirts  who answer the telephones on 900 calls. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Michael  Mauldin  of  Carnegie-Mellon  University  has  programmed  a  an artificial  personality  named  Julia,  who  is  capable  of  fooling  almost 203</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-205"></a>anyone  with  whom  she  converses  on  the  Internet.  According  to  press reports,  Julia  is  a  wise-cracking  dame  who  lives  out  her  life  in  a  role-playing game on the Internet. She is smart, funny and loves to flirt. She is  also  a  bit  of  a  hockey  whiz  and  able  to  come  up  with  the  perfect sarcastic comment on a moment's notice. Julia, however, is no lady. She is  a  bot,  an  artificial  intelligence  that  exists  only  in  the  ether  of  the Internet."28  The  startling  progress  that  has  already  been  made  in programming artificial intelligence and digital servants leaves little doubt that  many  practical  applications  are  still  to  come.  This  has  significant megapolitical consequences. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Individual as an Ensemble</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Development of "tools with a voice" for multiple applications creates the possibility  for  dispersal  of  the  individual  into  multiple  simultaneous activities.  The  individual  will  no  longer  be  singular,  but  potentially  an ensemble  of  dozens  or  perhaps  even  thousands  of  activities  undertaken through  intelligent  agents.  This  will  not  only  greatly  enhance  the productive capability of the most talented individuals; it will also make the Sovereign Individual potentially far more formidable militarily than the individual has ever been before. </p>

<p class="calibre1">127</p>

<p class="calibre1">Not only will one individual be able to manifestly multiply his activities by employing an essentially unlimited number of intelligent agents. He or  she  will  even  be  able  to  act  after  death.  For  the  first  time,  an individual  will  be  capable  of  carrying  on  elaborate  tasks  even  if  he  is biologically dead. It will no longer be possible for either an enemy at war or a criminal to completely extinguish the capability of an individual to retaliate  by  killing  him.  This  is  one  of  the  more  revolutionary innovations in the logic of violence in the whole of history. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Insights for the Information Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The biggest changes in life occur to variables that no one watches. Or to put  it  another  way,  we  take  for  granted  variables  that  have  fluctuated very little for centuries or even hundreds of generations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">204</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-206"></a>For  most  of  history,  if  not  for  most  of  human  existence,  the  balance between protection and extortion has fluctuated within a narrow margin, with  extortion  always  holding  the  upper  hand.  Now  that  is  about  to change.  information  technology  is  laying  the  groundwork  for  a fundamental shift in the factors that determine the costs and rewards of resorting to violence. The fact that intelligent agents will be available to investigate and perhaps retaliate in one fashion or another against those who  initiate  violence  is  merely  a  hint  of  this  new  vista  in  protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Twenty-five  years  ago,  the  following  statement  would  have  been  no more than the ranting of a crank: "If you kill me, I will sweep the money out  of  your  bank  accounts  and  give  it  to  charities  in  Nepal."  After  the turn  of  the  millennium,  it  may  not  be.  Whether  it  would  prove  to  be  a practical  threat  would  be  determined  by  factors  of  time  and  place.  Yet even  if  the  would-be  miscreant's  accounts  proved  to  be  impermeable, there  would  surely  be  other  costly  mischief  that  an  army  of  intelligent agents could impose in retaliation for a crime. Think about it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">New Alternatives in Protection</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  only  one  of  many  ways  to  enhance  protection  that  are  being opened by the technology of the Information Age, most of which tend to undermine the near-monopoly on protection and extortion that has been enjoyed by governments in the past two centuries. Even without the new technological  razzle-dazzle,  there  have  always  been  alternatives  for protection,  not  all  of  which  have  tended  to  be  monopolized  by government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  person  who  feels  threatened  may  simply  run  away.  When  the  world was  young  and  horizons  were  open,  the  option  to  flee  was  commonly employed.  When  people  worry  about  losses  due  to  theft  or  vandalism, they may elect to purchase insurance policies to indemnify such risks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Curses  and  spells,  although  weak  forms  of  protection,  have  also  saved lives  and  warded  off  acts  of  theft.  They  sometimes  work  in  societies where  predators  are  superstitious.  Valuables  may  also  be  protected  by being  hidden.  This  is  sometimes  an  effective  method  when  it  can  be employed. Assets can be buried. Secured with locks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">128</p>

<p class="calibre1">205</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-207"></a>Placed  behind  high  walls.  And  rigged  with  sirens  and  electronic monitoring  devices.  But  hiding  person  and  property  have  not  always been practical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  all  the  variety  of  means  of  protection  that  have  been  employed historically, one method has dominated all others-the capacity to trump violence  with  violence,  to  call  on  greater  force  to  overwhelm  anyone who would assault you or steal your property. The question is where you can turn for such a service, and how you can motivate anyone to risk life and limb to help you battle thugs who might initiate force against you. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sometimes close relatives have answered the call. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  tribal  and  clan-based  groups  have  served  as  an  unofficial police, responding to violence against any of their members with blood vendettas. Sometimes mercenaries or private guards have been employed to fend off attack, but not always as usefully as you might wish. The new intelligent agents of the Information Age, although their activities will be largely  confined  to  cyberspace,  add  a  new  alternative.  Their  loyalties, unlike those of the mercenaries, private guards, and even remote cousins, will be beyond dispute. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Paradoxes of Power</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The use of violence to protect against violence is fraught with paradoxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under conditions that have heretofore existed, any group or agency that you  could  employ  to  successfully  protect  your  life  and  wealth  from attack would also necessarily have had the capacity to take either. That is a drawback for which there is no easy answer. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Normally,  you  could  look  to  competition  to  keep  providers  of  an economic service from ignoring the wishes of their customers. But where violence  is  concerned,  direct  competition  often  has  perverse  results.  In the  past,  it  has  usually  led  to  increased  violence.  When  two  would-be protective  agencies  send  their  forces  to  arrest  one  another,  the  result  is more akin to civil war than protection. When you are seeking protection from  violence  you  normally  do  not  wish  to  increase  the  output  of violence but to suppress it. And to suppress it on terms that do not allow 206</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-208"></a>the plundering of the customers who pay for the protection service in the first place. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"...during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in</i> <i class="calibre3">awe, they are in that</i> <i class="calibre3">condition which is called war: and such a war as is</i> <i class="calibre3">of every man, against every man wherein</i> <i class="calibre3">men live without other security</i> <i class="calibre3">than what their own strength and their own inventions shall</i> <i class="calibre3">furnish them</i> <i class="calibre3">withal" </i> THOMAS HOBBES</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Monopoly and Anarchy</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This is why anarchy, or "the war of all against all," as Hobbes described it,  has  seldom  been  a  satisfactory  state  of  affairs.  Local  competition  in the use of violence has usually meant paying higher costs for protection and  enjoying  less  of  it.  Occasionally,  freethinking  enthusiasts  for  the market  have  suggested  that  market  mechanisms  alone  would  be sufficient to provide for policing of property rights and protection of life, 129</p>

<p class="calibre1">without any need for a sovereignty whatsoever.29 Some of the analytics have  been  elegant,  but  the  fact  remains  that  free-market  provision  of police and justice services has not proven viable under the megapolitical conditions  of  industrialism.  Only  primitive  societies  where  behavior  is highly stereotyped and populations are tiny and homogeneous have been able  to  survive  without  governments  to  provide  the  service  of  locally monopolizing protection through violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Examples  of  anarchic  societies  above  the  level  of  the  hunting-and-gathering  tribe  are  few  and  ancient.  They  are  all  among  the  simplest economies  of  isolated  rainwater  farmers.  The  Kafirs  in  pre-Muslim Afghanistan. Some Irish tribes in the Dark Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some Indian bands in Brazil, Venezuela, and Paraguay. Other aboriginals in  scattered  parts  of  the  world.  Their  methods  of  organizing  protection without government are known only to connoisseurs of extreme cases. If you would like to learn more about them, we cite several books in our Notes  that  contain  more  details.  30  Primitive  groups  were  able  to function  without  a  distinct  organization  specializing  in  violence  only because they were small, closed societies. And they were isolated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">207</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>They could draw on tight kinship relations to defend against most violent threats on a limited scale, which were the only sort they were likely to encounter.  When  they  encountered  larger  threats,  organized  by  states, they  were  overpowered  and  subjected  to  rule  monopolized  by  outside groups. This happened over and over. Wherever societies have formed at a  scale  above  bands  and  tribes,  especially  where  trade  routes  brought different  peoples  into  contact,  specialists  in  violence  have  always emerged  to  plunder  any  surplus  more  peaceful  people  could  produce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  technological  conditions  raised  the  returns  to  violence,  they doomed societies that were not organized to channel large resources into making war. </p>

LANE</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Government as a Seller of Protection</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  have  said  at  several  points,  government's  principal  economic function  from  the  perspective  of  those  who  pay  the  taxes  is  to  provide protection of life and property. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  the  government  often  operates  like  organized  crime,  extracting resources  from  people  within  its  sphere  of  operations  as  tribute  or plunder. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Government is not only a protection service; it is also a protection racket. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While government provides protection against violence originating with others, like the protection racket it also charges customers for protection against harm that it would otherwise impose itself. The first action is an economic service. The second is a racket. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In practice, the distinction between the two forms of "protection" may be difficult  to  make.  Governments,  as  Charles  Tilly  has  pointed  out,  may 208</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-210"></a>perhaps be best understood as "our largest examples of organized crime." </p>

<p class="calibre1">3</p>

<p class="calibre1">130</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  activities  of  even  the  best  government  usually  involved  some mixture of the economic service of protection combined with extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Historically,  both  pursuits  could  be  optimized  if  the  government  could impose  a  near-monopoly  on  coercion  within  the  territories  where  it operates.  In  cases  where  a  single  armed  group  could  establish predominance in the use of violence, the quality of the protection service it could provide was normally far superior to what could be had from one of  several  competing  protection  agencies  thrown  into  battle  over  the same territory. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A Natural Monopoly on Land</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Achievement  of  a  local  monopoly  of  coercion  not  only  allowed  a government  to  more  effectively  protect  its  potential  customers  from violence  initiated  by  others;  it  also  greatly  reduced  the  government's operating  costs.  As  Lane  put  it,  "The  violence-using,  violence-controlling  industry  was  a  natural  monopoly,  at  least  on  land.  Within territorial  limits,  the  service  it  rendered  could  be  produced  much  more cheaply by a monopoly."33</p>

<p class="calibre1">Thus  a  "monopoly  of  the  use  of  force  within  a  contiguous  territory enabled  a  protectionproducing  enterprise  to  improve  its  product  and reduce  its  costs."  Such  a  governing  organization  could  offer  more protection  with  less  expense  if  it  did  not  have  to  engage  in  incessant military  actions  to  fend  off  competitive  groups  seeking  to  extract protection payments from its customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Monopoly and Plunder</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  degree  of  the  local  monopoly  of  coercion  directly  affects  whether the  would-be  government  has  stronger  incentives  to  protect  people within  its  grasp  or  to  plunder  them.  Where  contending  groups  wrestle and maneuver in uneasy balance, the incentives to use predatory violence increase. Plunder becomes more attractive. Because power is less stable, 209</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-211"></a>and  the  local  monopoly  of  coercion  less  secure,  the  time  horizons  of those  with  the  capacity  to  employ  violence  shrinks.  The  "king  of  the mountain" may stand on such a slippery slope that he could not expect to survive  long  enough  to  realize  a  share  of  the  substantial  gains  that ultimately result from containing violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When that is the case, there is little to prevent those who command what passes  for  government  from  employing  their  power  to  terrorize  and pillage society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  logic  of  force,  therefore,  tells  you  that  the  more  competing  armed groups there are operating in any territory, the higher the likelihood that they  will  resort  to  predatory  violence.  Without  a  single  overwhelming power to suppress freelance violence, it tends to proliferate, and many of the gains of economic and social cooperation go up in smoke. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  damage  that  can  occur  when  violence  is  given  full  reign  in  a condition  of  anarchy  is  demonstrated  by  the  fate  of  China  under  the warlords in the 1920s. It is a story we recounted in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The competing warlords imposed great damage in areas where there was no single, overwhelming power to keep them in check. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  examples  of  Somalia,  Rwanda,  and  others  you  will  soon  see  on television offer a Technicolor proof that violent competition for control of territory does not yield the same immediate economic gains as other forms  of  competition.

The  roving  bandits  and  looters who  compete  under  anarchy  lack  even  the  weak  incentives  to  protect productive  activity  that  sometimes  lighten  even  the  heavy  hand  of dictators when their rule is secure. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE EVOLUTION OF PROTECTION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  developed  an  argument  that  we  have  misappropriated  for  our purposes in imagining how the Information Age may unfold. He argued that  the  history  of  Western  economies  since  the  Dark  Ages  can  be interpreted  in  terms  of  four  stages  of  competition  and  monopoly  in  the organization  of  violence.  While  Lane  is  largely  silent  about  the megapolitical  factors  that  we  identify  as  influencing  the  scale  at  which governments  operate,  his  exploration  of  the  economics  of  violence coincides  closely  with  the  argument  we  spelled  out  in   <i class="calibre3">Blood  in  the</i> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>; and elsewhere in this volume. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We have already analyzed some of the megapolitical factors that played a role in the evolution of Western society following the fall of Rome. </p>

<p class="calibre1">132</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane also examined this period, focusing on the economic consequences of that competition to monopolize violence. He discerned four important stages in the functioning of economies over the past thousand years, each involving a different phase in the organization of violence.* Out of the Dark Ages The first stage is one of "anarchy and plunder" that marked the  feudal  revolution  of  a  thousand  years  ago.  While  Lane  does  not specify  the  dates  for  any  of  his  summary  periods,  arithmetic  sets  the boundary of his first period quite clearly, and his description of the stage of "anarchy and plunder" seems to match conditions during the transition from the Dark Ages when the use of violence was "highly competitive, even  on  land."37  He  does  not  say  why,  but  when  violence  is  "highly competitive," this usually means that there are significant obstacles to the projection  of  power  at  any  distance.  In  military  terms,  defense  is predominant over the offense. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  explained  in  Chapter  3,  this  stage  of  "anarchy  and plunder" </p>

<p class="calibre1">212</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-214"></a>coincided with falling productivity of agriculture due to adverse climatic changes.  Since  technology  offered  few  effective  economies  of  scale  to help  in  securing  a  monopoly  of  violence  at  the  time,  competition between  would-be  rulers  was  widespread.  Economic  activity  was smothered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The weakness of the economy made the problem of establishing a stable order worse. To create a local monopoly of violence involved too high a cost  in  military  activity  in  proportion  to  the  meager  value  of  economic turnover. Without the capacity to enforce an effective monopoly over an economically viable territory, the armed knights on horseback terrorized and plundered while providing little in the way of "protection" </p>

<p class="calibre1">for their customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Feudalism</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">"The second stage begins when small regional or provincial monopolies are  established.  Agricultural  production  then  rises,  and  most  of  the surplus is collected by recently established monopolists of violence." 38</p>

<p class="calibre1">Still, the surplus is relatively meager during this second stage, which we identify with the early Middle Ages. Economic growth is held down by the absence of advantages of scale in the organization of violence, which keeps  the  military  costs  of  enforcing  local  monopolies  high.  But  while the  costs  remain  high,  the  price  that  minisovereignties  can  charge  for protection  rises,  since  economic  activity  expands  when  anarchy  is curtailed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">*********Note that Lane's four stages of competition and monopoly in the use of violence are different from the four stages in the organization of  economic  life  that  we  identify-namely,  foraging,  farming, industrialism, and the Information Age. *********</p>

<p class="calibre1">During  a  late  phase  of  the  second  stage  many  tribute  takers  attract customers  by  special  offers  to  agricultural  and  commercial  enterprise. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They offer protection at low prices for those who will bring new lands into cultivation, and special policing services to encourage trade such as that organized by the Counts of Champagne for merchants 133</p>

<p class="calibre1">213</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-215"></a>coming  to  their  fairs."  39  In  other  words,  when  they  were  able  to establish  a  sufficient  control  over  territory  to  negotiate  credibly,  local warlords did what local merchants do when they need to increase market share:  they  discounted  their  services  to  attract  customers.  The  warlords later  used  the  added  resources  from  additional  economic  activity  to consolidate  their  control  over  larger  territories.  Once  that  control  was firmly  established,  they  began  to  enjoy  more  of  the  advantages  of monopoly. Their military costs for policing tended to fall, and they could also  increase  the  price  they  charged  without  worrying  that  this  made their service less attractive to customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In this complicated stage in Western history, those who employ violence, the  medieval  lords  and  monarchs,  take  most  of  the  surplus  above subsistence. There are few merchants. The most successful are those who are  best  able  to  evade  or  minimize  the  taxes,  fees,  and  other  costs imposed by those demanding money for "protection services." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Early-Modern Period A third stage is reached when the merchants and landowners who are not also specialists in violence "are getting more of the economy's surplus than are fief holders and monarchs. . . . In this third stage, the enterprises specializing in the use of violence receive less of  the  surplus  than  do  enterprises  that  buy  protection  from  the governments."40 Since successful merchants are more likely to reinvest their profits than consume them, the higher profits of merchants in that stage in history led to self-reinforcing growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Factory Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  identifies  the  passage  from  the  third  to  the  fourth  stage  with  the emergence of technological and industrial innovations as more important factors in earning profits than lowering the costs of protection. By this, Lane seems to refer to the period since 1750. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From  that  time  on,  the  character  of  technology  began  to  play  a  clearly dominating  role  in  the  prosperity  of  regions.  To  take  an  extreme  ease, even areas where no government existed at all, as was the case in some parts  of  New  Zealand,  for  example,  prior  to  1840,  were  not  likely  to become  highly  prosperous  simply  because  they  paid  no  taxes.  At  that point  in  history,  innovations  in  industrial  technology  were  more 214</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-216"></a>important  to  achieving  profits  than  any  savings  that  could  be  had  by lowering  the  costs  for  protection,  even  to  zero.  As  the  scale  of government  rose,  the  credit  and  financing  mechanisms  originally pioneered  by  governments  to  raise  resources  for  military  operations became available to finance business enterprises of larger scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Although  Lane  does  not  say  so,  the  concentration  of  technological advantages  in  a  given  locale  reduced  the  competition  between jurisdictions  and  allowed  "enterprises  specializing  in  the  use  of violence," or governments, to charge higher prices. When there are large technological  gaps  between  the  competitors  in  one  jurisdiction  and another,  as  there  were  during  the  Industrial  Age,  entrepreneurs  in  the jurisdictions  with  the  best  technology  tend  to  make  more  money,  even though  they  may  have  to  pay  higher  taxes  and  other  costs  to  their governments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">134</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Plunder with a Smile</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  in  the  Industrial  Age  enjoyed  a  delightful  monopoly  to exploit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  actual  costs  for  providing  protection  of  life  and  limb  were vanishingly small relative to the prices (taxes) they charged. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet they really were in a realm where competition was so perverse that they  could  engage  far  more  in  the  business  of  plunder  than  in  that  of protection  and  still  have  that  fact  go  all  but  unnoticed.  It  was  a  rare moment in history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  drawbacks  of  anarchy  under  the  megapolitical  conditions  of industrialism  made  competition  in  protection  services  within  the  same territory  technologically  infeasible.  The  only  way  to  achieve  effective protection under those conditions was to command a greater capability to employ violence. Therefore there was little to be gained by attempting to better distinguish that portion of one's taxes that went, in Lane's words, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"as  payment  for  the  service  rendered"  from  "another  part  that  one  is tempted to call plunder."41 The distinction was surely real enough. But 215</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-217"></a>since one was stuck paying the taxes in any event, developing it fully had little to commend it other than satisfying morbid curiosity. As Lane said, no  matter  what  portion  of  the  taxes  was  plunder  they  were  a  price  one had to pay "to avoid more severe losses." 4</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Rise of Incomes Under Industrialism</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Part  of  the  reason  this  dilemma  was  tolerable  during  the  past  two centuries of domination by the nationstate was the fact that incomes were rising dramatically, particularly in the jurisdictions where most industrial development was confined. Those running the OECD governments took a higher percentage of incomes almost every year. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But the increase in plunder was nonetheless accompanied by far greater prosperity, and a greater inequality of wealth with the rest of the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  such  conditions,  objections  to  the  surge  of  taxation  were inevitably  marginal  and  insufficient  to  deflect  events  from  their  logical progression.  Indeed,  for  reasons  spelled  out  in  previous  chapters,  the military  survival  of  an  industrial  nationstate  largely  depended  upon  the fact  that  no  effective  limits  could  be  placed  upon  its  claims  on  the resources of its citizens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  every  industrial  state,  policies  meandered  in  more  or  less  the  same direction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At the high-water mark of industrialism after World War II, the rate of marginal income taxes reached 90 percent or higher. This was a far more aggressive  assertion  of  the  right  of  the  state  to  extract  resources  than even the Oriental despots of the early hydraulic civilizations were prone to  make.  Yet  the  industrial  version  of  plunder  followed  its  own  logic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Much of it was determined by the character of industrial technology in the first half of the twentieth century that we described earlier. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This technology made it all but inevitable that the state would seize and redistribute  a  large  fraction  of  income,  with  much  of  the  burden  of  the plunder  falling  upon  a  small  segment  of  capitalists.  Most  industrial processes  were  heavily  dependent  on  natural  resources,  and  therefore tied to the sites where the resources were located. A steel mill, a mine, or a port could be moved only at staggering expense, or not at all. Such 135</p>

<p class="calibre1">216</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-218"></a>facilities  were  therefore  stationary  targets  that  could  easily  be  taxed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Property, corporate, and severance taxes grew sharply over this century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">So  did  income  taxes,  first  on  the  capitalists,  but  eventually  on  the workers  themselves.  The  advent  of  large-scale  industrial  employment made a broadly based income tax practical. Wages could be garnished at the  source,  with  the  tax  authorities  coordinating  collections  with  the accounting  departments  of  industrial  firms.  We  take  this  for  granted today, but collecting an income tax at the factory gate was a far simpler task  than  fanning  out  over  the  countryside  to  squeeze  a  portion  of  the profits from millions of independent craftsmen and farmers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, industrial technology tended to make taxation more routineized, more  predictable,  and  less  personally  dangerous  than  taxation  in  many earlier periods. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, it extracted a higher percentage of society's resources than any form of sovereignty had done before. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Protecting What? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that societies could become richer while the total percentage of income  absorbed  in  taxes  rose  significantly  invites  a  question  about character  of  the  protection  that  governments  provided  to  industrial economies. What were they protecting? Our answer: primarily industrial installations  with  high  capital  costs  and  significant  vulnerability  to attack. The presence of large-scale industrial firms would not have been possible  in  a  disordered  environment  with  more  competitive  violence, even if the result of the competition had been to shrink the overall share of output taken by government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is why capital-intensive operations are uneconomic in the American slums,  as  well  as  in  Third  World  societies  where  ad  hoc  violence  is endemic.  Industrial  society  as  a  whole  was  able  to  proceed  because  a certain  kind  of  order  was  established  and  maintained.  Enterprises  were subject to regular, predictable shakedowns, rather than erratic violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even during the height of industrialism, it was always an exaggeration to speak  of  a  government  employing  a  "monopoly  of  force."  All governments  try  to  maintain  such  a  monopoly,  but  as  we  have  seen, 217</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-219"></a>employees of industrial corporations usually found that they were able to employ violence against their employers. As long as the general public has access to any arms at all, or a disorderly crowd retains the physical capacity to overturn a bus or throw rocks at police, those who control the government  do  not  totally  monopolize  force.  They  merely  control predominant force, dominant to a degree that it becomes uneconomic for most people to compete with them under existing conditions. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Information Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The Information Age is bringing into being a fifth stage in the evolution of  competition  in  the  use  of  violence  in  the  West.  This  stage  was  not anticipated by Lane. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This fifth phase involves competition in cyberspace, an arena not subject to monopolization by any "violence-using enterprise." It is not subject to monopolization because it is not a territory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">136</p>

<p class="calibre1">Although  Lane's  argument  incorporates  conventional  postwar assumptions  about  the  inevitability  of  the  nationstate,  he  recognized  a point  that  will  be  more  crucial  to  understanding  the  future  than  it  may have seemed forty or fifty years ago. That is the fact that governments have never established stable monopolies of coercion over the open sea. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Think  about  it.  No  government's  laws  have  ever  exclusively  applied there. This is a matter of the utmost importance in understanding how the organization  of  violence  and  protection  will  evolve  as  the  economy migrates into cyberspace, which has no physical existence at all. For the same reasons that Lane noted in observing that no government has ever been able to monopolize violence on the sea, it is even less likely that a government  could  successfully  monopolize  an  infinite  realm  without physical boundaries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">218</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-220"></a><b class="calibre4">COMPETITION WITHOUT ANARCHY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  past,  when  conditions  made  it  difficult  for  any  single  violence-wielding  entity  to  establish  a  monopoly,  the  results  were  anarchy  and plunder.  The  Information  Age,  however,  has  changed  the  technological terms under which violence is organized and done so in a profound way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike the past, when the inability to monopolize protection in a region meant  higher  military  costs  and  lower  economic  returns,  the  fact  that governments  cannot  monopolize  cyberspace  actually  implies  lower military costs and higher economic returns. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  because  information  technology  creates  a  new  dimension  in protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  time  in  history,  information  technology  allows  for  the creation and protection of assets that lie entirely outside the realm of any individual government's territorial monopoly on violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Countries  in  which  the  units  of  political  power  and  governance  are</i> <i class="calibre3">multiple  and  which  lack  a</i> <i class="calibre3">central,  stable,  unchallenged  supervisory</i> <i class="calibre3">source  of  jurisdiction  and  power  have  to  devise  their</i> <i class="calibre3">own  working</i> <i class="calibre3">solutions for dealing with the problems raised by such frontiers."4 </i> REES</p>

<p class="calibre1">DAVIES</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Analogy with the Frontier</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Cyberspace is in one sense the equivalent of a technologically protected march region of the kind that existed in border areas during the Middle Ages. In the past, when the reach of lords and kings was weak, and the claims  of  one  or  more  overlapped  at  a  frontier,  something  akin  to competitive  government  existed.  A  look  at  how  the  march  regions functioned could give insights into how laws of the march or something like them may migrate into cyberspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Andorra  survives  as  a  kind  of  fossilized  march  region  between  France and  Spain,  an  artifact  of  megapolitical  conditions  that  made  it  difficult for  either  kingdom  to  dominate  the  other  in  that  cold  and  almost inaccessible  area  of  190  square  miles  in  the  Pyrenees.  In  1278,  an 219</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-221"></a>agreement  was  struck  dividing  suzerainty  over  Andorra  between  local French  and  Spanish  feudal  lords,  the  French  count  of  Foix  and  the Spanish  bishop  of  Urgel.  Each  appointed  one  of  two  "viquiers"  who sparingly exercised the minimal 137</p>

<p class="calibre1">authority  of  government  in  Andorra,  mostly  by  commanding  the  tiny Andorran militia, now a police force. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  count's  role  was  long  ago  superseded  by  history.  The  French government  now  stands  in  for  him  from  Paris.  Among  its  duties  is  to accept half of the annual tribute that Andorra pays, an amount less than a single month's rent in a fleabag apartment. The bishop of Urgel continues to  receive  his  share  of  the  tribute,  just  as  his  predecessors  did  in  the Middle Ages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the split tribute implies, there have been two sources of "supervisory jurisdiction  and  power"  rather  than  one  in  Andorra.  Appeals  from Andorran civil suits were traditionally lodged either with the Episcopal College of Urgel or the Court of Cassation in Paris. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A consequence of Andorra's ambiguous position was that almost no laws were enacted. Andorra has enjoyed vanishingly small government and no taxes for more than seven hundred years. Today, that gives it a growing appeal as a tax haven. But until a generation ago, Andorra was famously poor.  Once  thickly  wooded,  it  was  deforested  over  the  centuries  by residents  trying  to  stay  warm  in  the  bitter  winters.  The  whole  place  is snowed shut from November through April each year. Even in summer, Andorra  is  so  cold  that  crops  grow  only  on  the  southern  slopes.  If  our description makes it seem unappealing, you have just learned the secret of  its  success.  Andorra  survived  as  a  feudal  enclave  in  the  age  of  the nationstate because it was remote and dirt-poor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At one time, there were numerous medieval frontier or "march" regions where  sovereignties  blended  together.  These  violent  frontiers  persisted for  decades  or  sometimes  for  centuries  in  the  border  areas  of  Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most were poor. As we mentioned earlier, there were marches between areas  of  Celtic  and  English  control  in  Ireland;  between  Wales  and England,  Scotland  and  England,  Italy  and  France,  France  and  Spain, Germany  and  the  Slav  frontiers  of  Central  Europe,  and  between  the 220</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-222"></a>Christian kingdoms of Spain and the Islamic kingdom of Granada. Like Andorra,  these  march  regions  developed  distinct  institutional  and  legal forms of a kind that we are likely to see again in the next millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, each of which was  weak,  rulers  would  sometimes  even  solicit  volunteers  among  their subjects to settle in march regions in order to increase the reach of their authority.  Almost  as  a  matter  of  course,  the  subjects  were  lured  into settling in the march by freedom from taxes. Given the delicate margins upon  which  they  competed,  if  either  authority  in  a  march  attempted  to impose taxes, he would make it more difficult for his followers to make ends  meet,  as  well  as  give  everyone  a  reason  to  affiliate  with  his competitor.  Therefore,  residents  of  a  march  usually  had  a  choice  in deciding whose laws they were to obey. This choice was based upon the weakness of the competing authorities; it was not an ideological gesture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, practical difficulties arose that had to be resolved. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under  feudalism,  landlords  who  owned  property  on  both  sides  of  a nominal frontier faced a serious conflict of duties. For example, a lord on the  frontier  of  Scotland  and  England  who  held  properties  in  both kingdoms could theoretically owe military service to both in the event of war. To resolve this contradictory obligation, almost 138</p>

<p class="calibre1">everyone up and down the feudal hierarchy could choose whose laws to obey through a legal process called avowal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  will  create  equivalent  opportunities  for competitive choice in domiciling economic activities, but with important differences. One is that unlike the medieval frontier societies, cyberspace is  likely  to  be  in  due  course  the  richest  of  economic  realms.  It  will therefore tend to be a growing rather than a receding frontier. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Few persons at the core regions of medieval society would have wished to  move  to  frontiers  without  strong  inducements,  often  including religious  imperatives,  because  these  regions  tended  to  be  violent  and poor. Therefore, they did not act as magnets drawing resources out of the control of the authorities. Cyberspace will. </p>

<p class="calibre1">221</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-223"></a>Secondly, the new frontier will not be a duopoly, which invites collusion between  the  two  authorities  to  compromise  over  their  frontier  claims. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such compromises tended not to be effective during the medieval period for  two  reasons:  there  were  frequently  sharp  cultural  gaps  between  the rival authorities; and more important, they lacked the physical capacity to impose a negotiated settlement, having insufficient military power on the ground. During the era of the nationstate, when national authorities did come to exercise sufficient military power to impose solutions, most march regions and vague frontiers disappeared. Border fixing became the norm. That is a stable solution if duopolists of violence face the prospect of dividing their authority over contiguous regions. But the competition in domiciling transactions in the cybereconomy will not be between two authorities, but between hundreds of authorities throughout the globe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For the territorial states to create an effective cartel to keep tax rates high will  be  all  but  impossible.  This  will  be  true  for  the  same  reason  that collusion  to  enjoy  monopoly  prices  in  markets  with  hundreds  of competitors does not work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For evidence, consider the move by the Seychelles, a tiny country in the Indian  Ocean,  to  enact  a  new  investment  law  that  U.S.  government officials describe as a "Welcome Criminals" act. Under the law, anyone who  invests  $10  million  in  the  Seychelles  will  not  only  be  guaranteed protection  against  extradition,  but  will  be  issued  a  diplomatic  passport. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Contrary to the assertions of the U.S. government, however, the intended beneficiaries are not drug dealers, who are generally under the protection of  more  important  governments  in  any  event,  but  independent entrepreneurs who have become politically incorrect. The first potential beneficiary of the Seychelles law is a white South African who became wealthy  by  circumventing  the  economic  sanctions  against  the  former apartheid  regime.  Now  he  faces  the  danger  of  economic  retribution  by the new South African government and is willing to pay the Seychelles for protection.4</p>

<p class="calibre1">Whatever  the  merits  of  any  individual  case,  the  example  shows  why attempts  by  governments  to  maintain  a  cartel  for  protection  on  the ground are doomed to failure. </p>

<p class="calibre1">222</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-224"></a>Unlike the medieval frontier, in which the competition was between two authorities only, the frontier in cybercommerce will be between hundreds of jurisdictions, with the number probably rising rapidly to thousands. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the age of the virtual corporation, individuals will choose to domicile their  income-earning  activities  in  a  jurisdiction  that  provides  the  best service at the lowest cost. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  sovereignty  will  be  commercialized.  Unlike  medieval frontier  societies,  which  were  in  most  cases  impoverished  and  violent, cyberspace will be neither. The 139</p>

<p class="calibre1">competition  that  information  technology  is  driving  governments  to engage  in  is  not  competition  of  a  military  kind,  but  competition  in quality  and  price  of  an  economic  service-genuine  protection.  In  short, governments will be obliged to give customers what they want. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Diminished Utility of Violence</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  governments  will  resign  from employing  violence.  Far  from  it.  Rather,  what  we  are  saying  is  that violence is losing a good deal of its leverage. One possible reaction on the  part  of  governments  would  be  to  intensify  their  use  of  violence  in local  settings  in  an  attempt  to  compensate  for  its  declining  global significance. Whatever governments do, however, they will be unable to saturate  cyberspace  with  violence  in  the  way  that  they  saturated  the territories  they  monopolized  with  violence  in  the  modern  world.  No matter how many governments try to enter cyberspace, they will be no more capable or powerful in that realm than anyone else. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  attempts  by  nationstates  to  wage  "information  wars"  to dominate or thwart access to cyberspace would probably only accelerate their own demise. The tendency toward the devolution of large systems is already powerful because of the fall away of scale economies and the rising costs of holding fragmenting social groups together. The irony of information wars is that they could well impose more of a shock to the brittle  systems  left  over  from  the  Industrial  Age  than  to  the  emerging information economy itself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">223</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-225"></a>As  long  as  essential  information  technology  continues  to  function, cybercommerce  could  proceed  in  tandem  with  the  struggles  of information war in a way that could never happen in a territorial war. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You could not imagine millions of commercial transactions taking place at the front in one of the twentieth century's wars. But virtual wars may not exhaust any capacity of cyberspace to host multiple activities. And because  virtual  reality  does  not  exist,  there  will  be  little  danger  of proximity, and almost none of being hit by exploding virtual shrapnel. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Vulnerability of Large-Scale Systems</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  dangers  of  information  war  will  mostly  be  dangers  to  large-scale industrial systems that operate with central command and control. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Military  authorities  in  the  United  States  and  other  leading  nationstates are both planning for and fearing acts of information sabotage that could have  severe  consequences  for  disabling  large  systems.  An  act  of cyberwarfare could close down a telephone switching station, disrupt air traffic control, or sabotage a pumping system that regulates the flow of water to a city. A programmed virus could even close down conventional or nuclear generators, turning off segments of the electric grid. So-called logic  bombs  could  scramble  a  great  deal  of  information,  the  most sensitive  of  which  is  in  central  control  systems  operating  vulnerable, large-scale systems inherited from the 140</p>

<p class="calibre1">Industrial Age. Short of a massive and comprehensive destruction of all information technology, which would bring the world economy literally to  a  halt,  cybercommerce  and  virtual  reality  will  remain  beyond  the capacity of any government to stifle, much less monopolize. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  one  of  the  signal  drawbacks  of  information  technology,  the apparent  vulnerability  of  information-storage  systems  to  decay  and destruction,  has  been  largely  resolved  by  new  archival  technology.  A new  system  called  "High-Density  read-only  Memory,"  or  "HD-ROM," </p>

<p class="calibre1">employs  an  ion  mill  similar  to  those  used  in  computer-aided manufacturing systems to create archives in a vacuum. Storage capacity is  now  as  high  as  25,000  megabytes  per  square  inch.  Unlike  earlier systems  that  were  vulnerable  to  early  decay  and  disruption  by  shock, 224</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-226"></a>data stored in HD-ROM promises to be around for the duration. One of HD-ROM's developers, Bruce Lamartine, says, "It's virtually impervious to  the  ravages  of  time,  thermal  and  mechanical  shock,  or  the electromagnetic fields that are so destructive to other storage mediums." </p>

<p class="calibre1">45  Even  the  detonation  of  a  blast  by  nuclear  terrorists  would  not necessarily  scramble  or  destroy  vital  information,  such  as  the  codes  to digital  money,  upon  which  the  smooth  functioning  of  a  cybereconomy will depend. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  assumptions  of  the  nationstate  at  war  will  make  less  and  less megapolitical  sense  as  the  importance  of  information  in  warfare increases. Because it has no physical existence, cyberspace is not a realm in which magnitudes as we know them in the physical world carry any commanding  importance.  It  does  not  matter  how  many  programmers were involved in stipulating a sequence of commands. All that matters is whether  the  program  functions.  The  Sovereign  Individual  may  truly count for as much in cyberspace as does a nationstate, with its seat in the UN,  its  own  flag,  and  an  army  deployed  on  the  ground.  In  purely economic  terms,  some  Sovereign  Individuals  already  command investible  incomes  in  the  hundreds  of  millions  annually,  sums  that exceed  the  discretionary  spending  power  of  some  of  the  bankrupt nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  that  is  not  all.  In  terms  of  virtual  warfare  waged  through  the manipulation  of  information,  some  individuals  may  loom  as  large  or larger than many of the world's states. One bizarre genius, working with digital  servants,  could  theoretically  achieve  the  same  impact  in  a cyberwar as a nationstate. Bill Gates certainly could. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In this sense, the age of the Sovereign Individual is not merely a slogan. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A hacker, or a small group of mathematicians, not to mention a company like  Microsoft,  or  almost  any  computer  software  company,  could  in principle do any or all of the things that the Pentagon's Cyber War Task Force  has  up  its  sleeves.  There  are  hundreds  of  firms  in  the  Silicon Valley  and  elsewhere  that  already  have  a  greater  capacity  to  wage  a cyberwar than 90 percent of the existing nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">141</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  presumption  that  governments  will  continue  to  monopolize  life  on the ground as alternative avenues for protection open on all sides is an anachronism. A far more likely outcome is that nationstates will have to be  reconfigured  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  to  computer  viruses,  logic bombs,  infected  wires,  and  trapdoor  programs  that  could  be  monitored by the U.S. National Security Agency, or some teenage hacker. </p>

<p class="calibre1">226</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-228"></a>The  megapolitical  logic  of  cyberspace  suggests  that  central  command-and-control  systems  that  currently  dominate  the  world's  large-scale infrastructure will have to be replaced by multicentric models of security with distributed capabilities so they cannot be easily captured or blocked by  a  computer  virus.  New  types  of  software,  known  as  agoric  open systems, will replace command-and-control software inherited from the Industrial  Age.  That  older  software  allocated  computational  capacity according  to  rigid  priorities  in  much  the  same  way  that  the  central planners at Gosplan in the former Soviet Union used to allocate goods to boxcars by rigid rules. The new systems are controlled by algorithms that mock  market  mechanisms  to  allocate  resources  more  efficiently  by  an internal  bidding  process  that  mimics  the  competitive  processes  in  the brain.  Instead  of  giant  computer  monopolies  conducting  important command-and-control  functions,  they  will  be  decentralized  in  the  new millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  better  example  of  the  resilience  of  distributed  networks compared  to  command-and-control  systems  than  that  given  by  Digital Equipment at its Palo Alto research lab. An engineer opened the door to a closet that housed the company's own computer network. As recounted by Kevin Kelly, the engineer dramatically "yanked a cable out of its guts. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The network routed around the breach and didn't falter a bit."4</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Information Age will not only facilitate competition without anarchy in cyberspace; it will inevitably lead to the redesign of important systems left over from industrialism. Such a reconfiguration is essential to make them  less  vulnerable  to  mischief  that  could  come  from  anyone  or anywhere. Just as the Industrial Age inevitably led to the reconfiguration of  institutions  that  were  left  over  from  the  medieval  period,  such  as schools and universities, so the leftover institutions of the Industrial Age are likely to devolve in miniature form, in ways that reflect the logic of microtechnology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  need  for  protection  against  bandits  on  the  Information Superhighway  will  require  widespread  adopting  of  public  key-private key encryption algorithms. These already allow any individual user of a personal  computer  to  encode  any  message  more  securely  than  the Pentagon could have sealed its launch codes only a generation ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">227</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-229"></a>These  powerful,  unbreakable  forms  of  encryption  will  be  necessary  to secure financial transactions from hackers and thieves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  also  be  necessary  for  another  reason.  Private  financial institutions  and  central  banks  will  adopt  unbreakable  encryption algorithms when they realize that the U.S. government-and it may not be alone-has the capacity to penetrate current bank software and computer systems  to  literally  bankrupt  a  country  or  sweep  the  bank  account  of anyone  living  almost  anywhere.  There  is  no  technological  reason  why any  individual  or  any  country  should  leave  his  financial  deposits  or transactions at the mercy of the U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">National Security Agency or the successors to the KGB, or any similar organization, licit or illicit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Encryption algorithms impenetrable by governments are not daydreams. </p>

<p class="calibre1">142</p>

<p class="calibre1">They  are  available  already  as  shareware  over  the  Internet.  When  low-orbit  satellite  systems  are  fully  operable,  individuals  using  advanced personal  computers  with  antennae  no  larger  than  those  on  portable phones will be able to communicate anywhere on the globe without even interfacing with the telephone system. It will no more be possible for a government  to  monopolize  cyberspace,  a  realm  with  no  physical existence at all, than it would have been for medieval knights to control transactions in the industrial period astride a heavy charger. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Protection by Stealth</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Information  societies  will  place  vast  resources  outside  the  realm  of predation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  cyberspace  comes  increasingly  to  host  financial  transactions  and other forms of commerce, the resources employed there will be more or less immune to ordinary shakedowns and theft. Therefore, predators will be unable to harness as large a share of resources as they do today and have done through much of the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">228</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-230"></a>Inevitably, therefore, government protection of a large part of the world's wealth  will  be  redundant.  Government  will  be  no  better  situated  to protect a bank balance in cyberspace than you are. As government will be less necessary, its relative price is likely to fall for that reason alone. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There are others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">With  a  large  and  growing  share  of  financial  transactions  occurring  in cyberspace  in  the  new  millennium,  individuals  will  have  a  choice  of jurisdictions in which to lodge them. This will create intense competition to  price  government's  services  (the  taxes  it  charges)  on  a nonmonopolistic basis. This is revolutionary. As George Melloan argued in The Wall Street Journal, the one institution that has most successfully resisted the forces of global competition has been the welfare state. "A study by researchers at the Wharton School and the Australian National University  discussed  the  forces  coming  to  bear  on  income  transfers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Geoffrey Garrett and Deborah Mitchell concluded that 'there is virtually no  evidence  that  increased  market  integration  has  put  downward pressures on their most fundamental welfare programs.' To the contrary, they  write,  'governments  have  invariably  responded  to  increased integration  into  international  markets  by  increasing  income  transfers.' </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  advent  of  the  cybereconomy  will  at  long  last  finally  expose  the welfare  state  to  genuine  competition.  It  will  change  the  nature  of sovereignties  and  transform  economies,  as  the  balance  between protection  and  extortion  swings  more  completely  on  the  side  of protection than it has ever done before. </p>

The  Internet  is  too  widespread  to  be  easily</i> <i class="calibre3">dominated  by  any  single</i> <i class="calibre3">government.

<p class="calibre1">The  Information  Superhighway  has  become  one  of  the  more  familiar metaphors of the early days of the digital age. It is remarkable not only for  its  pervasiveness,  but  also  for  the  common  misunderstanding  it betrays  about  the  cybereconomy.  A  highway,  after  all,  is  an  industrial version  of  a  footpath,  a  network  for  the  physical  transit  of  people  and goods. The information economy is not like a highway, a railroad, or a pipeline. It does not haul or transport information from point to point the way  the  Trans-Canada  Highway  carries  heavy  trucks  from  Alberta  to New Brunswick. What the world calls the "Information Superhighway" </p>

<p class="calibre1">is not merely a transit link. It is the destination. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Cyberspace transcends locality</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">It  involves  nothing  less  than  the  instantaneous  sharing  of  data everywhere and nowhere at once. The emerging information economy is based in the interconnections linking and relinking millions of users of millions of computers. Its essence lies in the new possibilities that arise from  these  connections.  As  John  Perry  Barlow  put  it,  "What  the  Net offers  is  the  promise  of  a  new  social  space,  global  and  anti-sovereign, within  which  anybody,  anywhere  can  express  to  the  rest  of  humanity whatever he or she believes without fear. There is in these new media a foreshadowing of the intellectual and economic liberty that might undo all the authoritarian powers on earth." 2</p>

<p class="calibre1">Cyberspace, like the imaginary realm of Homer's gods, is a realm apart from  the  familiar  terrestrial  world  of  farm  and  factory.  Yet  its consequences will not be imaginary, but real. To a far greater extent than 230</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-232"></a>many now understand, the instantaneous sharing of information will be like a solvent dissolving large institutions. It will not only alter the logic of  violence,  as  we  have  already  explored;  it  will  radically  alter information  and  transaction  costs  that  determine  how  businesses organize  and  the  way  the  economy  functions.  We  expect microprocessing to change the economic organization of the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-233"></a><b class="calibre4">THE TYRANNY OF PLACE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  the  fading  industrial  era's  first  stab  at  conceiving  the information economy is to think of it in terms of a gigantic public works project  tells  you  how  grounded  our  thinking  is  in  the  paradigms  of  the past. It is rather like hearing farmers at the end of the eighteenth century describe  a  factory  as  "a  farm  with  a  roof."  Yet  the  "superhighway" </p>

<p class="calibre1">metaphor is more revealing than that. It also betrays the extent to which we are hostage to the tyranny of place. Even when technology enables us to  transcend  locality,  the  instrument  of  our  deliverance  is  given  a nickname describing it as a route from place to place. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like salmon marked by their homing instinct, our consciousness is still deeply etched by notions of locality. For the whole of history until now, economies  have  been  tethered  to  a  local  geographic  area.  Most  people who  lived  before  the  twentieth  century  passed  their  days  like  defacto prisoners  under  house  arrest,  seldom  venturing  more  than  a  few  days' </p>

<p class="calibre1">walk  from  where  they  were  born.  A  journey  of  any  distance  was  the work of generations. Only occasionally did some crisis war, pestilence, an adverse shift in climate stimulate a broad migration. To move human beings  out  of  a  wretched  village  required  something  spectacular  and pressing.  Nothing  less  could  stimulate  people  to  bundle  up  their belongings and wander off in search of a better life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Until  recently,  the  few  who  looked  outside  their  own  locale  for opportunity  often  became  famous.  Consider  that  Marco  Polo  is  still renowned for having traipsed the Eurasian continent to visit the court of the Great Khan. He was the exception in his time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Few  other  travelogues  survive  from  the  premodern  period.  Among  the more  widely  read,  Mandeville's  Travels,  written  in  French  in  1357,  is notable for having been composed by someone who probably never left Europe.  Mandeville  conveys  delightful  and  often  fanciful  details  about life  around  the  globe,  including  the  suggestion  that  many  Ethiopians have only one foot: "[T]he foot is so large that it shadoweth all the body against  the  sun  when  they  will  lie  and  rest  them."  3  Clearly,  few  of 232</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-234"></a>Mandeville's  contemporaries  who  read  his  popular  story  were  likely  to have known that his Ethiopian "Bigfoot" did not exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not until the modern age began with the journeys of exploration at the very end of the fifteenth century were there sustained contacts between the continents. Intrepid captains like Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama who set out to capture the spice trade were extraordinary enough to be remembered in every literate household for the better part of five centuries. From the advent of farming until recent generations, life was characterized  by  its  immobility.  This  is  all  but  forgotten  today, particularly  in  the  European  settlement  colonies  of  the  "New  World," </p>

<p class="calibre1">where  movement  is  more  fluid  and  everyone  tends  to  draw  his perspective  from  the  vantage  point  of  an  immigrant.  A  theme  of elementary education in North America is that the colonists came from Europe seeking freedom and opportunity, which is true. What is seldom told, however, is how reluctant 145</p>

<p class="calibre1">most  people  were  to  take  the  trip,  even  when  faced  with  destitution  at home.  The  few  who  did  migrate  suffered  what  are  in  today's  terms unimaginable ordeals to establish themselves. Only the most enterprising or the most desperate of the poor came. In the middle of the seventeenth century,  inmates  locked  up  in  Bridewell,  London's  notorious  house  of correction, revolted to show "their unwillingness to go to Virginia." 4 In 1720, there were riots in the streets of Paris to free vagabonds, thieves, and murderers scheduled for deportation to Louisiana. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Narrow Horizons</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Physical  difficulties  of  communication  and  transport,  compounded  at most  times  and  places  by  limited  language  skills,  kept  the  focus  of human action narrow and local. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  recently  as  the  early  twentieth  century,  it  was  common  to  find Chinese  villages  lying  only  five  miles  apart  speaking  mutually unintelligible  dialects,  even  along  the  coast.  The  local  organization  of almost  all  economies  imposed  a  penalty  of  narrow  markets  and  lost opportunity.  Factor  costs  were  kept  high  due  to  limited  competition. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Access  to  specialized  skills  was  minimal.  With  incomes  so  low  they scraped  the  margins  of  destitution,  and  no  access  to  outside  capital  or 233</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-235"></a>efficient  insurance  markets,  small  farmers  in  much  of  the  world  were trapped  in  poverty.  We  have  explored  some  of  the  difficulties  imposed upon  peasants  by  the  confines  of  closed  village  life.  Even  now,  as  we write,  at  least  a  billion  people,  mostly  in  Asia  and  Africa,  struggle  to survive on less than a dollar a day. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">"ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL" </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">To a greater extent than is commonly realized, the immobility of people and their assets has informed the way we see the world. Even those who seem most ready to agree that the earth is a small place as the twentieth century  ends  continue  to  think  in  terms  constrained  by  antiquated concepts  of  industrial  politics.  This  is  underscored  by  a  slogan  that became popular among environmentalists in the 1980s: "Think globally but  act  locally."  It  is  an  injunction  that  mirrors  the  logic  of  politics,  a logic that has always turned on local power advantages. The local habit of  mind  has  been  dictated  by  the  megapolitics  of  all  past  societies.  All topographical features that serve as barriers or facilitators to the exercise of  power  are  local.  Every  river,  every  mountain,  every  island  is  local. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Climate  is  local.  Temperature,  rainfall,  and  growing  conditions  vary  as you  climb  up  and  over  a  mountain.  Every  microbe  that  circulates, circulates somewhere, and not in some other place. Little wonder that the tyranny  of  place  permeates  our  concepts  of  how  society  must  organize and  function.  The  power  advantages  that  have  given  one  group  or another a local monopoly on violence have heretofore always originated someplace and faded along the megapolitical margins where borders are drawn. That is why there has never been a world government. While the importance  of  place  to  the  exercise  of  power  has  rarely  been  made explicit,  some  advocates  of  compulsion  to  redistribute  the  rewards  of human action began to sense the declining leverage of place as 146</p>

<p class="calibre1">long ago as the 1930s. They saw in modern transportation a division of social  space  between  the  highly  paid  and  the  poor.  This  fear  was captured  by  John  Dos  Passos  in   <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Big Money</i>:  "The  'vag'  sits  on  the edge of the highway, broken, hungry. Overhead, flies a transcontinental plane filled with highly paid executives. The upper class has taken to the air,  the  lower  class  to  the  road:  there  is  no  longer  any  bond  between them,  they  are  two  nations."5  This  is  another  way  of  saying  that improved  transportation  reduced  the  leverage  of  extortion  simply  by 234</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-236"></a>increasing the choice of places where successful persons might choose to be. Certainly, the vagabond on the road below was in no position to press for  a  handout  from  those  flying  overhead.  The  tendencies  that  Dos Passos observed sixty years ago have only become more pronounced. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Mass Transit</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In 1995, a million persons crossed borders somewhere in the world each day. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  represents  a  startling  change  from  the  past.  Before  the  twentieth century, travel was so infrequent that most borders were simply frontiers, not  barriers  to  transit.  Passports  were  unknown.  The  development  of ocean  liners,  trains,  and  other  improved  forms  of  transportation dramatically  increased  movement.  But  this  movement  became  more heavily  regulated  by  states  whose  powers  were  increased  by  the  same improvements  in  transportation  and  communications  that  made  civilian travel  cheaper  and  easier.  The  advent  of  movies  and,  especially, television also did a great deal to open horizons and stimulate travel and immigration.  Yet  until  now,  the  bedrock  assumptions  of  social  and economic organization have remained anchored in locality. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE ERROR OF MINIMAL EXPECTATIONS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The geographic tether on imagination is still so tight that some experts examining  the  Internet  in  1995  have  concluded  that  it  has  little commercial  potential  and  almost  no  significance  other  than  as  an electronic medium for chat and an outlet for pornography. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  many  doubters  of  the  economic  importance  of  cyberspace  are  the Colonel Blimps of the Information Age. Their complacency rivals that of the British establishment facing the decline of the empire in the 1930s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Whenever elites find themselves threatened, their first reaction is denial. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is evidenced by the fond hope that the Internet will never amount to much,  sometimes  endorsed  by  authorities  who  should  know  better.  We referred  earlier  to  David  Kline  and  Daniel  Burstein's  work,  <i class="calibre3">Road</i> <i class="calibre3">Warriors: Dreams and</i> <i class="calibre3">Nightmares Along the Information Highway. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Their dismissal of the economic potential of the Net is another proof that being  technically  well-informed  is  not  synonymous  with  understanding the  consequences  of  technology.7  Even  the  most  technically  expert observers in the past have frequently 147</p>

<p class="calibre1">failed  to  grasp  the  implications  of  new  technologies.  A  British parliamentary committee, convened in 1878 to consider the prospects for Thomas Edison's incandescent lamp, reported Edison's ideas to be "good enough for our transatlantic friends, . . . but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thomas  Edison  himself  was  a  man  of  great  vision,  but  he  thought  that the phonograph he invented would be employed mainly by businessmen for  dictation.  Only  a  short  time  before  the  Wright  brothers  proved  that airplanes  would  fly,  the  distinguished  American  astronomer  Simon Newcomb  authoritatively  demonstrated  why  heavier-than-air  flight  was impossible.  He  concluded:  "The  demonstration  that  no  possible combination  of  known  substances,  known  forms  of  machinery  and known  forms  of  force,  can  be  united  in  a  practical  machine  by  which men  shall  fly  long  distances  through  the  air,  seems  to  the  writer  as 236</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-238"></a>complete  as  it  is  possible  for  the  demonstration  of  any  physical  fact  to be."  Soon  after  airplanes  began  to  fly,  another  renowned  astronomer, William H. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pickering,  explained  to  the  public  why  commercial  travel  would  never get  off  the  ground:   <i class="calibre3">"The  popular  mind  often  pictures  gigantic  flying</i> <i class="calibre3">machines</i> <i class="calibre3">speeding  across  the  Atlantic  and  carrying  innumerable</i> <i class="calibre3">passengers  in  a</i> <i class="calibre3">way  analogous  to  our  modern  steamships.  .  .  .  [I]t  is</i> <i class="calibre3">clear  that  with  our</i> <i class="calibre3">present  devices  there  is  no  hope  of  competing  for</i> <i class="calibre3">racing speed with either</i> <i class="calibre3">our locomotives or our automobiles." </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  have  previously  recalled  another  wildly  inaccurate  prophecy  about the potential of a new technology-the forecast from the beginning of the twentieth century by the makers of Mercedes that there would never be more  than  a  million  automobiles  worldwide.  Again,  they  knew  more about  automobiles  than  almost  anyone  but  they  could  not  have  been more  wrong  in  estimating  the  impact  of  autos  on  society.  Given  this tradition of clueless misunderstandings, it is hardly surprising that many observers are slow to grasp the most important implications of the new information  technology-the  fact  that  it  transcends  the  tyranny  of  place. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  new  technology  creates  for  the  first  time  an  infinite,  nonterrestrial realm  for  economic  activity.  It  opens  an  option  to  explore  the  new frontiers of the cybereconomy, to "think globally and act globally." This chapter explains why. </p>

<p class="calibre1">237</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-239"></a><b class="calibre4">BEYOND LOCALITY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  processing  and  use  of  information  is  rapidly  replacing  and modifying physical products as the most important source of profit. This has major consequences. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  divorces  income-earning  potential  from residence in any specific geographic location. Since a greater and greater portion of the value of products and services will be created by adding ideas  and  knowledge  to  the  product,  an  ever-smaller  component  of value-added  will  be  subject  to  capture  within  local  jurisdictions.  Ideas can  be  formulated  anywhere  and  transmitted  globally  at  the  speed  of light.  This  inevitably  means  that  the  information  economy  will  be dramatically different from the economy of the Factory Age. We would concede  to  the  critics  that  a  recital  of  the  tasks  you  could  have undertaken through the Internet in 1996 might seem mundane. There is, after all, 148</p>

<p class="calibre1">nothing  terribly  revolutionary  about  reading  an  article  about  gardening on  the  Net,  or  buying  a  case  of  wine  long-distance.  However,  the potential  of  the  cybereconomy  cannot  be  judged  solely  on  its  early beginnings, any more than the potential of the automobile to transform society could have been judged by what you could have seen around you in 1900. We expect the cybereconomy to evolve through several stages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  most  primitive  manifestations  of  the  Information  Age  involve  the Net  simply  as  an  information  medium  to  facilitate  what  are  otherwise ordinary industrial-era transactions. At this point, the Net is no more than an exotic delivery system for catalogues. Virtual Vineyards, for example, one  of  the  first  cybermerchants,  simply  sells  wine  from  a  page  on  the World Wide Web. Such transactions are not yet directly subversive of the old institutions. They employ industrial currency, and take place within identifiable  jurisdictions.  These  uses  of  the  Internet  have  little  such megapolitical impact. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">238</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-240"></a>An  intermediate  stage  of  Internet  commerce  will  employ  information technology in ways that would have been impossible in the industrial era, such  as  in  long-distance  accounting  or  medical  diagnosis.  More examples  of  these  new  applications  of  advanced  computational  power are  spelled  out  below.  The  second  stage  of  Net  commerce  will  still function  within  the  old  institutional  framework,  employing  national currencies  and  submitting  to  the  jurisdiction  of  nationstates.  The merchants who employ the Net for sales will not yet employ it to bank their  profits,  only  to  earn  revenues.  These  profits  made  on  Internet transactions will still be subject to taxation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A more advanced stage will mark the transition to true cybercommerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not  only  will  transactions  occur  over  the  Net,  but  they  will  migrate outside  the  jurisdiction  of  nationstates.  Payment  will  be  rendered  in cybercurrency. Profits will be booked in cyberbanks. Investments will be made  in  cyberbrokerages.  Many  transactions  will  not  be  subject  to taxation.  At  this  stage,  cybercommerce  will  begin  to  have  significant megapolitical  consequences  of  the  kind  we  have  already  outlined.  The powers  of  governments  over  traditional  areas  of  the  economy  will  be transformed  by  the  new  logic  of  the  Net.  Extraterritorial  regulatory power  will  collapse.  Jurisdictions  will  devolve,  The  structure  of  firms will change, and so will the nature of work and employment, This outline of the stages of the Information Revolution is only the barest sketch of what could be the most far-reaching economic transformation event. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-241"></a><b class="calibre4">THE GLOBALIZATION OF COMMERCE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  most  current  jurisdictional  advantages  will  be eroded  rapidly  by  technology.  New  types  of  advantages  will  emerge. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Falling  communications  costs  have  already  reduced  the  need  for proximity  as  a  necessary  condition  of  doing  business.  In  1946,  it  was technically possible for an investor in London to place an order with a broker  in  New  York.  But  only  the  largest  and  most  compelling transaction  would  have  justified  doing  so:  a  three-minute  phone  call between  New  York  and  London  cost  $650.  Today,  it  costs  $0.91.  The price  of  an  intercontinental  phone  call  has  plunged  by  more  than  99</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent in half a century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">149</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Convergent Communication</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Soon, the difference between intercontinental chat and a local call may be minimal. So, too, may be the differences among your telephone, your computer,  and  your  television.  All  will  be  interactive  communications devices,  more  easily  distinguished  on  ergonomic  than  functional grounds. You will be able to hold a voice conversation over the Internet using microphones and speakers on your personal computer. Or watch a movie. You will be able to talk back to your television, and communicate vast  amounts  of  data  through  the  network  provided  by  the  television entertainment  media.  As  the  industrial-era  distinction  between  various forms of communication breaks down and costs plunge, more and more services  will  bill  you  by  time  of  use  rather  than  according  to  the destination  of  your  messages.  Conversation  or  data  transmission anywhere in the world will cost little more than a local call did in most jurisdictions in 1985. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Internet Unwired</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Low-orbit  satellites  and  other  approaches  to  wireless  technology  will transmit  feeds,  back  and  forth  directly  to  a  beeper  in  your  pocket,  a portable  computer,  or  a  workstation,  without  interfacing  with  a  local telephone operating or TV cable system at all. In short, the Internet will 240</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-242"></a>be  unwired.  The  first  steps  in  that  direction  are  bound  to  be  halting because  of  the  relatively  slow  speed  of  data  transmission  in  the  early wireless  media  and  the  difficulties  of  "hearing"  weak  signals  broadcast from  subscriber  devices,  some  of  which  will  be  mobile  and  battery-powered.  Nonetheless,  these  technical  problems  will  be  tackled  and solved. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Business Without Borders</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Continued  expansion  of  computational  power  will  lead  to  better compression  technology,  speeding  data  flow.  Widespread  adoption  of existing  public  key:private  key  encryption  algorithms  will  allow providers,  such  as  satellite  systems,  to  incorporate  the  billing  function into the service, lowering costs. Simultaneous with the service, vendors will be able to debit accounts loaded on personal computers in much the way  that  France  Telecom  debits  the  "smart  cards"  employed  in  Paris phone boxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Phone Becomes a Bank</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The difference is that in the near future, you will be able to earn credits to your account with all manner of transactions and carry your phone box with you. Your PC</p>

<p class="calibre1">By  the  turn  of  the  millennium,  you  will  be  able  to  transact  business almost anywhere north of Antarctica. Anywhere wired or digital cellular telephone is available. Anywhere interactive cable television systems are in use. </p>

<p class="calibre1">241</p>

<p class="calibre1">His  words  may  be  in  Chinese  but  you  will  hear  them  Transcending Locality  I  8  roughly  translated  into  English.  He  will  hear  your conversation  in  Chinese.  In  time,  the  capacity  to  employ  instantaneous translation  will  Significantly  increase  competition  in  regions  where obstacles of language and idiom have heretofore been significant. When that happens, it will matter little or not a all that the Chinese government may not wish the call to be placed. </p>

If you are interested in chess above all else, or are a  keen  ca  fancier,  you  will  be  able  to  program  your  evening  news broadcast to feature information important to you about cats or chess.

<p class="calibre1">In  short  order,  faster  than  many  experts  now  think  possible,  activities will migrate into the cybereconomy that combine technologies in novel ways to transcend the tyranny of place and the antiquated institutions of the industrial economy. One day soon, if you have a stomach ache, you will  be  able  to  consult  a  digital  doctor,  an  expert  system  with  an encyclopedic  knowledge  of  symptoms,  maladies,  and  antidotes.  It  will access  your  medical  history  in  encrypted  form,  ask  whether  your  pain happens  after  eating  or  before  meals.  Whether  it  is  sharp  or  dull, persistent or episodic. Whatever questions doctors ask, the digital doctor will ask. It may determine that you drink too much wine, or not enough. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  may  be  referred  to  a  cyberspecialist.  If  you  need  an  operation,  a cybersurgeon in Bermuda may perform the operation long-distance with the aid of specialized equipment that performs micro-incisions. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Life-and-Death Information Processing</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  may  sound  like  science  fiction.  But  many  of  the  components  of cybersurgery are already in place. Others will be functional by the time you  read  this  book.  General  Electric  has  introduced  a  new  magnetic resonance  treatment  machine  (MRT)  into  fifteen  hospitals  around  the world.  The  machine  is  expected  to  have  a  three-year  research-and-development  phase,  but  after  that  it  is  likely  to  spread  rapidly  and become a norm for many types of surgery. It is one example, but a good 245</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-247"></a>one, of the way in which technology is changing society. Most of us are familiar  with  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  machines,  in  which magnetic  resonance  techniques  are  used  to  provide  doctors  with  soft-tissue images for diagnostic purposes. They provide better images of soft tissues than X-rays or ultrasound, and have become an essential part of modern  diagnostic  techniques,  particularly  in  cancers.  They  have, however, two 153</p>

<p class="calibre1">significant limitations at present. The tube does not allow free access to the patient; the machines are of limited power. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Cybersurgery</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">General  Electric  has  redesigned  magnetic  resonance  machines  so  that they can be used for treatment as well as diagnosis. The power has been upped five times. The tube has, in effect, been cut in two, so the patient will  lie  between  two  doughnut-shaped  units,  rather  than  being  fully enclosed. Instead of taking an image and then performing surgery in the light of that image, the surgeon will be able to see what he is doing as he does  it.  MRT  will  be  combined  with  noninvasive,  or  less  invasive, surgery using microtechniques. Instead of having to make large incisions with  scalpels,  the  surgeon  will  make  micro  incisions  with  probes,  and will be able to see what the probes reveal as he operates. He will perform the surgery from the image rather than by looking directly into the body. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  principle,  the  probes  will  be  operable  from  a  distance.  They  will  be able  to  destroy  tumors  with  laser  or  cryogenic-heating  or  freezing-devices of great precision. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  permit  operations  that  are  now  impossible,  particularly  in neurosurgery, where tumors often lie very close to essential parts of the brain.  It  will  also  permit  repeated  operations,  when  the  trauma  of  the traditional  surgical  operation  cannot  be  repeated  without  unacceptable damage.  Some  researchers  believe  that  the  knife  for  soft-tissue  surgery may be looked back on as an obsolete relic by 2010. A lot of fear, and much  of  the  aftershock,  will  be  taken  out  of  surgery  if  that  is  true. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Obviously, this is very good news for the patient. Operations which now take hours to perform, and have to be followed by days or weeks in the hospital, will take only half an hour, and may not require hospitalization 246</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-248"></a>at all. Indeed, the surgeon and the patient may never even be in the same room. But what will this do to hospitals and surgeons? </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Fewer Microsurgeons Doing More</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">There  will  be  a  revolution  in  surgery.  In  training,  a  third  of  young surgeons  have  failed  to  acquire  the  skills  needed  for  microsurgery.  A third  are  just  able  to  do  it,  and  a  third  become  excellent.  Similar proportions are found in conversion courses for senior surgeons. Fewer surgeons will be able to carry out more operations in a shorter time. It is likely that health care insurers and individuals seeking surgery will insist on  outcome  statistics  for  each  surgeon,  which  will  vary  rather  widely. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Patients  will  want  to  go  to  surgeons  who  produce  the  best  results, particularly if their conditions are life-threatening. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In some cases, the best surgeons may operate long-distance. They may perform  the  whole  operation  from  another  jurisdiction  where  taxes  are lower and courts do not honor exorbitant malpractice claims. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Digital Lawyers</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">154</p>

<p class="calibre1">Before  agreeing  to  perform  an  operation,  the  skilled  surgeon  will probably  call  upon  a  digital  lawyer  to  draft  an  instant  contract  that specifies and limits liability based upon the size and characteristics of the tumor revealed in images displayed by the magnetic resonance machine. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Digital  lawyers  will  be  information-retrieval  systems  that  automate selection  of  contract  provisions,  employing  artificial  intelligence processes such as neural networks to customize private contracts to meet transnational legal conditions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Participants  in  most  high-value  or  important  transactions  will  not  only shop  for  suitable  partners  with  whom  to  conduct  a  business;  they  will also shop for a suitable domicile for their transactions. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Emergency Consultation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  continue  the  example  of  cybersurgery,  the  technology  of  the Information Age will place a premium on the highest skills in surgery, as 247</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-249"></a>it will in almost every endeavor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Patients  have  been  willing  to  pay  such  a  premium  for  as  long  as  there have been knives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But limits on information and the difficulty of shopping for surgeons in an  emergency  in  any  given  locale  made  the  market  for  surgery  a  very imperfect one. It will be less imperfect in the Information Age. A patient facing  the  need  for  an  operation  in  twenty-four  hours,  or  perhaps  even forty-five minutes, could deputize digital assistants to locate the top ten surgeons  worldwide  available  to  perform  such  a  task  remotely,  review their success rates in similar cases, and solicit offers for their particular case from corresponding digital servants. All of this could be canvassed in a matter of moments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As a consequence, the most-favored 10 percent of surgeons will have a far larger share in the global market for surgery. The MRT machine, plus microsurgery techniques, will raise the premium for their work. Surgeons with  less  skill  will  focus  on  residual  local  markets.  This  life-and-death example  helps  suggest  some  of  the  revolutionary  consequences  of  the liberation of economies from the tyranny of place. Someone may object that  General  Electric's  MRT  machine  was  not  meant  to  be  employed long-distance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Perhaps, but this misses the point. It or some equipment like it soon will be. When operations are better performed by surgeons watching a screen than  looking  at  the  patient  directly,  it  will  matter  less  than  we  now suppose  where  the  surgeon  and  his  screen  are  located.  Increasing numbers  of  services  are  destined  to  be  reconfigured  to  reflect  the  fact that  information  technology  allows  persons  anywhere  on  the  globe  to interact in even so delicate a matter as surgery. In activities that require less  precise  equipment,  and  involve  lower  risks  of  failure,  the cybereconomy will flourish even more rapidly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">155</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  almost  every  competitive  area,  including  most  of  the  world's multitrillion-dollar investment activity, the migration of transactions into cyberspace will be driven by an almost hydraulic pressure-the impetus to avoid  predatory  taxation,  including  the  tax  that  inflation  places  upon everyone who holds his wealth in a national currency. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Escaping the Protection Racket</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">You do not need to think long about the megapolitics of the Information Age to realize that predatory taxes and inflation of the kind imposed as a matter of right by the wealthiest industrial countries upon their citizens will be preposterously uncompetitive on the new frontier of cyberspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Soon after the turn of the millennium, anyone who pays income taxes at rates currently imposed will be doing 50 out of choice. As Frederic C. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane  pointed  out,  history  shows  that  on  'the  frontiers  and  on  the  high seas,  where  no  one  had  an  enduring  monopoly  in  the  use  of  violence, merchants  avoided  payment  of  exactions  which  were  so  high  that protection  could  be  obtained  more  cheaply  by  other  means."  The cybereconomy provides just such an alternative. No government will be able to monopolize it. And the information technologies comprised by it will  provide  cheaper  and  more  effective  protection  for  financial  assets than most governments ever had reason to provide. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Black Magic of Compound Interest</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Remember,  each  $5,000  of  annual  tax  payments  paid  over  forty  years slashes your net worth by $2.2 million, assuming you could realize just a 10 percent return on your capital. At a 20 percent return, the compound loss balloons to about $44 million. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  high-income  earners  in  a  high-tax  country,  the  cumulative  losses from  predatory  taxation  over  a  lifetime  are  staggering.  Most  will  lose more  than  they  ever  had.  This  sounds  impossible,  but  the  mathematics 249</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-251"></a>are clear. It is something that you can confirm for yourself with a pocket calculator.  The  top  1  percent  of  taxpayers  in  the  United  States  pay  an average of more than $125,000 in federal income taxes annually. For a fraction of that amount, $45,000 a year, one would be welcome to live under  a  private  tax  treaty  in  Switzerland,  and  enjoy  law  and  order provided by what is arguably the most honest police and judicial system in the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From this perspective, the additional $80,000 a year of income tax paid above that generous level might well be classified as tribute or plunder. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Forty-five thousand dollars is certainly a substantial payment toward the maintenance of law and order, considering that police protection is meant to be a public good. In theory, public goods can be extended to additional users at a marginal cost of zero. The Swiss are glad to have you pay a negotiated fixed tax of $45,000 (50,000 Swiss francs) per year because they  make  an  annual  profit  of  $45,000  on  every  millionaire  who  signs up. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Compared  to  the  Swiss  alternative,  the  lifetime  losses  from  paying federal  income  tax  at  U.S.  rates  would  be  $705  million  for  an  investor who  could  average  a  20  percent  rate  of  return.  But  remember,  that assumes an annual tax payment of $45,000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">156</p>

<p class="calibre1">Compared to a tax haven like Bermuda, where the income tax is zero, the lifetime  loss  for  paying  taxes  at  American  rates  would  be  about  $1.1</p>

<p class="calibre1">billion. You may object that an annual return of 20 percent is a high rate of return. No doubt you would be right. But given the startling growth in Asia in recent decades, many investors in the world have achieved that and better. The compound rate of return in Hong Kong real estate since 1950 has been more than 20 percent per annum. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  some  economies  that  are  less  widely  known  for  growth  have afforded easy opportunities for high profits. You could have pocketed an average  real  return  of  more  than  30  percent  annually  in  U.S.  dollar deposits  in  Paraguayan  banks  over  the  last  three  decades.  High Investment  returns  are  easier  to  realize  in  some  places  than  others,  but skilled  investors  can  certainly  achieve  profits  of  20  percent  or  more  in 250</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-252"></a>good years, even if they do not consistently match the performances of George Soros or Warren Buffet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  the  higher  the  rate  of  return  that  you  could  earn  on  your capital,  the  greater  the  opportunity  costs  that  predatory  income  and capital  gains  taxes  impose.  But  the  conclusion  that  the  loss  is  huge, indeed  greater  than  the  total  amount  of  wealth  that  you  may  ever accumulate, does not depend upon your being able to achieve outlandish rates of return. Some mutual funds operating in the United States have averaged  annual  gains  of  more  than  10  percent  for  more  than  half  a century. If you could do no better than that and you are among the top 1</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent  of  American  earners,  then  your  net  worth  is  reduced  by  more than $33 million just by the income tax you pay in excess of $45,000</p>

<p class="calibre1">annually. Compared to a jurisdiction without income tax, the loss is $55</p>

<p class="calibre1">million. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">$55 Rather Than $55 Million</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">If  the  profit-maximizing  assumptions  of  economists  are  correct,  as  we believe they generally are, one of the more certain predictions you could make is that most people would act to salvage $55 million if they could. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That  is  our  prediction.  When  the  black  magic  of  compound  interest becomes  more  clear  in  the  minds  of  successful  people  in  high-tax countries, they will begin to shop in earnest among jurisdictions, just as they now shop for automobiles or compare rates on insurance policies. If you doubt it, merely stop people at random on the streets of New York or Toronto and ask whether they would move to Bermuda for $55 million. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The question answers itself. The quandary it poses is reminiscent of that Mark Twain imagined in deciding whether he would prefer to spend the night  with  Lillian  Russell  stark  naked  or  General  Grant  in  full  dress uniform. He did not deliberate long. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Residents of mature welfare states, particularly the United States, may be slower  on  the  uptake,  but  only  because  they  are  not  yet  aware  of  the choice  they  face.  In  the  fullness  of  time,  they  will  be.  You  or  anyone motivated  by  the  desire  to  live  a  better  life  will  see  the  attraction  of 251</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-253"></a>reducing the losses you suffer from predatory taxation. You need merely lodge your transactions in cyberspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This will, of course, be illegal in many jurisdictions. But old laws seldom can  resist  new  technology.  In  the  1980s,  it  was  illegal  in  the  United States to send a fax message. The U.S. Post Office considered faxes to be first-class mail, over which the 157</p>

<p class="calibre1">U.S.  Post  Office  claimed  an  ancient  monopoly.  An  edict  to  that  effect was  issued  reiterating  the  requirement  that  all  fax  transmissions  be routed to the nearest post office for delivery with regular mail. Billions of  fax  messages  later,  it  is  unclear  whether  anyone  ever  complied  with that law. If so, compliance was fleeting. The advantages of operating in the emerging cybereconomy are even more compelling than sidestepping the post office in sending a fax. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Widespread  adoption  of  public-key/private-key  encryption  technologies will soon allow many economic activities to be completed anywhere you please. As James Bennet, technology editor of Strategic Investment, has written:  Enforcement  of  laws  and  particularly  tax  codes  has  become heavily  dependent  on  surveillance  of  communications  and  transactions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Once  the  next  logical  steps  have  been  taken,  and  offshore  banking locations  offer  the  services  of  communication  in  hard  RSA-encrypted electronic mail using account numbers derived from public-key systems, financial transactions will be almost impossible to monitor at the bank or in communications. Even if the tax authorities were to plant a mole in the offshore bank, or burglarize the bank records, they would not be able to identify depositors.' 2</p>

<p class="calibre1">To a degree that has never before been possible, individuals will be able to determine where to domicile their economic activities and how much income tax they prefer to pay. Many transactions in the Information Age will not need to be domiciled in any territorial sovereignty at all. Those that  do  will  increasingly  find  their  way  to  places  like  Bermuda,  the Cayman  Islands,  Uruguay,  or  similar  jurisdictions  that  do  not  impose income taxes or other costly transaction burdens on commerce. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">From Monopoly to Competition</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">252</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-254"></a>Governments  have  become  accustomed  to  imposing  "protection services"  that  are,  in  Frederic  C.  Lane's  words,  "of  poor  quality  and outrageously  overpriced."  This  habit  of  charging  far  more  than government's services are actually worth developed through centuries of monopoly. Taxes were ruthlessly raised on anyone who seemed capable of  paying-precisely  because  governments  had  a  monopoly  or  near-monopoly  on  coercion.  This  tradition  of  monopoly  will  clash  in  a profound  way  with  the  new  megapolitical  possibilities  of cybercommerce. Encryption will make it easy to protect transactions in cyberspace.  The  cost  of  an  effective  encryption  software  program,  like PGP, is less than the commission charged by a full-service broker on a trade of one hundred shares. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  it  will  render  almost  any  transaction  invisible  and  impervious  to governments and thieves for many years to come. The new technology of the Information Age will effectively protect cyberassets at a vanishingly small cost. For $55 rather than $55</p>

<p class="calibre1">million,  participants  in  the  cybereconomy  will  enjoy  better  actual protection of their assets than they enjoyed during the industrial era or at any previous time in history. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Easily  used  encryption  algorithms  and  the  capacity  to  shop  between terrestrial  domiciles  for  transactions  will  provide  effective  protection against the largest source of predation, nationstates themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">158</p>

<p class="calibre1">That  is  not  to  say  that  territorial  governments  will  be  entirely outmaneuvered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They will still be able to exploit vulnerabilities to personal harm in order to  extract  head  taxes,  or  perhaps  even  hold  wealthy  individuals  to outright  ransom.  They  will  also  be  able  to  enforce  collection  of consumption  taxes.  Yet  protection,  the  most  important  service governments  provide,  will  be  put  on  a  more  nearly  competitive  basis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Less  of  the  cost  that  productive  people  pay  for  protection  will  be available  to  be  seized  and  reallocated  by  political  authorities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technological innovations will place a large and growing portion of the 253</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-255"></a>world's  wealth  outside  the  reach  of  governments.  This  will  reduce  the risks of trade, sharply lowering, in historian Janet Abu-Lughod's words, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"the  proportion  of  all  costs"  that  otherwise  would  have  had  to  be</p>

<p class="calibre1">"allocated to transit duties, tribute, or simple extortion." </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  has  been  rare  in  history  to  find  governments  truly  constrained  by competition. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  few  times  when  something  remotely  like  this  has  happened, governments  were  weak  and  technologies  were  similar  between jurisdictions.  As  Lane  suggested,  the  principal  factor  affecting profitability  under  such  conditions  tends  to  be  the  difference  in protection Costs paid by different entrepreneurs. The medieval merchant who  had  to  pay  twenty  tolls  to  bring  his  goods  to  market  could  not compete  with  a  merchant  who  had  to  pay  only  four  tolls  to  deliver  the same  goods  to  the  customer.  Similar  conditions  are  destined  to  return with the Information Age. Profitability will once again be determined not so  much  by  technological  advantage  as  by  your  success  in  minimizing the costs you are forced to pay for protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  new  economic  dynamic  directly  contradicts  the  desire  of government left over from the industrial era to impose monopoly pricing for  its  protection  services.  But,  like  it  or  not,  the  old  system  will  be nonviable  in  the  new  competitive  environment  of  the  Information  Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Any government that insists upon lumbering its citizens with heavy taxes that  competitors  do  not  pay  will  merely  assure  that  profits  and  wealth gravitate  someplace  else.  Therefore,  the  failure  of  the  mature  welfare states  to  curtail  taxes  over  the  long  term  will  be  self-correcting. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  that  tax  too  much  will  simply  make  residence  anywhere within their power a bankrupting liability. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments will not only lose their power to tax many forms of income and capital; they are also destined to lose their power of compulsion over money.  In  the  past,  megapolitical  transitions  have  been  associated  with changes in the character of money. </p>

<p class="calibre1">(The introduction of coinage helped launch the five-hundred-year cycle of  expansion  in  the  ancient  economy  that  culminated  with  the  birth  of Christ and the lowest interest rates before the modern period. The advent of the Dark Ages coincided with virtual closure of the mints. </p>

<p class="calibre1">159</p>

<p class="calibre1">While  Roman  coinage  continued  to  circulate,  quantities  of  money dwindled  along  with  trade  in  a  self-reinforcing  downward  spiral.  (The feudal  revolution  coincided  with  a  reintroduction  of  money,  coinage, bills of exchange, and other devices for settling commercial transactions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  particular,  a  surge  in  European  silver  production  from  new  mines  at Rammelsberg, Germany, facilitated an increase in the circulation of coin that helped lubricate commerce.) The greatest revolution in money prior to the Information Age came with the advent of industrialism. The early-modern state consolidated its power in the Gunpowder Revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  its  control  increased,  the  state  asserted  its  power  over  money,  and came to rely heavily upon the signature technology of industrialism, the printing  press.  The  first  implement  of  mass  production,  the  printing press,  has  been  widely  used  by  governments  in  the  modern  period  to mass-produce  paper  money.  Paper  money  is  a  distinctly  industrial product.  It  would  have  been  impractical  before  the  printing  press  to duplicate  receipts  or  certificates  that  became  paper  currency.  Certainly, monks  in  the  scriptoria  would  not  have  spent  their  time  well  drawing fifty-pound notes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paper money also contributed significantly to the power of the state, not only by generating profits from depreciating the currency, but by giving the  state  leverage  over  who  could  accumulate  wealth.  As  Abu-Lughod put  it,  "when  paper  money  backed  by  the  state  become  the  approved 255</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-257"></a>currency,  the  chances  for  amassing  capital  in  opposition  to  or independent of the state machinery became difficult." 16</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-258"></a><b class="calibre4">CYBERCASH</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Now the advent of the Information Age implies another revolution in the character of money. As cybercommerce begins, it will lead inevitably to cybermoney. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This new form of money will reset the odds, reducing the capacity of the world's  nationstates  to  determine  who  becomes  a  Sovereign  Individual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  crucial  part  of  this  change  will  come  about  because  of  the  effect  of information  technology  in  liberating  the  holders  of  wealth  from expropriation  through  inflation.  Soon,  you  will  pay  for  almost  any transaction over the Net or World Wide Web at the same time you place it, using cybercash. This new digital form of money is destined to play a pivotal role in cybercommerce. It will consist of encrypted sequences of multihundred-digit  prime  numbers.  Unique,  anonymous,  and  verifiable, this  money  will  accommodate  the  largest  transactions.  It  will  also  be divisible  into  the  tiniest  fraction  of  value.  It  will  be  tradable  at  a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Dialing Without Dollars</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Inevitably, this new cybermoney will be denationalized. When Sovereign Individuals can deal across borders in a realm with no physical reality, they  will  no  longer  need  to  tolerate  the  long-rehearsed  practice  of governments degrading the value of their money through inflation. Why should they? Control over money will migrate from the halls of power to the global marketplace. Any individual or firm with access to 160</p>

<p class="calibre1">cyberspace will be able to easily shift out of any currency that appears in danger of depreciation Unlike today, there will be no necessity to deal in legal  tender.  Indeed,  if  transactions  spanning  the  globe  it  will  be  likely that at least one party to every transaction will find himself dealing in a currency that is not legal tender to him. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Disadvantages of Barter Reduced</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">You will be able to trade in any medium you wish in the cybereconomy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A. the late Nobel Prize-winning economist E A. Hayek argued, there is 257</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-259"></a>"no  clear  distinction  between  money  and  non-money."  He  wrote,  " </p>

<p class="calibre1">although we usually assume there is a sharp line of distinction between what is money and what is not-and the law generally tries to make such a distinction-so far as the causal effects of monetary events are concerned, there is no such clear difference. What we find is rather a continuum in which objects of various degrees of liquidity, or with values which can fluctuate independently of each other, shade into each other in the degree to which they function as money."17</p>

<p class="calibre1">Digital money on global computer networks will make every object on Hayek's  continuum  of  liquidity  more  liquid-except  government  paper. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One  consequence  will  be  that  barter  will  become  far  more  practical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Increasing  numbers  of  objects  and  services  will  be  offered  in  specific bids for other objects and services. These potential transactions will be widely advertised throughout the world on the Net, which will increase their liquidity by magnitudes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One of the principal drawbacks of barter has always been the difficulty of  matching  a  person  with  one  specific  demand  with  another  who  had exactly that on offer and was seeking to acquire for himself exactly what the first proposed to trade. Primitive barter stumbled over the daunting improbability of exactly matching two parties wishing to exchange in a local  market.  Cash  transcended  the  limitations  of  barter,  and  its advantages will continue to be compelling in most transactions. But vast increases in computational power and the globalization of commerce in cyberspace  also  reduce  the  drawbacks  of  barter.  The  odds  of  finding someone  with  exactly  reciprocal  desires  to  yours  increase  dramatically when you can sort instantly across the entire world rather than drawing on only those whom you might meet locally. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Not Subject to Counterfeiting</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">While  paper  money  will  no  doubt  remain  in  circulation  as  a  residual medium  of  exchange  for  the  poor  and  computer-illiterate,  money  for high-value transactions will be privatized. Cybermoney will no longer be denominated only in national units like the paper money of the industrial period. It probably will be defined in terms of grams or ounces of gold, as finely divisible as gold itself, Or it may be defined in terms of other real stores of value. </p>

<p class="calibre1">258</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-260"></a>Even  where  different  pricing  measures  are  used,  or  certain  transactions continue  to  be  denominated  in  national  currencies,  cybermoney  will serve the consumers far better than nationalized money ever did. Rapidly advancing computational capacity will 161</p>

<p class="calibre1">diminish the difficulties of adjusting prices to various media of exchange to  the  vanishing  point.  Each  transaction  will  involve  the  transfer  of encrypted multihundred-digit prime-number sequences. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike the paper-money receipts issued by governments during the gold-standard  era,  which  could  be  duplicated  at  will,  the  new  digital  gold standard or its barter equivalents will be almost impossible to counterfeit for the fundamental mathematical reason that it is all but impossible to unravel  the  product  of  multihundred-digit  prime  numbers.  All  receipts will be verifiably unique. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  names  of  traditional  currencies  like  the  "pound"  and  the  "peso" </p>

<p class="calibre1">reflect  the  fact  that  they  originated  as  measures  of  weight  of  specific quantities of precious metals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  pound  sterling  was  once  upon  a  time  a  pound  of  sterling  silver. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paper money in the West began as warehouse or safe-deposit receipts for quantities of precious metals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments issuing these receipts soon found that they could print far more  of  them  than  they  could  actually  redeem  from  their  supply  of bullion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  was  easy.  No  individual  holding  a  gold  or  silver  certificate  could distinguish  any  information  about  the  actual  supply  of  precious  metals from his receipt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Other  than  the  serial  numbers,  all  the  receipts  looked  alike,  a  fact  that appealed to counterfeiters as well as politicians and bankers seeking to profit  from  inflating  the  supply  of  money.  Cybermoney  will  be  all  but impossible to counterfeit in this way, officially or unofficially. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The verifiability of the digital receipts rules out this classic expedient for expropriating  wealth  through  inflation.  The  new  digital  money  of  the Information Age will return control over the medium of exchange to the 259</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-261"></a>owners of wealth, who wish to preserve it, rather than to nationstates that wish to spirit it away. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Transaction Cost of "Free" Currency</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Use of this new cybermoney will substantially free you from the power of the state. Earlier, we cited the dreary record of the world's nationstates in maintaining the value of their currencies over the past half century. No currency  has  suffered  a  smaller  loss  from  inflation  since  World  War  II than  the  German  mark.  Yet  even  so,  71  percent  of  its  value  vanished between January 1, 1949, and the end of June 1995. The world reserve currency during this period, the U.S. dollar, lost 84 percent of its value.'8</p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  measure  of  the  wealth  that  governments  expropriated  by exploiting their territorial monopolies on legal tender. Note that there is no intrinsic necessity that currency depreciate or that the nominal cost of living rise every year. To the contrary. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The technical challenge of maintaining the purchasing power of savings is trivial. You can see this merely by looking at the long-term purchasing power of gold. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Between  January  1,  1949,  and  the  end  of  June  1995,  while  the  best  of nationalized  currencies  lost  almost  three-quarters  of  its  value,  the purchasing  power  of  gold  actually  rose.  As  documented  by  Professor Roy W.

VON HAYEK</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Privatizing Money</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Friedrich von Hayek argued in 1976 that the use of competitive, private currencies  would  eradicate  inflation.20  Without  legal-tender requirements  forcing  acceptance  of  an  inflating  currency  within  a jurisdiction,  Hayek  argued,  market  competition  would  force  the  private issuers of currency to preserve the value of their exchange media. Any issuer of a private currency failing to maintain its value would soon lose its customers. The evolution of encrypted cybercash will bring Hayek's logic vividly to life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The theory of "free banking," as it is called, is not merely a hypothetical academic  speculation.  Private  competing  currencies  circulated  in Scotland  from  early  in  the  eighteenth  century  until  1844.  During  that period,  Scotland  had  no  central  bank.  There  were  few  regulations  or restrictions  on  entry  into  the  banking  business.  Private  banks  took deposits and issued their own private currencies backed by gold bullion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As Professor Lawrence White has documented, this system worked well. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  more  stable,  with  less  inflation  than  the  more  heavily  regulated and  politicized  system  of  banking  and  money  employed  in  England during the same period.2' </p>

<p class="calibre1">Michael  Prowse  of  the  Financial  Times  summarized  Scotland's  free-banking  experience:  "There  was  little  fraud.  There  was  no  evidence  of over-issue  of  notes.  Banks  did  not  typically  hold  either  excessive  or inadequate  reserves.  Bank  runs  were  rare  and  not  contagious.  The  free banks  commanded  the  respect  of  citizens  and  provided  a  sound foundation for economic growth that outpaced that in England for most of the period."22</p>

<p class="calibre1">What worked well under the technological conditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries will work even better with twenty-first-century technology. You will soon be able to deal in digital money from a private 261</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-263"></a>firm,  issued  much  as  American  Express  issues  traveler's  checks  as receipts for cash. An institution of greater repute than any government, such as a leading mining company or the Swiss Bank Corporation, could create encrypted receipts for quantities of gold or even for unique bars, identified  by  molecular  signatures  and  possibly  even  inscribed  with holograms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These receipts will then trade as money, with almost no possibility that they can be counterfeited or inflated. The new digital gold will overcome many of the practical 163</p>

<p class="calibre1">problems that inhibited direct use of gold as money in the past. It will no longer be Inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous to deal in large sums of gold. Digital receipts will not be too heavy to carry. Indeed, their only physical  existence  will  be  as  elaborate  patterns  of  computer  code.  Nor will it be difficult to divide digital receipts into units small enough to pay for even microvalue purchases. A wafer of physical gold tiny enough to pay for a chiclet would soon be lost or confused with one tiny enough to pay for two chiclets. But it will be as easy for the computer to distinguish these  demoninations  of  digital  money  as  if  they  were  the  size  of  a chipmunk and a rhinoceros. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  capacity  of  digital  money  to  deliver  micropayments  will  facilitate the emergence of new types of businesses that heretofore could not have existed,  specializing  in  organizing  the  distribution  of  low-value information.  The  vendors  of  this  information  will  now  be  compensated through direct-debit royalty schemes that overcome previously daunting transaction  costs.  When  the  cost  of  billing  exceeds  the  value  of  a transaction, it probably will not take place. Use of cybermoney facilitates very-low-cost  simultaneous  billing,  in  which  accounts  are  debited  with use. We cited such an example above in imagining that you might pay a royalty equivalent to one-third of a penny to Bill Gates, or whoever owns the virtual-reality rights to tour the Louvre. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Multiply  this  in  a  thousand  ways.  Virtual  reality  will  create  almost unlimited  licensing  opportunities  that  will  nevertheless  command  only microroyalty payments. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-265"></a><b class="calibre4">ERADICATING INFLATION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  possibilities  notwithstanding,  surely  the  most  momentous consequence  of  the  new  digital  money  will  be  the  end  of  inflation  and the  de-leverage  of  the  financial  system.  The  economic  implications  are profound. The rise of inflation in the twentieth century, as we argued in <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, was intimately connected with  the  balance  of  power  in  the  world.  Increasing  returns  to  violence dictated sharply higher military expenditures, which in turn required ever more aggressive efforts to expropriate wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments found that they could effectively impose an annual wealth tax  on  all  who  held  balances  in  their  national  currencies.  This  annual wealth tax on currency holders could also be seen as a transaction fee for allowing the users of currency to maintain their wealth in a convenient form provided by the issuers.* Thinking of inflation as a transaction fee for the convenience of holding currency may be unusual, but consider it closely. During the Industrial Age we became so accustomed to thinking of  the  provision  of  currency  as  a  service  for  which  one  does  not  pay directly, that it was easy to forget that the issuers of the dollars, pesos, pounds,  and  francs,  namely  governments.  did  require  that  we  pay,  and pay dearly-through inflation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The rate of this inflationary transaction fee on currency varied during the last  half  century  from  a  low  of  2.7  percent  annually  for  the  German mark,  to  rates  perilously  close  to  100  percent.  For  example,  between 1960 and 1991, when President Menem launched 164</p>

<p class="calibre1">Argentina's  currency-board  reform,  inflation  struck  seventeen  zeros  off successive versions of Argentine currency. If all the wealth of the world had  been  converted  into  Argentine  pesos  in  1960  and  buried,  it  would not have been worth the effort to spade it up by 1991. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Argentina's  example  is  a  leading  indicator  for  the  next  millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Currency will not be inflated because other nationstates will no longer be able to get away with it, just as Argentina no longer can. Inflation had another  lure  during  the  industrial  period  when  prices  and  wages  were downwardly  inflexible.  Modest  inflation  increased  output  by  reducing 264</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-266"></a>real wages and prices could be damaged by a credit contraction imported from  other  countries.  Private  money  will  not  be  inflatable  because  of competitive pressures. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The death of inflation will take away the disguised profits that inflation previously  conveyed  to  those  who  were  the  monopolistic  issuers  of currency. If all the disguised profits of issuing money were extinguished, a new method of payment would be needed to compensate the issuers of currency  directly.  Use  of  the  new  monetary  system  will  therefore probably  involve  a  more  explicit  transaction  cost,  perhaps  a  fee  on  the order of 1 percent per annum. This will be a small price to pay compared to  the  annual  inflationary  penalty  of  from  2.7  percent  to  99  percent imposed  by  nationstates.  All  the  more  so  because  there  is  a  likelihood that overall prices will decline in the future as monopolies are eroded and competition intensifies worldwide. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Contracting Leverage</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The emergence of digital money will not only defeat inflation once and for all; it will also contract leverage in the banking systems of the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  ability  of  people  everywhere  to  bypass  regulatory  authorities  and shift their funds directly through the Internet is an entirely unprecedented consequence of the globalization of markets. It will be beyond the power of  any  government  to  regulate.  When  governments  can  no  longer depreciate  currency  by  printing  money  or  defraud  savers  by  expanding credit  at  will  through  captive  banking  systems,  they  will  lose  a  major part of their indirect capacity to commandeer resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Higher Interest Rates</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  create  an  obvious  dilemma  for  most  Western  governments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  face  sharp  drops  in  revenue  from  taxation  and  the  virtual elimination of leverage in the monetary system. At the same time, they will  retain  the  unfunded  liabilities  and  inflated  expectations  for  social spending inherited from the industrial era. The result to be expected is an intense fiscal crisis with many unpleasant social side effects that we will consider  in  later  chapters.  The  economic  consequence  of  this  transition crisis  will  probably  include  a  one-time  spike  in  real  interest  rates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">265</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-267"></a>Debtors will be squeezed as long-term liabilities contracted under the old system are liquidated, and concessionary credits dry up. </p>

<p class="calibre1">165</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Altered by Competition</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  facing  serious  competition  to  their  currency  monopolies will  probably  seek  to  underprice  the  for-fee  cybercurrencies  by tightening credits and offering savers higher real yields on cash balances in national currencies. Some governments may even seek to remonetize gold  as  another  expedient  to  meet  competition  from  private  currencies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  may  well  reason  that  they  could  gain  higher  seigniorage  profits from  a  loosely  controlled  nineteenth-century  gold  standard  than  would be  the  case  if  they  allowed  their  national  currency  to  be  displaced entirely by commercial cybermoney. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But not all governments will respond in the same way. Those in regions where  computer  'usage  and  Net  participation  are  low  may  opt  for  old-fashioned  hyperinflation  in  the  early  stages  of  the  cybereconomy.  This will  not  enable  these  governments  to  capture  the  cash  balances  of  the rich, but it will wring resources from those with little wealth or access to the  cybereconomy.  Governments  using  such  tactics  might  nonetheless borrow internationally in cybermoney. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Still  other  governments  may  adapt  to  the  opportunities  created  by  the information  economy,  and  facilitate  local  transactions  in  cybermoney. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Those  jurisdictions  that  first  recognize  the  validity  of  digital  signatures and provide local court enforcement of repossession for nonpayment of cyberdebts  will  stand  to  benefit  from  a  disproportionate  surge  in  long-term capital lending. Obviously, no cybermoney would be available for long-term  credits  in  territories  where  local  courts  imposed  penalties  or permitted debtors to default without recourse. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Yield Gap</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  combination  of  credit  crises,  competitive  adjustments  by  national monetary  authorities,  and  early  transitional  obstacles  to  lending cybercurrency  will  lead  to  a  yield  gap  in  the  early  stages  of  the 266</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-268"></a>information  economy.  Cybermoney  will  pay  lower  interest  rates  than national  currencies  and  will  probably  also  carry  explicit  transaction costs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Offsetting  these  apparent  drawbacks  to  holding  balances  in  digital money will be enhanced protection against losses due to predatory taxes and inflation. Because it will probably be gold-linked, cybermoney will also benefit from the appreciation of gold. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  price  of  gold  will  probably  rise  significantly  relative  to  other commodities,  no  matter  which  of  the  alternative  government  policies predominates.  Why?  The  real  price  of  gold  almost  always  rises  in deflation. A deflation, after all, reflects a shortage of liquidity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Gold is the ultimate form of liquidity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Deflation of the Industrial Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Higher  real  rates  all  around  will  spur  liquidation  of  high-cost, unproductive  activities,  and  temporarily  reduce  consumption.  We explored the logic of the credit cycle and its unwinding in  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the</i> <i class="calibre3">Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, so we will not 166</p>

<p class="calibre1">rehearse  those  arguments  here.  Suffice  it  to  say  that  the  deflationary environment  may  drag  on  for  some  time,  with  more  adverse consequences  in  the  high-cost  industrial  economies  of  North  America and  Western  Europe  than  in  the  low-cost  economies  in  Asia  and  Latin America. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Lower Rates Long-Term</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">While the early consequences of the emergence of the cybereconomy are likely to include higher interest rates, the longer-term consequence will be just the opposite. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The after-tax returns to savers will sharply increase as resources escape the  grasp  of  governments.  Dramatic  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of resource  use,  and  the  liberation  of  capital  to  find  the  highest  returns globally,  should  rapidly  compensate  for  the  output  lost  early  in  the transition crisis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">267</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-269"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Investor Control over Capital</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Conventional  thinkers  reviewing  our  argument  at  this  point  would conclude  that  the  breakdown  of  income  redistribution  in  the  leading nationstates would doom the world to economic collapse. Do not believe it. We do not gainsay the fact that a transition crisis would be likely. But the  view  that  the  state  improves  the  functioning  of  the  economy  by massive  reallocation  of  resources  is  an  anachronism,  an  article  of  faith roughly  equivalent  to  the  widespread  superstitions  at  the  close  of  the Middle  Ages  that  fasting  and  flagellation  were  beneficial  for  a community. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  should  not  be  forgotten  that  governments  waste  resources  on  a  large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Wasting  resources  makes  you  poor.  A  dramatic  improvement  in  the efficiency  of  resource  use  will  arise  when  revenues  historically engrossed by governments come to be controlled instead by persons of genuine  talent.  Tens  of  billions,  then  ultimately  hundreds  of  billions  of dollars  will  be  controlled  by  hundreds  of  thousands,  then  millions  of Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  new  stewards  of  the  world's  wealth  are  likely  to  prove  far  abler than politicians in utilizing resources and deploying investment. For the first  time  in  history,  megapolitical  conditions  will  allow  the  ablest investors  and  entrepreneurs  rather  than  specialists  in  violence  ultimate control  over  capital.  It  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  the  rates  of return  on  this  dispersed,  market-driven  investment  could  be  double  or triple the meager returns from the politically driven budget allocations of the nationstate era. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was not uncommon in the final decades of the twentieth century to find examples  in  any  country  of  government  investment  that  were substantially negative. We cited official Russian statistics in the revised version  of   <i class="calibre3">The  Great  Reckoning</i>  from  November  1992,  suggesting  that the whole of Russia's economy was "worth just $30</p>

<p class="calibre1">billion,  less  than  a  third  of  the  value  of  its  raw-material  inputs.  By implication,  the  output  of  Russia's  economy  would  more  than  triple  in 268</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-270"></a>value  if  the  domestic  manufacturing  and  service  economy  were  shut down completely. Instead of contributing value, they subtract it." 23</p>

<p class="calibre1">167</p>

<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, the example of Russia after the collapse of Communism is an extreme one, but there is ample evidence that reducing state control of resources  tends  to  improve  economic  efficiency.  Growth  rates  cited  by the Economist suggest that economic liberty is strongly correlated with economic  growth,  with  the  most  rapid  rates  of  growth  in  the  freest countries. The cybereconomy of the Information Age will be more free than any other commercial realm in history. It is therefore reasonable to expect  that  the  cybereconomy  will  rapidly  become  the  most  important new  economy  of  the  new  millennium.  Its  success  will  attract  new participants from everywhere on the globe, in the same way that the wide use  of  fax  machines  made  telecopying  increasingly  attractive  for nonusers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  even  more  important,  freedom  from  predatory  violence  will  allow the cybereconomy to grow at far higher compound rates of growth than conventional  economies  dominated  by  nationstates.  That  is  perhaps  the most important point to be made in anticipating the economic impact of the  likely  collapse  of  monopoly  taxing  and  inflating  capacities  of government.  Setting  aside  transition  difficulties,  which  could  last  for decades,  the  long-term  prospects  for  the  global  economy  should  be highly bullish. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Whenever  circumstances  allow  people  to  reduce  protection  costs  and minimize  tribute  paid  to  those  who  control  organized  violence,  the economy  usually  grows  dramatically.  As  Lane  said,  "I  would  like  to suggest that the most weighty single factor in most periods of growth, if any  one  factor  has  been  most  important,  has  been  a  reduction  in  the proportion of resources devoted to war and police."24</p>

<p class="calibre1">There  could  be  great  efficiency  gains  arising  from  a  reduction  of  the resources devoted to predation and living off the spoils of predation. If the pricing of protection were placed on a competitive basis, with local monopolies  competing  for  customers  on  a  basis  of  price  and  quality, potentially huge gains to efficiency would be possible. The result to be 269</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-271"></a>expected  would  be  much  lower  rates  of  taxation  and  less  loss  of resources and effort in political activity, which would no longer pay its previously huge dividends. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Would  voters  willingly  forgo  political  windfalls  to  which  they  have become  accustomed?  That  is  an  issue  we  take  up  at  length  elsewhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  a  simple  answer  is  that  we  may  have  no  choice.  No  one  now demonstrates  against  rainy  weather,  or  draught,  however  economically damaging or unpleasant it may be. No one, however criminally inclined, holds a pauper to ransom demanding a huge payment on pain of death. If it becomes impossible for politicians to obtain resources to redistribute, the public may respond in a rational way and forget about politics, just as well-intentioned people ceased organizing marches of penitents when the Middle Ages came to an end. </p>

<p class="calibre1">GALATIANS 6:7</p>

<p class="calibre1">Great  changes  in  the  dominant  forms  of  production  or  defense  change the  structure  of  society,  and  the  proportion  of  wealth  and  power  of different groups. The Information Age means more than just a growing use  of  powerful  computers.  It  means  a  revolution  in  lifestyles, institutions, and the distribution of resources. Because the role of covert violence  in  controlling  resources  will  be  sharply  diminished,  a  new configuration of wealth will develop, without the coercive mediation by government  that  characterized  the  twentieth  century.  Because  location will  mean  much  less  in  the  Information  Society,  there  will  be  a diminished  role  in  the  future  for  all  organizations  that  operate  within rather  than  beyond  geographic  boundaries.  Politicians,  labor  unions, regulated  professions,  lobbyists,  and  governments  per  se  will  be  less important.  Because  favors  and  restraints  of  trade  wrested  from governments will be less valuable, fewer resources will be wasted either to promote or resist lobbying. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Those  who  have  employed  compulsion  and  local  advantage  to redistribute  income  are  destined  to  lose  much  of  their  power.  This  will alter the command of resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Privately  generated  wealth  that  heretofore  has  been  commandeered  by the nationstate will be retained instead by those who earn it. Increasing amounts  of  wealth  will  find  their  way  into  the  hands  of  the  ablest entrepreneurs and venture capitalists worldwide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Globalization,  along  with  other  characteristics  of  the  information economy,  will  tend  to  increase  the  income  earned  by  the  most  talented individuals  in  each  field.

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A MAGNITUDE BEYOND PARETO'S LAW</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Pareto's law says that 80 percent of the benefit will depend on or go to 20</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of those engaged. This may be approximately true, though, more strikingly,  1  percent  of  the  population  of  the  United  States  pays  28.7</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of the income tax, suggesting that as societies advance into the Information Age they will experience an even more skewed distribution of incomes and abilities than Vilfredo Pareto observed at the end of the last  century.  People  are  quite  accustomed  to  substantial  inequalities  of wealth. In 1828, 4</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of New Yorkers were thought to have owned 62 percent of all the city's wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">169</p>

<p class="calibre1">By 1845, the top 4 percent owned about 81 percent of all corporate and noncorporate wealth in New York City. More broadly, the top 10 percent of the population owned about 40 percent of the wealth across the whole United  States  in  1860.  By  1890,  records  suggest  that  the  richest  12</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent then owned about 86 percent of America's wealth.' </p>

<p class="calibre1">The 1890 numbers are close to what Pareto had in mind. They vary from his  ratio  of  80-20  percent  mainly  because  a  huge  influx  of  penniless immigrants arrived in America at the end of the nineteenth century. The immigrants' share of total wealth was negligible; therefore, their arrival automatically  made  the  total  holdings  of  wealth  more  unequal.  In  fact, this  is  a  striking  illustration  of  the  fact  that  any  genuine  upsurge  in opportunity is almost inevitably bound to lead to at least a brief surge in inequality.  By  1890,  immigrants  accounted  for  about  15  percent  of  the total  U.S.  population,  but  more  than  40  percent  in  some  of  the northeastern  states,  where  much  of  the  income  and  wealth  were generated.2  Adjusting  for  the  surge  in  immigration,  late-nineteenth-century  America  fit  Pareto's  formula  about  as  well  as  late-nineteenth-century Switzerland, where he lived. </p>

<p class="calibre1">272</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-274"></a>The  Information  Age  has  already  changed  the  distribution  of  wealth, particularly  in  the  United  States,  and  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  the bitterness of modern American politics, which we explore further in the next  chapter.  The  Information  Age  requires  a  quite  high  standard  of literacy and numeracy for economic success. A massive U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Education  Department  survey,  "Adult  Literacy  in  America,"  has  shown that  as  many  as  90  million  Americans  over  the  age  of  fifteen  are woefully  incompetent.  Or  in  the  more  colorful  characterization  of American  expatriate  Bill  Bryson,  "They  are  as  stupid  as  pig  dribble."3</p>

<p class="calibre1">Specifically,  90  million  American  adults  were  judged  incapable  of writing  a  letter,  fathoming  a  bus  schedule,  or  adding  and  subtracting, even with the help of a calculator. Those who cannot make sense of an ordinary  bus  timetable  are  unlikely  to  be  able  to  make  much  of  the Information Superhighway. From this third of Americans who have not prepared  themselves  to  join  the  electronic  information  world,  an  angry underclass  is  being  recruited.  At  the  top  of  society  is  a  small  group, perhaps  5  percent,  of  highly  educated  information  workers  or  capital owners who are the Information Age equivalent of the landed aristocracy of  the  feudal  age-with  the  crucial  difference  that  the  elite  of  the Information Age are specialists in production, not specialists in violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  no  very  good  reason,  most  twentiethcentury  sociologists  have assumed  that  technological  progress  would  naturally  tend  to  produce increasingly egalitarian societies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  was  not  true  prior  to  about  1750.  Beginning  around  that  time, innovative new industrial technology began to open job opportunities for the unskilled and increase the scale of enterprise. The new technology of the  factory  not  only  raised  the  real  earnings  of  the  poor  without  any effort  on  their  part;  it  also  tended  to  increase  the  power  of  political systems, making them more able to redistribute income as well as more capable of withstanding unrest. Taking a longer view, there is no inherent reason  to  suppose  that  technology  always  tends  to  mask  rather  than accentuate the differences in human talents 170</p>

<p class="calibre1">273</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-275"></a>and  motivation.  Some  technologies  have  been  relatively  egalitarian, requiring  contributions  of  many  independent  workers  of  approximately equal  utility;  others  have  put  power  or  wealth  into  the  hands  of  a  few masters while most people were little more than serfs. Both history and technology have shaped different nations in different ways. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Factory  Age  produced  one  shape,  and  the  Information  Age  is producing  another,  less  violent,  and  therefore  more  elitist  and  less egalitarian than the one it is replacing. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">AMMON'S TURNIP</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In the late nineteenth century a number of economists, of whom William Stanley Jevons was the most distinguished in England, started to develop mathematical economics. One of the first to apply probability theory to a major  social  question  was  the  German  economist  Otto  Ammon,  whose work was first translated into English by Carlos C. Closson in an article in  the  Journal  of  Political  Economy  in  1899.  The  article  was  entitled</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Some Social Applications of the Doctrine of Probability."4 One might suppose  that  such  an  article  was  now  of  purely  antiquarian  interest.  In fact, it deals with an economic problem that is again coming to the fore, and deals with it in what is still a stimulating way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Otto Ammon argued that this random distribution of throws of the dice was  matched  by  the  distribution  of  human  abilities.  He  was  writing before the development of intelligence testing and IQs, and relied on the earlier work on intelligence of Francis Galton. Ammon did not consider that social utility, or success in life, depended simply on intelligence. He listed  "three  groups  of  mental  traits  which  are  largely  decisive  in  the place which a man will occupy in life." These were: 1 . </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Intellectual traits</i>; among which I included all that belong to the rational side  of  manpower  of  quick  comprehension,  memory,  power  of judgement, power of invention, and whatever also belongs to this field. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2 . </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Moral  traits</i>;  namely,  self  control,  will  power,  industry,  perseverance, moderation, regard for family obligations, honesty and the like. </p>

<p class="calibre1">274</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-276"></a>3 . </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Economic  traits</i>;  such  as  business  ability,  organizing  talent,  technical skill, caution, clever calculation, foresight, thrift and so on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To these mental traits he added:</p>

<p class="calibre1">4 . </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Bodily traits</i>; power to work, endurance, power of undergoing exertions and of resisting excitements of every kind, vigour, good health,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  Otto  Ammon  's  view,  the  probable  distribution  of  these  qualities  of intelligence,  character,  talent,  and  body  were  similar  to  those  of  scores on  the  dice.  He  went  further  and  argued  that  there  were,  in  fact,  many more than four variables, and that they varied in more than six degrees. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If instead of throwing four dice, one throws eight, then there are no less than  1,679,616  possible  throws,  yet  the  highest  score,  forty-eight,  can still only be expected to occur once. The man or woman who scores very highly in all the factors that determine the place in life is much rarer than the probability of 171</p>

<p class="calibre1">throwing  four  sixes  would  suggest;  perhaps  as  rare  as  throwing  eight sixes.  Yet,  Ammon  notes,  a  mixture  of  high  and  low  scores  in  these human  qualities  may  produce  "persons  of  unbalanced,  inharmonious gifts, who, in spite of some brilliant qualities, cannot successfully meet the tests of life." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Like a lonely mountain peak, or rather like the spire of a cathedral, rise</i> <i class="calibre3">the  men  of  high  talent</i> <i class="calibre3">and  of  genius  above  the  broad  mass  of</i> <i class="calibre3">mediocrity… The number of the highly gifted is at all</i> <i class="calibre3">events so small that</i> <i class="calibre3">it  is  impossible  that  'many'  such  can  have  been  kept  back  in  lower</i> <i class="calibre3">classes</i> <i class="calibre3">through  the  incompleteness  of  social  institutions." </i> OTTO</p>

<p class="calibre1">AMMON</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Traits and Incomes</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Ammon then turns to the distribution of incomes. Of course, the statistics of  the  1890s  were  much  less  adequate  than  they  would  be  now,  but German  bureaucracy  was  already  well  developed,  and  Otto  Ammon 275</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-277"></a>found in Saxony, Prussia, Baden, and other German states income curves that he thought were similar, both to his perceived distribution of human ability  and  to  the  probabilities  of  the  dice.  He  found  similar  figures  in Charles  Booth's  Life  and  Labour  of  the  People  of  London  (1892). </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, Booth's social distribution does look much as one might expect from Ammon's probability theory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Booth found in London 25 percent who were poor or worse, 51.5 percent who were comfortable, and 15 percent who were well-to-do, or better; if one takes the two lowest of Booth's categories they come to 9.5 percent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  common  before  the  welfare  states  of  the  twentieth  century  to speak of those who were least well off as the "submerged tenth." </p>

<p class="calibre1">5 The two highest of Booth's categories come to 7 percent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From all this, Otto Ammon drew a number of interesting conclusions. He thought that people's abilities, broadly defined, determined their place in society and their income. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He believed that high abilities naturally result in people rising in income and  social  position.  "Like  a  lonely  mountain  peak,  or  rather,  'like  the spire of a cathedral, rise the men of high talent and of genius above the broad mass of mediocrity…’ He also believed that the 'true form of the so-called social pyramid is that of a somewhat flat onion or turnip." This turnip has a narrow stem above and a narrow root beneath. Such a social turnip  is  preferable  as  a  metaphor  to  the  social  pyramid  because,  like modern industrial society, it has its mass in the middle while the pyramid has its mass at the bottom. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Shape of the Turnip</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Modern industrial societies are indeed all turnips, with a small wealthy and  upper-professional  class  at  the  top,  a  larger  middle  class,  and  a minority  poor  class  at  the  bottom.  Relative  to  the  middle,  both  the extremes  are  small.  In  modern  London,  if  not  in  Washington,  there  are certainly more millionaires than homeless. </p>

<p class="calibre1">All of this is intriguing, but the immediate interest of Ammon's work lies in  the  major  long-term  shift  we  are  experiencing  in  the  relations, 276</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-278"></a>financial and political, between the top and the middle. The skills needed in the Factory Age, which is now passing, are undeniably different from those demanded by the Information Age. Most 172</p>

<p class="calibre1">people could master the skills required for operating the machines of the mid-twentieth century, but those jobs have now been replaced by smart machines which, in effect, control themselves. A whole arena of low-and middle-skill employment has already disappeared. If we are correct, this is  a  prelude  to  the  disappearance  of  most  employment  and  the reconfiguration of work in the spot market. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre3">Yet  it  is  a  ,fact  acknowledged  officially  but  quietly,  that  most  of  the</i> <i class="calibre3">unemployed</i> <i class="calibre3">youngsters  have  no  qualifications  whatsoever..." </i> 6  CLIVE</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">FEWER PEOPLE WILL DO MORE WORK</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  can  take  the  simple  four-dice  distribution  of  human  ability  and suppose that people could score in the Factory Age with a set of 4 x 2 or above.  That  would  mean  that  over  95  percent  of  the  population  were above  what  Charles  Booth  called  "the  lowest  limit  of  positive  social usefulness." Indeed 3 percent was set as the full-employment standard of the 1940's and 1950's. Suppose that in the Information Age the required score has risen to a 4 X 3, and the required minimum has gone up from 8</p>

<p class="calibre1">to 12. That would mean that nearly 24 percent would fall below this limit of "social usefulness." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Something  similar  would  happen  at  the  top  end  of  the  scale.  In  the Factory  Age,  the  required  level  of  high  ability  was  perhaps  4  x  4; suppose that in the Information Age it has risen to 4 X 5. In that case the proportion  of  people  qualified  for  the  top  jobs,  which  are  also  the  best paid, would fall from 34 percent to 5 percent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These numbers are purely hypothetical. Obviously, we do not know what the  shift  in  the  skill  requirements  will  be-or  has  already  been-but  there has  certainly  been  a  rise.  Because  of  the  shape  of  the  turnip,  a  quite modest rise in the minimum skill requirement would put large numbers outside of a significant economic role. Equally, quite a small rise in the higher skill requirement would reduce the number of people qualified for the higher jobs very dramatically. Some shift is happening: we do not yet know how big it will be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There is indeed no lack of social and political evidence that this shift is taking  place  in  all  advanced  industrial  societies,  that  its  pace  is accelerating, and that the movement is already a big one. The rewards for rare  skills  have  increased  and  are  increasing.  This  has  been  noted  with displeasure  by  conventional  thinkers.  Consider,  for  example,  The Winner-Take-All  Society,  by  Robert  H.  Frank  and  Philip  J.  Cook.7  It documents  the  growing  tendency  for  the  most  talented  competitors  in many fields in the United States to earn very high incomes. Equally, the opportunities  for  middle  skills  are  falling;  a  substantial  number  of  low 278</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-280"></a>skills  now  fall  outside  the  range  that  is  rewarded  with  a  comfortable living, though they may still find a place in small-scale services. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If the Information Age demands higher skills both at the top and bottom end,  everyone  except  for  the  top  5  percent  will  be  relatively  at  a disadvantage, but the top 5</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent  will  gain  tremendously.  They  will  both  earn  a  higher  share  of income  and  keep  a  greater  share  of  what  they  earn.  At  the  same  time, they will do a greater portion of the world's work than ever before. Many will emerge as Sovereign Individuals. In the 173</p>

<p class="calibre1">Information Age, the turnip of income distribution will look more as it did in 1750 than in 1950. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Societies  that  have  been  indoctrinated  to  expect  income  equality  and high levels of consumption for persons of low or modest skills will face demotivation and insecurity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the economies of more countries more deeply assimilate information technology,  they  will  see  the  emergence-so  evident  already  in  North America-of a more or less unemployable underclass. This is exactly what is  happening.  This  will  lead  to  a  reaction  with  a  nationalist, antitechnology bias, as we detail in the next chapter. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Factory  Age  may  prove  to  have  been  a  unique  period  in  which semistupid machines left a highly profitable niche for unskilled people. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now that the machines can look after themselves, the Information Age is pouring  its  gifts  onto  the  top  5  percent  of  Otto  Ammon's  turnip.  The Information Age was already looking far better for the top 10</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent, the so-called cognitive elite. Yet it will be the best of all for the top  10  percent  of  the  top  10  percent,  the  cognitive  double  top.  In  the feudal  age,  it  took  one  hundred  semiskilled  peasants  to  support  one highly  skilled  warlord  (or  knight)  on  horseback.  The  Sovereign Individuals of the information economy will not be warlords but masters of specialized skills, including entrepreneurship and investment. Yet the feudal hundred-to-one ratio seems set to return. For better or worse, the 279</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-281"></a>societies  of  the  twenty-first  century  are  likely  to  be  more  unequal  than those we have lived in during the twentieth. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">MOST PEOPLE WILL GAIN FROM THE DEATH OF POLITICS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">It is unlikely that the egalitarian economy and the nations it supports can disappear without a crisis. While a crisis by definition can last only for a short while, we nonetheless imagine that the trauma of the end of nations could reverberate for years. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Without  ignoring  that  trauma,  whose  dimensions  we  explore  in  greater detail later, it is important not to forget that in many areas of the globe the transition to the information economy will lead output to surge, with higher incomes all around. Indeed, in those areas that never shared fully in  the  benefits  of  industrialism  but  are  now  open  to  the  free  market, incomes are rising or will rise among all classes of people. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  deflation  of  compulsion  as  a  feature  of  economic  life  will  allow producers  to  retain  assets  that  heretofore  have  been  seized  and redistributed.  Redistribution  usually  meant  that  assets  were  dragooned into  lower-value  uses,  thus  reducing  the  productivity  of  capital.  Wealth taken disproportionately from persons who were most adept at investing resources was reallocated by politicians to those who were less adept. In most cases, redistributed income was employed in lower-order economic activities.  The  effects  of  freeing  resources  from  systematic  compulsion will  vary  greatly  among  jurisdictions.  This  freezing  of  resources  will bankrupt  welfare  states,  and  enhance  diseconomies  to  scale  that  are undermining  large  governments  and  all  institutions  subsidized  by  large governments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">On  the  other  hand,  the  shift  to  the  cybereconomy  will  reduce  the economic drawbacks suffered by people operating under sovereignties in regions that have traditionally suffered from the inability to organize on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because there will no longer be rising returns to violence, there will be no  advantage  to  living  under  a  government  that  could  capture  them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Once-competent  governments  will  no  longer  be  the  friends  of  wealth accumulation, but their enemies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">High taxes, burdensome regulatory costs, and ambitious commitments to income redistribution will make territories under their control uninviting settings in which to do business. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Those  who  live  in  jurisdictions  that  remained  poor  or  underdeveloped during  the  industrial  period  have  the  most  to  gain  by  the  liberation  of economies from the confines of geography. This is contrary to what you will  hear.  The  main  controversy  surrounding  the  advent  of  the information economy and the rise of the Sovereign Individual will focus on the allegedly adverse effects on "fairness" arising from the death of politics.  It  is  certainly  true  that  the  advent  of  the  global  information economy  will  deal  a  mortal  blow  to  large-scale  income  redistribution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  main  beneficiaries  of  income  redistribution  in  the  Industrial  Age have  been  inhabitants  of  wealthy  jurisdictions  whose  level  of consumption is twenty times higher than the world average. Only within the OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">countries  has  income  redistribution  had  noticeable  effects  in  raising incomes of unskilled persons. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  greatest  income  inequalities  have  been  observed  among jurisdictions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Income redistribution has done little to alievate them. In fact, we believe that  foreign  aid  and  international  development  programs  have  had  the perverse  effect  of  lowering  the  real  incomes  of  poor  people  in  poor countries  by  subsidizing  incompetent  governments.  This  is  an  issue  we consider  in  more  depth  in  analyzing  the  impact  of  the  Information Revolution on morality. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A Century of Rising Income Inequality</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">282</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-284"></a>During  the  industrial  period,  the  factor  that  contributed  most  to determining  the  ordinary  person's  lifetime  income  was  the  political jurisdiction  in  which  he  happened  to  reside.  Contrary  to  the  common impression  in  rich  economies  today,  income  inequality  rose  rapidly during  the  industrial  period.  An  estimate  cited  by  the  World  Bank suggests that average per capita income in the richest countries ballooned from eleven times that in the poorest countries in 1870 to fifty-two times in  l985.  While  inequality  increased  dramatically  on  a  global  basis,  it often  appeared  otherwise  to  the  fraction  of  the  world  inhabiting  the wealthy industrial countries. Income inequality rose among jurisdictions rather than within them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  have  already  explored,  the  character  of  industrial technology  itself  helped  assure  that  income  gaps  would  narrow  within jurisdictions where halfway 175</p>

<p class="calibre1">competent governments mastered the exercise of power on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When returns to violence were rising, as they were during the Industrial Age, governments that operated on a large scale tended to be controlled by  their  employees.  This  made  it  effectively  impossible  to  impose controls on the claims these governments made over resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their unchecked control over resources conveyed an important military advantage  so  long  as  magnitude  of  power  predominated  over  the efficiency  with  which  it  was  used.  A  not-incidental  corollary  of government  controlled  by  its  employees  was  a  sharp  acceleration  of income  redistribution.  Almost  every  society  has  some  provision  for income  redistribution,  at  least  on  a  temporary  basis  in  extraordinary circumstances. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However,  a  close  reading  of  the  history  of  the  provision  of  aid  to  the poor  shows  that  "welfare"  benefits  tend  to  be  more  generous  when poverty is minimal. Income redistribution is more likely to be curtailed when incomes for large numbers weaken. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Conditions  in  the  wealthy  industrial  societies  in  the  last  half  of  the twentieth century were almost perfect for redistributing income. This led to  much  higher  rewards  for  unskilled  work  within  these  favored 283</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-285"></a>jurisdictions. In due course, it even provided high levels of consumption for those who did not work at all. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Paradox of Industrial Wealth</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  irony  is  that  it  was  also  in  these  jurisdictions  that  more  people became  wealthy.  This  apparent  paradox  makes  perfect  sense  once  you understand the dynamics of megapolitics explored in previous chapters. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Leading  sectors  of  the  industrial  economy  required  the  maintenance  of order on a large scale to function optimally. This made them particularly vulnerable  to  extortion  by  unions  and  governments  eager  to  maximize the number of persons under their sway. Yet widespread redistribution of income  did  not  totally  stifle  the  ability  of  the  industrial  economy  to function. Anyone lucky enough to be born in Western Europe, the former British  settlement  colonies,  or  Japan  during  the  high-water  period  of industrialism  was  therefore  likely  to  be  far  richer  than  a  person  of equivalent  skills  in  South  America,  Eastern  Europe,  the  late  Soviet Union,  Africa,  and  the  landmass  of  Asia.  The  beneficial  impact  of information  technology  will  include  helping  to  overcome  many  of  the obstacles  to  development  that  prevented  the  majority  of  the  world's population  from  enjoying  many  of  the  benefits  of  free  markets  during much of the modern period. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">DISECONOMIES OF SCALE AND RETARDED GROWTH</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Mancur  Olson  has  demonstrated,  backwardness  in  the  twentieth century  was  not  due  to  lack  of  capital  or  specialized  skills  per  se.  In</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Diseconomies of Scale and Development," an essay published in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, 176</p>

<p class="calibre1">Olson  wrote,  "If  capital  had  in  fact  been  in  scarce  supply  in  the  poor countries,  its  'marginal  productivity'  and  so  the  profitability  of  its  use ought  to  be  greater  than  in  the  prosperous  countries.  The  low  growth rates  of  many  countries  that  received  nonnegligible  amounts  of  foreign 284</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-286"></a>aid and the low productivity of some modern factories that were built in poor  countries  have  further  lessened  the  credibility  of  the  'scarcity  of capital'  explanation  of  underdevelopment."  This  must  be  right.  Had capital or skill scarcity been the main deficiency, the returns earned by both  in  poor  jurisdictions  would  have  been  higher  than  in  developed countries.  Both  skilled  personnel  and  capital  would  have  flooded  into these regions until the returns leveled out. In fact, the opposite was often the case. There was a substantial outmigration of educated people from backward  jurisdictions.  And  the  lucky  few  who  did  manage  to accumulate  capital  in  such  places  exported  it  as  rapidly  as  possible  to Switzerland and other advanced countries. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Better Government Could Not Be Imported</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Olson  argues,  and  we  agree,  that  the  true  obstacle  to  development  in backward countries has been the one factor of production that could not be easily borrowed or imported from abroad, namely government. This is a  problem  that  worsened  as  the  twentieth  century  unfolded.  In  1900, Great  Britain  and  France,  along  with  some  other  European  countries, were  in  the  business  of  exporting  competent  government  to  regions where indigenous powers were incapable of functioning effectively on a large scale. But shifting megapolitical conditions in the twentieth century raised the costs and lowered the returns for this activity. Colonialism, or imperialism,  as  it  was  less  fondly  known,  ceased  to  be  a  paying proposition.  Shifts  in  technology  raised  the  costs  of  projecting  power from  the  center  to  the  periphery  and  lowered  the  military  costs  of  an effective resistance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Consequently,  imperial  powers  withdrew,  or  stayed  on  only  in  tiny enclaves, like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. </p>

In many cases, especially in Africa, infrastructure inherited  from  the  departing  colonial  powers  was  rapidly  looted, destroyed,  or  allowed  to  fall  into  disrepair.  Telephone  lines  were  torn down by scavengers and hammered into bracelets. Roads were no longer maintained. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rail lines became useless as roadbeds fell apart and locomotives broke down. In Zaire, the elaborate transportation infrastructure installed by the Belgians had almost totally 177</p>

<p class="calibre1">disappeared  by  1990.  Only  a  few  creaky  riverboats  continued  to function, one of which was taken over as a kind of floating palace by the dictator. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Undependable communication and transport reflect the incompetence of backward nationstates at maintaining order. They have kept prices high and  minimized  opportunities  for  most  of  the  world's  population.  As Olson emphasizes: First, poor transportation and communication tend to force a firm to rely mainly on local factors of production. When a firm's scale  increases,  it  will  have  to  go  further  afield  to  obtain  factors  of production,  and  the  poorer  the  transportation  and  communications systems the faster these factor costs will rise with expanding output. The second  and  more  important  reason  why  poor  transportation  and communication systems work</p>

<p class="calibre1">against  effective  large-scale  enterprises  is  that  they  make  it  far  more difficult to coordinate such enterprises effectively." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Lightening the Burden of Bad Government</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The ambitious poor of the world, more than anyone, stand to benefit as information technology disconnects the capacity to earn income from the locale in which one lives. New technologies, such as the digital cellular 286</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-288"></a>telephone, allow communications to function independently of the ability of the local police to defend every telephone pole in a jurisdiction from copper  thieves.  As  wireless  fax  and  Internet  connections  become available, it no longer matters so much whether desperately poor postal employees will pilfer mail just to steal the stamp. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In many cases, effective communications are even replacing the need for the physical transport of goods and services. Better communications and vastly  increased  computational  power  not  only  make  coordination  of complex  activities  cheaper  and  more  effective;  they  also  lower  scale economies  and  dissolve  large  organizations.  These  changes  all  tend  to reduce the penalty that persons in backward countries have suffered for living under incompetent governments. The Information Revolution will make  it  much  less  important  whether  governments  are  able  to  function capably. It will therefore be easier for persons living in traditionally poor countries to surmount the hurdles that their governments have heretofore placed in the path of economic growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Equal Opportunity in the Information Age</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  familiar  locational  advantages  will  rapidly  be transformed  by  technology.  Earnings  capacity  for  persons  of  similar skills will become much more equal, no matter in what jurisdiction they live. This has already begun to happen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because institutions that have employed compulsion and local advantage to  redistribute  income  are  losing  power,  income  inequality  within jurisdictions will rise. Global competition will also tend to increase the income earned by the most talented individuals 178</p>

<p class="calibre1">in  each  field,  wherever  they  live,  much  as  it  does  now  in  professional athletics.  The  marginal  value  generated  by  superior  performance  in  a global market will be huge. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While  public  debate  will  focus  on  growing  'inequality"  in  the  OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">countries,  individuals  everywhere  will  enjoy  far  more  nearly  equal opportunity.  They  will  no  longer  need  to  live  in  a  jurisdiction  that functions well on a large scale in order to succeed. Innate abilities and the  willingness  to  develop  them  will  be  measured  on  a  more  equal 287</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-289"></a>playing  field  than  ever  before.  Jurisdictional  advantages  that  led  to widening  inequality  between  rich  and  poor  economies  during  the industrial period will change dramatically. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Higher Returns in Poor Areas</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  obstacles  that  governments  in  poorer  regions  place  in  the  way  of functioning free markets will be much diminished as the cybereconomy comes on line. As a consequence, capital and skills in short supply will in  fact  earn  higher  returns  in  many  currently  poor  areas,  much  as  the development  theorists  of  the  1950s  postulated  they  should.  And  both capital  and  skills  will  be  far  more  readily  importable.  Emerging economies will no longer need to rely as much as during the Industrial Age  upon  local  factors  of  production.  Their  enhanced  ability  to  draw upon  capital  and  expertise  at  a  distance  will  lead  to  higher  rates  of growth.  This  will  happen  whether  or  not  Incompetent  governments become  more  honest  or  better  able  to  protect  property  rights.  Lacking power over cyberspace, bad governments will simply be less able to stop people in their jurisdictions from benefiting from economic freedom. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Positive Reinforcement</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  cybereconomy,  the  almost  total  portability  of  information technology  will  prohibit  the  hoarding  of  many  of  the  jurisdictional advantages  that  arose  in  the  Industrial  Age.  Enhanced  competition between  increasing  numbers  of  jurisdictions  will  turn  on  new  types  of local  advantage.  Sovereignty  will  be  commercialized  rather  than predatory.  Governments  will  be  obliged  by  the  force  of  competition  to set policies to appeal to those of their customers who make the greatest contributions to economic wellbeing, not to those who contribute little or whose economic contributions are negative. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  represent  a  tremendous  change  from  the  common  practice  of the  twentieth  century.  The  ideology  of  the  nationstate  was  that  life  can and  should  be  regulated  in  a  positive  way  by  subsidizing  undesirable outcomes  and  penalizing  desirable  ones.  To  be  poor  is  undesirable; therefore,  the  poor  were  subsidized.  To  become  rich  is  desirable; therefore, punitive taxes were laid on the rich to make life more "fair." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  this  whole  policy  approach  was  rooted  in  a  megapolitical 288</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-290"></a>foundation that withstood all appeal, it mattered little what the perverse consequences of subsidizing dysfunction were. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor was there much accounting for the skill, hard work, or ingenuity that went  into  earning  the  wealth  that  was  redistributed.  Outcomes  were measured in terms of 179</p>

<p class="calibre1">entitlements.  The  twentiethcentury  political  view  assumed  that  in  order for outcomes to be "fair" they had to be equal. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The New Paradigm</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The new megapolitical conditions of the twenty-first century will allow market  tests  to  regulate  outcomes  in  areas  formerly  dominated  by politics.  The  market  paradigm  presupposes  that  results  can  be  better regulated  by  rewarding  desirable  outcomes  and  penalizing  undesirable ones. To be poor is undesirable, and to become rich is desirable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  incentives  should  reward  wealth  creation  and  encourage people to pay for the resources they consume. Life is more "fair" when people get to keep more of what they earn. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is a view that will be heard more frequently in the new millennium than it was in the century now ending. Furthermore, it will be compelling as never before because it will be megapolitically founded. Capital in the Information Age is growing more mobile by the moment. The capacity to earn high income is no longer tied to residence in specific locations, as was  the  case  when  most  wealth  was  created  by  manipulating  natural resources. With every day that passes, it becomes easier for people using highly portable information technology to create assets that are far less subject to the leverage of violence than any form of wealth has ever been before. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Arbitrary  political  regulations  that  impose  costs  without  creating offsetting market benefits will soon be nonviable. Powerful competitive forces  are  tending  to  equalize  the  prices  of  goods,  services,  labor,  and capital across the globe. Governments will have less latitude to impose arbitrary  policies  than  they  are  accustomed  to  enjoy.  Any  government that attempts to impose more burdensome regulations on an activity than 289</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-291"></a>other sovereignties will simply drive that activity away. In some cases, of course,  driving  away  unwanted  activities  will  please  the  market  and make  those  jurisdictions  all  the  more  popular  and  prosperous.  In  this sense, certain regulations may be compared to the house rules imposed by the proprietors of a hotel chain. If they prohibit people from walking barefoot  or  smoking  in  the  lobby,  they  will  no  doubt  lose  certain customers.  But  turning  away  those  customers  may  not  cost  the jurisdiction  customers  overall,  or  even  reduce  its  total  revenues.  Well-shod nonsmokers may pay more precisely because barefoot smokers are excluded.  Equally,  regulations  that  make  it  costly  or  impossible  to operate a rendering plant in a certain jurisdiction may drive the rendering elsewhere without depriving the jurisdiction as a whole of income. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These examples demonstrate how regulations may in rare circumstances have a positive rather than a negative market value, especially in a world with a rapidly mulitiplying number of jurisdictions. Rules that preserve high standards of public health, clean air, and clean water will be highly valued in many locales. So will other, sometimes more exotic regulations and  covenants  of  the  kind  that  might  be  imposed  by  real  estate developers or hotels catering to certain market segments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">180</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  expect  the  commercialization  of  sovereignty  to  rapidly  lead  to  the devolution  of  many  large  territorial  sovereignties.  The  very  fact  that information  technology  cannot  be  subjected  to  border  controls  of  the kind that can still impede the trade of manufactures and farm goods has important implications. It means that protectionism will be less effective over  time  as  trade  in  information  displaces  physical  products  in  the generation of wealth. It also means that smaller regions will be ever less dependent  upon  the  maintenance  of  extensive  political  jurisdictions  in order to assure access to markets in which they can earn income. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  exposes  people  working  in  formerly  protected service sectors to foreign competition. If a firm in Toronto wished to hire a bookkeeper twenty years ago, that person had to be physically located in Toronto, or in a nearby community within commuting distance. In the 290</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-292"></a>Information  Age,  a  bookkeeper  in  Budapest  or  Bangalore,  India,  could do the job, and download all the material needed in encrypted form over the  Internet.  Instant  communication  through  satellite  links  makes  any part of the world only a moment away by modem and fax. Someone in need of stock analysts could hire twenty-seven in India for the price of one on Wall Street. As information technology improves by a magnitude or more every eighteen months (Moore's Law), ever-greater numbers of service-sector  workers  will  be  exposed  to  price  competition  that  is essentially  beyond  the  capacity  of  politicians  to  impede.  This competition will eventually apply as fully to the learned professions as to bookkeepers.  Digital  lawyers  and  cyberdoctors  will  proliferate  in  the Information Economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Death Watch for NationStates</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">With the economic benefits formerly captured within the boundaries of nationstates  falling  away,  the  nationstates  themselves  will  eventually collapse under their weighty liabilities. But the fact that all nationstates are on a death watch does not mean that they are all destined to expire at the  same  moment.  Far  from  it.  Devolutionary  pressures  will  tend  to  be most  intense  in  large  political  entities  where  incomes  for  most  of  the population  are  stagnant  or  falling.  Jurisdictions  in  Latin  America  and Asia  where  per  capita  income  is  rising  rapidly  may  endure  for generations, or until lifetime income prospects there equate with those in the formerly rich industrial countries. At that point, there will no longer be easy cost-substituting gains to be had, and the politics of growth will become more challenging. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  also  suspect  that  nationstates  with  a  single  major  metropolis  will remain  coherent  longer  than  those  with  several  big  cities,  which  imply multiple centers of interest with their various hinterlands. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  spur  to  devolution  will  be  high  indebtedness  of  the  central government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  three  wealthy  industrial  countries  with  the  highest  relative indebtedness-Canada,  Belgium,  and  Italy-are  not  coincidentally  nations with advanced separatist movements. </p>

<p class="calibre1">291</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-293"></a>All three countries have suffered from chronic budget deficits and now have national debts that exceed 100 percent of GDI: As the national debt has mounted in each country, 181</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  appeal  of  separatist  movements  has  grown  as  well.  In  Italy,  the Northern  League  has  emerged  as  a  dynamic  and  popular  regional political  movement.  Its  platform  is  based  upon  a  simple  mathematical observation:  northern  Italy,  or  "Padoni  a,"  would  be  richer  than Switzerland  if  large  portions  of  its  income  were  not  siphoned  off  to subsidize Rome and the poorer south. The Northern League proposes an obvious  solution:  secede  from  Italy,  and  thus  escape  from  some  of  the dire consequences of compound interest. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Likewise,  in  Belgium,  where  the  national  debt  exceeds  130  percent  of GDP the Flemings and Walloons are maneuvering like a hostile couple before  a  divorce.  A  growing  minority  among  the  Flemings  argue  that they  are  unfairly  subsidizing  the  Walloons,  and  could  improve  their economic condition by splitting Belgium in two. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Canada's case differs in the detail that French Canada, the main region now agitating for separatism, has historically been subsidized by English Canada.  But  as  the  federal  debt  and  deficit  mount,  the  realization  is dawning in Quebec that this form of income redistribution will decline. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Bloc Quebecois is therefore flirting with an appeal that it lacked a decade  ago-the  promise  to  raise  after-tax  income  by  abolishing  the payment  of  Canadian  federal  tax.  Separatist  leaders  also  suggest  that Quebec should leave Canada without shouldering a proportionate burden of the federal debt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">English Canadians resist this argument and tend to resent its implications because  they  are  keenly  aware  of  the  large  transfers  made  to  Quebec over the years. Nonetheless, the appeal of the Parti Quebecois is strong, and it seems only a matter of time until a secession referendum dissolves Canada.  A  similar  fate  awaits  other  nationstates  when  their  financial circumstances deteriorate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another factor that bodes ill for Canada's long-term survival is the fact that  it  is  a  thinly  populated  country  with  a  sprawling  industrial-era infrastructure  to  maintain.  The  transition  to  the  Information  Age  is 292</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-294"></a>inevitably depreciating physical infrastructure. As telecommuters replace factory  employees  and  office  workers,  it  will  matter  less  whether freeways  and  other  transportation  thoroughfares  are  rebuilt  and  well-maintained.  With  fiscal  crises  pinching  on  all  sides,  more  and  more factions  in  Canadian  life  will  retreat  to  the  eighteenth-century exclusionary view of the financing of public goods advocated by Adam Smith. He wrote in  <i class="calibre3">The Wealth of Nations</i>: Were the streets of London to be  lighted  and  paved  at  the  expense  of  the  [national]  treasury,  is  there any probability that they would be so well lighted and paved as they are at present, or even at so small an expense. The expense, besides, instead of  being  raised  by  a  local  tax  upon  the  inhabitants  of  each  particular street, parish or district in London would, in this case, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the state, and would consequently be raised by a tax  upon  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  kingdom,  of  whom  the  greater  part derived no sort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the streets of London.' 14</p>

<p class="calibre1">For London, substitute Toronto, and you are inside an equation that will be running in the minds of many in Alberta and British Columbia. The logic of devolution will prove infectious. </p>

<p class="calibre1">182</p>

<p class="calibre1">When  Canada  breaks  apart,  this  will  lead  to  a  marked  increase  in secessionist  activity  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  of  the  United  States. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Residents  of  Alaska,  Washington,  Oregon,  Idaho,  and  Montana  would find  themselves  at  a  distinct  disadvantage  in  competition  with  Alberta and British Columbia as independent sovereignties. </p>

<p class="calibre1">293</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-295"></a><b class="calibre4">AFTER THE NATIONSTATE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In the place of nationstates you will see, at first, smaller jurisdictions at the  provincial  level,  and  ultimately,  smaller  sovereignties,  enclaves  of various  kinds  like  medieval  city-states  surrounded  by  their  hinterlands. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As strange as it may seem to people inculcated with the importance of politics, policies of these new ministates will in many cases be informed more by entrepreneurial positioning than by political wrangling. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These new, fragmented sovereignties will cater to different tastes, just as hotels  and  restaurants  do,  enforcing  specific  regulations  within  their public spaces that appeal to the market segments from which they draw their  customers.  This  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  there  are  not  special problems arising from the organization of protection on a nomadic basis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We address these in the next chapter. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Town air brings freedom." </i> MEDIEVAL ADAGE</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Non citizens of the Pale</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">These difficulties notwithstanding, human ingenuity usually finds a way to create institutions to capture profitable opportunities, even where the demand  arises  from  persons  who  can  pay  little.  Where  the  potential customers  are  among  the  wealthiest  persons  on  earth,  that  tendency should  be  all  the  more  emphatic.  Exit,  or  "voting  with  your  feet,"  is always  an  option  when  dated  products,  organizations,  or  even governments  lose  their  appeal  and  seem  to  offer  little  prospect  of immediate improvement. Consider, for example, the growth of medieval towns  that  served  as  safe  havens  for  serfs  escaping  feudal  subjugation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  role  may  prove  analogous  to  the  role  of  new  jurisdictions  in accommodating  the  coming  exit  from  nationstates.  The  acceptance  of aliens  escaping  from  some  lord  as  "citizens  of  the  pale"  defied  the prevailing  conventions  of  feudal  law  and  Episcopal  authority.  But nonetheless  it  was  a  generally  successful  alternative  for  those  who employed  it,  contributing  importantly  to  weakening  the  grip  of feudalism. As medieval historian Fritz Rorig put it, the serf of a secular lord would be "a free burgher of the town after a year and a day." ' It is reasonable  to  expect  new  institutional  refuges  to  spring  up,  upon  "new 294</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-296"></a>legal principles," to provide fiscal refuge to citizens of the state, much as the medieval town offered refuge to feudal subjects who lived within the shadows of its walls. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Economist Albert O. Hirschman, who explored the theoretical subtleties of "voting with your feet" in  <i class="calibre3">Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</i>, first published in 1969, foresaw that technological advances would increase the likelihood of exit as a strategy for dealing with states in decline. He wrote, "Only as countries start to resemble each other because 183</p>

<p class="calibre1">of the advances in communication and all-round modernization will the danger of premature and excessive exits arise …” </p>

<p class="calibre1">That  is  precisely  what  is  happening.  Information  technology  is  rapidly diminishing many of the differences among jurisdictions, making exit a much more attractive option. Of course, "premature and excessive exits" </p>

<p class="calibre1">in Hirschman's vocabulary are understood from the point of view of what is  optimal  for  the  state  being  deserted.  No  doubt  lords  in  medieval Europe believed that they suffered from "premature and excessive exits" </p>

<p class="calibre1">of their serfs into towns where they achieved freedom. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To return to our earlier example, it is not as farfetched as it might seem to  suppose  that  there  will  be  a  number  of  ministates  offering  refuge  to exiles  fleeing  the  dying  nationstates.  These  sovereignties  will  compete on terms and conditions of exile. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some, perhaps on the West Coast of North America, may well cater to people who do not smoke and are intolerant of secondhand smoke from those  who  do.  Obviously,  such  regimes  would  not  be  popular  with smokers. Rules banning their habit will seem an arbitrary imposition to many smokers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  industrial  era  of  mass  politics,  such  differences  of  opinion  were fought out in political campaigns that ultimately forced one group or the other to abide by the wishes of the more powerful. But it is by no means essential that contentions about mutually exclusive choices be settled in a way  that  requires  that  the  preferences  of  large  numbers  of  people  be suppressed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">295</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-297"></a>Some individuals like to eat foie gras and others like hot dogs, and others still  eat  soya  curd.  They  usually  do  not  have  to  argue  about  their  diet preferences  because  their  culinary  choices  are  not  bound  together.  No one forces all to consume the same meal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Megapolitical  conditions  did,  however,  force  common  consumption  of many  kinds  of  collective  and  even  private  goods  provided  by governments in the industrial era. Why? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  there  were  great  economic  advantages  to  be  captured  by operating  at  a  large  scale.  It  was  therefore  impractical  to  divide sprawling jurisdictions into enclaves where everyone could have his own way,  even  on  important  items.  The  exclusionary  approach  to  the provision of public goods argued by Adam Smith can be far more easily accommodated  when  the  number  of  jurisdictions  multiplies  by  ten  or even a hundred times over. In the Information Age, growing numbers of sovereignties  will  be  small  enclaves  rather  than  continental  empires. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some  may  be  North  American  Indian  bands  who  will  claim  tax jurisdiction over their reservations and reserves much as they now claim the right to operate gambling casinos or to fish in defiance of limits. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  information  technology  eliminates  many  of  the  drawbacks  of devolving trading areas, it will be practical for the new sovereignties to operate more on the principles of clubs or affinity groups than those that governed territorial nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Just as it is not crucial that every potential customer share the same taste in  clothes,  or  watch  the  same  television  programs,  it  will  be  less important than it may seem that everyone agree with affinity points that define the governing style of fragmented sovereignties. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Widely  dispersed  tastes  will  result  in  widely  divergent  styles  of fragmented sovereignty, much as there are increasingly wide choices in clothing  style  or  television  broadcasts.  Some  microstates  may  even  be linked like hotel groups in franchises, or 184</p>

<p class="calibre1">operate  together  to  achieve  advantages  in  police  functions  and  other residual services of government. Those who like clean streets and resent finding gum under tabletops will find Singapore fetching. Fans of Beavis 296</p>

Customers uncomfortable with mores in one jurisdiction will be welcomed in others.

<p class="calibre1">GILDER</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  peculiar  irony  of  the  reemergence  of  micro-sovereignties  or  "city-states" is that it may coincide with the emptying out of many cities. The large  city  was  largely  an  artifact  of  industrialism  in  the  West.  It  arose with the factory system to capture scale economies in the manufacture of products with high natural resource content. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When the nineteenth century opened, cities of more than 100,000 were considered  huge,  and  outside  of  Asia,  where  population  statistics  were doubtful, there were no cities of more than a million persons. The largest city in the United States in 1800 was Philadelphia, with a population of 69,403. New York had just 60,489. Baltimore was the third largest city in America with 26,114 inhabitants. Most of what were to become the great metropolitan  cities  of  Europe  had  populations  that  are  tiny  by twentiethcentury standards. London, with a population of 864,845, was probably the biggest city in the world. Paris, with 547,756, was the only other city in Europe with more than half a million inhabitants in 1801. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lisbon's population was 350,000. Vienna had a population of 252,000.21</p>

<p class="calibre1">Berlin  had  barely  poked  above  200,000  by  1819.  Madrid  was  home  to 156,670. The population of Brussels in 1802 was 66,297. Budapest had a population of just 61,000. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There is an obvious temptation to think that the growth of big cities is a direct function of population growth. But this is not necessarily so. Every 297</p>

<p class="calibre1">As Adna Weber argued in the classic study The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth  Century,  population  growth  alone  does  not  explain  why people live in urban settings rather than dispersed in the countryside. In 1890,  Bengal  had  about  the  same  population  density  as  England.  Yet Bengal's urban population was just 4.8 percent, while England's was 61.7</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent.25</p>

<p class="calibre1">Historically,  cities  were  walled  off  from  the  countryside  to  keep marauders  and  the  lower  classes  out.  The  growth  of  industrial employment in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries created big cities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now  the  big  city  has  become  highly  vulnerable  to  breakdown  as industrialism has begun to fade. The perfect marker of this development is Detroit, the leading industrial city of the mid-twentieth century. At one time,  a  large  fraction  of  the  world's  industrial  output  passed  through Detroit. Now it is a hollowed-out 185</p>

<p class="calibre1">shell,  ridden  by  crime  and  disorder.  In  many  blocks  of  downtown Detroit, one or more derelict buildings have been burned to the ground or torn down, leaving the impression that the city has survived a series of raids by World War II bombers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Detroit  stands  as  a  reminder  that  many  industrial  cities  are  no  longer viable. They will crumble away as information and ideas become more Important  factors  imparting  value  than  fabricating  from  natural resources.  In  many  cases,  the  large  city  has  already  grown  too  large  to support its own weight. To keep a metropolis functioning requires that a substantial number of support systems operate effectively at large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The very crowding together of millions of people implies a huge jump in vulnerability  to  crime,  sabotage,  and  random  violence.  During  the industrial era, the price of policing against these risks was repaid by the high-scale economies of production. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  only  cities  that  repay  their  upkeep  costs  by offering  a  high  quality  of  life  will  remain  viable.  Persons  at  a  distance will  no  longer  be  obliged  to  subsidize  them.  A  good  marker  for  the viability of cities is whether those living at the core of the city are richer than those on its periphery. Buenos Aires, London, and Paris will remain 298</p>

<p class="calibre1">Some  city-states  may  prove  to  be  merely  enclaves  with  no  cities attached. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  they  might  be  better  thought  of  as  village  states  or  country states. Natural resource endowments will be valued in different ways as well. When you can do business anywhere, you may well choose to do business  in  a  beautiful  place  where  you  can  breathe  deeply  without inhaling too much carcinogenic pollution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Communications  technologies  that  minimize  language  difficulties  will make  it  ever  easier  to  abide  almost  anywhere  that  the  environment  is attractive. Thinly populated regions with temperate climates, and a large endowment  of  arable  land  per  head,  like  New  Zealand  and  Argentina, will  also  enjoy  a  comparative  advantage  because  they  enjoy  high standards  of  public  health  and  are  low-cost  producers  of  foods  and renewable  products.  Such  products  will  benefit  from  increased  demand as  the  living  standards  of  billions  of  people  in  East  Asia  and  Latin America rise. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Inequivalence Theorem</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Many of the assumptions of economists about behavior are rooted in the tyranny  of  place.  A  distinct  example  is  Ricardo's  "Equivalence Theorem,"  which  suggests  that  citizens  in  a  country  that  runs  huge deficits  will  adjust  their  expectations  in  anticipation  of  higher  tax  rates needed  in  the  future  to  retire  the  debt.  In  this  sense,  there  is  an</p>

<p class="calibre1">"equivalence" between financing spending by taxation and through debt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At  least  there  was  such  an  equivalence  in  the  early  nineteenth  century when  Ricardo  wrote.  In  the  Information  Age,  however,  the  rational person will not respond to the prospect of higher taxes to fund deficits by increasing his savings rate; he will transfer his domicile, or lodge 186</p>

<p class="calibre1">his  transactions  elsewhere.  For  the  same  reason  that  producers  sort among  suppliers  in  search  of  the  lowest  costs,  they  will  be  even  more 299</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-301"></a>strongly  motivated  to  seek  alternative  suppliers  of  protection.  The benefits of doing so will dwarf the margins to be realized by shifting to a new supplier of plastic tubes. The result to be expected is that Sovereign Individuals  and  other  rational  people  will  flee  jurisdictions  with  large unfunded liabilities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Cheap  governments  that  have  few  liabilities  and  impose  low  costs  on customers  will  be  the  domiciles  of  choice  for  wealth  creation  in  the Information Age. This implies much more attractive prospects for doing business  in  areas  where  indebtedness  is  low  and  governments  have already been restructured, such as New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, and other parts of Asia and Latin America. These areas will also  be  superior  platforms  for  doing  business  to  unreformed,  high-cost economies in North America and Western Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Greatly  reduced  information  costs  will  obviate  most  local  pricing advantages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not  only  will  buyers  be  able  to  scan  an  immense  number  of  outlets  in search of the lowest prices on tradable goods; they will also be able to employ  remote  services  to  shop  across  jurisdictional  boundaries.  This will allow people to much more easily compare features of difficult-to-analyze  products  like  insurance.  And  it  will  bypass  restraints  of  trade imposed by local licensing procedures. Consequently, profit margins are likely to fall in any field where local price anomalies can be eroded by additional information and competition. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-302"></a><b class="calibre4">NEW ORGANIZATIONAL IMPERATIVES</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The cybereconomy will significantly differ from the industrial economy in the way its participants interact. Information technology will dissipate many of the long-term organizational advantages of firms that arise from high transaction and information costs. The Information Age will be the age of the "virtual corporation." Many analysts more knowledgeable than we are about information technology have utterly failed to see that it is destined to transform the logic of economic organization. Not only does the new technology transcend borders and barriers; it also revolutionizes the "internal" costs of computation. Even the few businesses that will not be  affected  by  exposure  to  greater  cross-border  competition  because  of improving  information  and  communication  technology  will  be  exposed to  new  organizational  imperatives.  Rapidly  falling  information  and transaction costs will decisively lower economies to scale, voiding many of  the  incentives  that  gave  rise  to  long-lived  firms  and  career employment during the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Why Firms? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">187</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  classical  economists  like  Adam  Smith  were  almost  silent  on  the question of firm size. They did not address what influences the optimal size of firms, why firms take the form they do, or even why firms exist at all. Why do entrepreneurs hire employees, rather than placing every task that needs doing out to bid among independent contractors in the auction market? Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase helped launch a new direction in economics by asking some of these important questions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The answers he helped to frame hint at the revolutionary consequences of  information  technology  for  the  structure  of  business.  Coase  argued that  firms  were  an  efficient  way  to  overcome  information  deficits  and high transaction costs.26</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Information and Transaction Costs</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  see  why,  consider  the  obstacles  you  would  have  faced  in  trying  to operate  an  industrial-era  assembly  line  without  a  single  firm  to 301</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-303"></a>coordinate  its  activities.  In  principle,  an  automobile  could  have  been produced without production being centralized under the oversight of a single firm. Economist Oliver Williamson, along with Coase, is another pioneer  in  developing  the  theory  of  the  firm.  Williamson  defined  six different  methods  of  operation  and  control.  Among  them  is  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"entrepreneurial  mode,"  "wherein  each  workstation  is  owned  and operated  by  a  specialist."27  Another  is  what  Williamson  calls  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"federated workstations" in which "an intermediate product is transferred across  stages  by  each  worker."28  There  is  no  physical  reason  why  the thousands  of  employees  could  not  have  been  replaced  by  a  gaggle  of independent contractors, each renting space on the factory floor, bidding for parts, and offering to assemble the axle or weld the fenders onto the chassis. Yet you would look in vain for an example of an industrial-era automobile factory organized and run by independent contractors. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Coordination Problems</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Operating  an  industrial  facility  without  the  benefit  of  coordination through a single firm would have dissipated most of the economies to be realized by operating on a large scale. Massive transaction problems in coordinating  a  patchwork  quilt  of  small  firms  would  have  effectively deautomated the assembly line. To work at all, such a system would have necessitated nonstop negotiation among the individual contractors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  focusing  on  production,  the  multitude  of  contractors  or entrepreneurs  would  have  had  to  divert  time  and  attention  to  fixing prices of components and working out the terms of their own constantly changing interactions. Simply monitoring production would have been a difficult problem. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Authority to Act</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">With  such  a  set  of  independent  organizations  struggling  to  assemble  a car,  creation  and  re-engineering  of  the  models  would  have  been  a nightmare. You need only 188</p>

<p class="calibre1">imagine the difficulty facing the designer in attempting to convince the hundreds of independent contractors on changes required to introduce a new  model.  In  practice,  almost  unanimous  consent  would  have  been 302</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-304"></a>needed.  Anyone  holding  out  or  objecting  to  any  change  in  the specification of the product could either have effectively killed the model improvement  or  raised  the  cost  of  introducing  it,  thus  further jeopardizing the gains from operating on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Unnecessary Negotiation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">An  assembly  line  rented  (or  owned  separately)  by  independent contractors would have been subject to numerous vulnerabilities avoided by operating within a single firm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  death,  illness,  or  financial  failure  of  individual  contractors  would have been an altogether too common occurrence in operations requiring the  cooperation  of  thousands  of  people  to  build  a  single  product  under one roof. The auction market would have certainly been able to replace these  contractors.  But  with  each  succession  would  have  required  a negotiated settlement, such as a buyout of the previous operator by his replacement. It also would have required an agreement on assumption of the rental of the factory space, and perhaps a new lease on the welding machine or the press used for stamping out the taillight sockets. All of this would have been complicated. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Incentive Traps</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  crucial  difficulty  with  an  assembly  line  of  independent contractors  under  the  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age  was  that  capital requirements  for  the  individual  contractors  would  have  differed dramatically. A plastic mold needed to produce a dashboard switch, for example, might have been relatively cheap, while the equipment needed to cast an engine block or stamp out the sheet metal on a fender could have  cost  millions.  The  high  resource  content  and  sequential  nature  of assembly-line production made problems arising from high capital costs inevitable,  for  reasons  analyzed  in  the  last  chapter.  Contractors  with capital-intensive  tasks  would  have  essentially  been  dependent  upon  the cooperation  of  others  to  amortize  their  investments.  The  ability  of  the contractors with higher capital requirements to raise money and operate at a profit would have depended upon their securing the cooperation of many  other  participants  in  the  process  whose  capital  costs  were  far lower. In many cases, they would not have gotten it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">303</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-305"></a>There would have been a substantial incentive for the small to exploit the great. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Those  who  required  less  money  to  operate  their  particular  function  on the  assembly  line  would  have  gained  by  failing  to  cooperate  at  crucial times. Like striking workers, they could have closed down the assembly line  on  one  pretext  or  another,  imposing  little  cost  on  themselves  but much  grief  to  those  with  larger  capital  investments.  The  production process  would  have  been  subject  to  constant  gaming,  with  small-scale contractors  exposing  those  with  higher  capital  costs  to  ransom  through their ability to thwart output. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  maneuvering  of  smaller  contractors  to  extract  side  payments  from the large would have reduced the efficiency of the system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">189</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Firm Solution</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, many of the economies to be achieved during the industrial era by  operating  an  assembly  line  on  a  large  scale  would  have  been dissipated  if  the  production  had  been  divided  among  multitudes  of individual  contractors.  The  single  large  firm  was  an  efficient  way  of overcoming these drawbacks, notwithstanding its other limitations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Big  business  was  bureaucratic.  But  to  some  extent  bureaucracy  and hierarchy  were  precisely  what  were  required  during  the  Industrial  Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Administrative  and  management  teams  monitored  and  coordinated production,  with  numerous  middle  managers  passing  orders  down  the hierarchy  and  other  information  back  up  the  chain  of  command.  The corporate  bureaucracy  also  provided  bookkeeping  and  accounting controls and minimized principal-agency problems, in which employees fail to act in the best interest of the firm that employs them. To achieve sophisticated  accountancy  under  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age required  the  work  of  many  people.  Having  such  an  administrative bureaucracy  in  place  was  costly.  It  had  to  be  paid  whether  production was active or slack. Because such administrators held crucial knowledge necessary  to  operate  the  business,  they  were  usually  paid  a  premium above what their skills would have commanded in the spot market. </p>

<p class="calibre1">304</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-306"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Organizational Slack" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The large numbers of professional managers and administrators also had the drawback of tending to "capture" the firm and operate it in their own interests rather than those of the shareholders. It was not uncommon in the industrial era, for example, to find firms spending lavishly on office furnishings, club memberships, and other perks that could be enjoyed by management  but  that  might  not  have  generated  a  direct  return  to investors. In a complicated business, it was impossible to easily monitor from the outside which overhead expenditures were essential and which were  indulgences  for  the  employees.  It  was  also  difficult  to  prevent  a sometimes  considerable  fraction  of  corporate  employees  from  shirking. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  it  was  technologically  difficult  to  monitor  performance made a large middle management necessary, and at the same time made it difficult to monitor the monitors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  conditions  all  contributed  to  what  became  known  as</p>

<p class="calibre1">"organizational slack," </p>

<p class="calibre1">a  term  coined  in  1963  by  Richard  Cyert  and  James  March  in  A Behavioral  Theory  of  the  Firm.  29  Careful  examination  suggested  that numerous real firms were underperforming their potential substantially. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"That's Not My Job" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  an  entity  aspiring  to  permanence,  the  large  industrial  firm  had  the drawback we have already explored of being exposed to shakedowns by labor  unions.  It  also  shared  some  of  the  characteristics  of  bureaucracy seen in a more exaggerated form in government offices. Orders flowed from  on  high.  Tasks  were  stereotyped  and  compartmentalized.  These tasks  were  often  rigidly  defined.  Boundaries  emerged  among  job 305</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-307"></a>categories,  akin  to  those  enforced  by  the  cartels  regulating  the  learned professions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To  have  expected  a  bookkeeper  to  change  a  burned-out  lightbulb  in  a lamp on his desk seemed as strange to many during the Industrial Age as calling  on  a  lawyer  to  help  cure  your  flu.  Employees  were  neither expected,  nor  in  many  cases  even  permitted,  to  cross  the compartmentalized boundaries between rigidly defined functions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"That  is  not  my  job"  was  a  widely  heard  slogan  that  underscored  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"organizational  slack"  of  the  Industrial  Age.  Everyone's  job  was precisely  defined  in  terms  of  stereotyped  tasks  that  were  not  to  be trespassed  upon,  however  much  that  might  improve  productivity.  Each employee  in  the  corporate  bureaucracy  was  hired  according  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">"qualifications"  deemed  likely  to  predict  performance  in  his  specific function.  With  few  exceptions,  everyone  was  paid  based  upon  a  job classification,  with  more  or  less  uniform  pay  throughout  the organization.  Because  specific  performance  in  the  administrative hierarchies  of  Big  Business  often  went  unmeasured,  as  in  state bureaucracies, work proceeded at a leisurely pace. So while the firm did capture the scale economies of mass production, it did so at the cost of other inefficiencies. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">New Imperatives</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  new  megapolitical  conditions  of  the  Information  Age  will significantly  alter  the  logic  of  business  organization.  Part  of  this  is obvious.  If  information  technology  does  nothing  else,  it  dramatically lowers  the  cost  of  processing,  computing,  and  analyzing  information. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One effect of such technology is to reduce the necessity of hiring large numbers  of  middle  managers  to  monitor  production  processes.  Indeed, 306</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-308"></a>automated  machine  tools  made  possible  by  advanced  computational power  are  in  many  cases  replacing  hourly  workers.  And  where  the production process continues to be manned, the control and coordination process  has  largely  been  automated.  Equipment  fitted  with microprocessors  can  monitor  the  progress  of  the  assembly  line  much more  effectively  than  managers  ever  could.  Not  only  can  the  new equipment measure the speed and accuracy with which people work, it can also automatically compile accounts, and 191</p>

<p class="calibre1">reorder  components  the  moment  they  are  taken  out  of  inventory.  The smallest  operations  can  now  afford  financial  control  programs  that account for their finances with greater speed and sophistication than even the  largest  corporations  could  have  achieved  through  their  production hierarchies a few decades ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fact that information technology allows for dispersed, nonsequential output  of  products  with  reduced  natural  resource  content  dramatically reduces  the  vulnerability  to  gaming  and  extortion,  as  we  have  already explored. However, these are not the only characteristics of information technology  that  make  it  ever  more  attractive  to  contract  out  functions formerly done by employees. Capital costs are lower. Product cycles are shorter.  The  independent  contractors  themselves,  including  the  one-person  firms,  have  vastly  more  sophisticated  information  networks  at their  disposal.  Soon  they  will  be  able  to  rely  upon  an  array  of  digital servants  to  perform  a  wide  variety  of  office  functions,  from  answering the  phone  to  secretarial  services.  Digital  servants  will  be  secretaries, advertising agents, travel agents, bank tellers, and bureaucrats. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Disappearance of Good Jobs</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  an  increasing  degree,  individuals  capable  of  creating  significant economic value will be able to retain most of the value they create for themselves.  Support  staff  that  previously  absorbed  a  large  part  of  the revenue generated by the principal income creators in an enterprise will be replaced by low-cost automated agents and information systems. This implies  that  an  organization  will  be  better  able  to  assure  itself  of  the highest quality of service by contracting it out, rather than by keeping the function  within  the  firm,  where  it  will  be  relatively  more  difficult  to 307</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-309"></a>reward individuals for performing a task well. A virtual corporation will eliminate most "organizational slack" by eliminating the organization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Good  jobs"  will  be  a  thing  of  the  past.  A  "good  job,"  as  Princeton economist Orly Ashenfelter put it, "is a job that pays more than you are worth."3 In the Industrial Age, many "good jobs" existed because of high information and transaction costs. Firms grew bigger and internalized a wider range of functions because doing so allowed them to capture scale economies.  Corporate  bloat  was  also  subsidized  by  tax  laws.  The  high taxes that predominated in the late stages of the industrial era artificially magnified  the  advantages  of  forming  a  long-lived  firm  and  hiring permanent  employees.  In  most  nations,  tax  laws  and  regulations substantially raised the costs of forming and dissolving firms on a project basis.  They  also  have  tended  to  force  entrepreneurs  to  subsume independent  contractors  as  employees.  Legal  interventions  further temporarily  inflated  the  supply  of  "good  jobs"  by  making  it  costly  and difficult to dismiss an employee, however little he might be contributing to the productivity of the firm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Inevitably  and  logically,  the  character  of  business  organization  in  the industrial  era  assured  that  the  most  highly  skilled  and  talented  people who  created  a  disproportionate  share  of  the  value-added  in  an organization  were  paid  proportionately  less  than  their  contribution  was worth. This will change in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">192</p>

<p class="calibre1">The microprocessing revolution is sharply increasing the availability of information  and  reducing  transaction  costs.  This  is  devolving  the  firm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  permanent  bureaucracy,  activities  will  be  organized  around projects, in much the way that movie companies already operate. Most of the  formerly  "internal"  functions  of  the  firm  will  be  outsourced  to independent  contractors.  The  industrial-era  employees  who  held  "good jobs"  but  who  contributed  little  and  relied  upon  fellow  workers  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">"cover" for them will soon find themselves bidding for contracts in the spot  market.  And  so  will  many  loyal,  diligent  employees.  "Good  jobs" </p>

<p class="calibre1">308</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-310"></a>In the extreme case of big Japanese corporations, employees expected to have a job for life. Even where they had no productive task to perform, they would be retained, sometimes merely showing up to sit at "a bare desk in the corner of a factory." Now even in Japan, the bloated white-collar  workforce  is  being  downsized.  The  headline  of  a  story  in  the International Herald-Tribune told the tale: "Parting Is Such Sour Sorrow: Japan's Job-for-Life Culture Painfully Expires." 33 In the postindustrial period, jobs will be tasks you do, not something you "have." Before the industrial era, permanent employment was almost unknown. As William Bridges  put  it,  "Before  1  800-and  long  after  in  many  cases-job  always referred  to  some  particular  task  or  undertaking,  never  to  a  role  or position  in  an  organization.  ...  Between  1700  and  1890,  the  Oxford English  Dictionary  finds  many  uses  of  terms  like  job-coachman,  job-doctor, and job-gardener-all referring to people hired on a one-time basis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jobwork  (another  frequent  term)  was  occasional  work,  not  regular employment." 34 In the Information Age, most tasks that were formerly captured  within  firms  as  an  expedient  to  reduce  information  and transaction  costs  will  migrate  back  to  the  spot  market.  "Just  in  time" </p>

<p class="calibre1">inventory  control  and  outsourcing  are  both  practical  because  of information technology. They are steps toward the death of jobs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Already,  major  corporations  such  as  AT&amp;T  have  eliminated  all permanent job categories. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Positions  in  that  large  firm  are  now  contingent.  In  Bridges's  words, </p>

<p class="calibre1">The model business organization of the new information economy may be  a  movie  production  company.  Such  enterprises  can  be  very sophisticated,  with  budgets  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  While they  are  often  large  operations,  they  are  also  temporary  in  nature.  A movie  company  producing  a  film  for  $100  million  may  come  together 309</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-311"></a>for  a  year  and  then  dissolve.  While  the  people  who  work  on  the production  are  talented,  they  have  no  expectation  that  finding  work  on the project is equivalent to having a "permanent job." When the project is  over,  the  lighting  technicians,  cameramen,  sound  engineers,  and wardrobe specialists will go their separate ways. They may be reunited in another project, or they may not. </p>

<p class="calibre1">193</p>

<p class="calibre1">As  scale  economies  fall,  and  capital  requirements  for  many  types  of information-intensive activities fall simultaneously, there will be a strong incentive for firms to dissolve. Business operations will be more ad hoc and  temporary.  Firms  will  tend  to  be  more  short-lived.  Virtual corporations  that  assemble  talents  for  specific  purposes  will  be  more efficient  than  longstanding  companies.  As  encryption  becomes widespread  and  the  taxation  of  capital  is  forced  down  by  competition, artificial scale economies that sustain the existence of "permanent" firms will  fall  away.  This  will  happen  whether  taxes  are  reduced  rapidly  or slowly. If rapidly, the artificial costs of functioning on a project basis will disappear  more  quickly.  If  slowly,  the  main  burden  of  paying  the anachronistically  high  taxes  will  fall  upon  existing  firms,  while  new enterprises  will  operate  as  virtual  corporations,  better  enabling  them  to escape costly burdens imposed by the dying nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While special skills and talents will be more important than ever in the information  economy,  most  of  the  artificial  boundaries  between professions will dissolve. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Advanced  information  and  retrieval  storage  technologies  will  make  the trade  secrets  and  specialized  information  of  professions  such  as  law, medicine,  and  accounting  available  to  anyone.  The  economic  value  of memorization as a skill will fall, while the importance of synthesis and creative application of information will rise. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  full  implications  of  this  change  will  be  retarded  by  antiquated regulation.  But  over  the  longer  term,  the  power  of  governments  to regulate  the  cybereconomy  will  wither  to  the  vanishing  point.  Any artificial regulation of professional monopolies that raises costs without benefits that are valued in the market will ultimately be ignored. </p>

<p class="calibre1">310</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-312"></a>There  are  other  implications  of  the  shift  to  an  information  economy:  •</p>

<p class="calibre1">Local  regulations  that  impose  higher  costs  will  be  transformed  to  a market footing. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  There  will  be  intensified  competition  among  jurisdictions  to  domicile high value-added activities that in principle could be located anywhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">No stopping place is necessarily more compelling than the next. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• Business relations will gravitate toward reliance upon "circles of trust." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Due to encryption, which gives individuals an ability to steal undetected, honesty  will  be  a  more  highly  valued  characteristic  of  business associates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  Patent  and  copyright  regimes  will  change,  due  to  ease  of  access  to certain information. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• Protection will become increasingly technological rather than juridical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The lower classes will be walled out. The move to gated communities is all  but  inevitable.  Walling  out  troublemakers  is  an  effective  as  well  as traditional way of minimizing criminal violence in times of weak central authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• Bulk goods will be heavily taxed and shipped locally, as in the Middle Ages,  while  luxury  goods  will  be  lightly  taxed  and  shipped  a  great distance.36</p>

<p class="calibre1">• Police functions will increasingly be taken up by private guards linked to merchant associations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">194</p>

<p class="calibre1">• There may be a transitional advantage to private over publicly traded firms because private firms will enjoy greater leeway in escaping costs imposed by governments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  Lifetime  employment  will  disappear  as  "jobs"  increasingly  become tasks or "piece work" rather than positions within an organization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  Control  over  economic  resources  will  shift  away  from  the  state  to persons  of  superior  skills  and  intelligence,  as  it  becomes  increasingly 311</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-313"></a>easy to create wealth by adding knowledge to products. </p>

<p class="calibre1">• Many members of learned professions will be displaced by interactive information-retrieval systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">•  New  survival  strategies  for  persons  of  lower  intelligence  will  evolve, involving  greater  concentration  on  development  of  leisure  skills,  sports abilities,  and  crime,  as  well  as  service  to  the  growing  numbers  of Sovereign Individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Political systems that grew up at a time when there were rising returns to violence  must  undergo  wrenching  adjustments.  Now  that  efficiency  is growing  in  importance  relative  to  the  magnitude  of  power  commanded by  a  system,  small,  efficient  sovereignties,  which  produce  more protection  for  their  customers  at  lower  cost,  will  be  increasingly sustainable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As in the medieval period, there are once again growing diseconomies of scale  in  the  organization  of  violence.  This  is  already  reflected  in  the growing number of sovereign entities since the fall of Communism. We expect the number of sovereignties in the world to multiply rapidly as the logic of the Information Age is confirmed by experience. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Power  will  once  again  be  exercised  on  a  small  scale.  Enclaves  and provinces  may  even  find  that  they  have  substantial  advantages  over nations  spanning  continents  in  offering  competitive  terms  to  their</p>

<p class="calibre1">"customers" for sovereignty services. This will be very different from the rapidly dying modern period, in which no entity could survive unless it could control military force sufficient to control a kingdom. In the past, when there were diseconomies of scale in exercising power, those who benefited most from the protection, like the wealthy merchants in the late medieval  city-states,  did  control  the  government.  In  our  view,  you  can look  for  something  like  this  again.  The  lowering  of  predatory  burdens and more efficient disposition of resources should result in rapid growth in  areas  where  customers  do  exercise  control  over  the  local sovereignties. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As we explore next, whether these developments can or should proceed in the face of opposition from legions of losers will be among the more 312</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">http://www.ibm.com</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">To  say  that  the  "world  is  getting  smaller"  is  an  informing  figure  of speech,  reinforced  by  authorities  as  prestigious  as  IBM's  advertising agency.  Their  "Solutions  for  a  small  planet"  multicultural  commercials for the Internet remind sports fans who may fail to realize it on their own that  the  terms  of  relations  between  individuals  in  widely  dispersed jurisdictions  have  been  changed  by  technology.  We  refer  to  the distinguished  historian  William  McNeill  for  a  useful  footnote  on  the implications.  He  writes,  "Continuing  intensification  of  communications and  transport,  instead  of  favoring  national  consolidation,  has  begun  to work  in  a  contrary  sense,  inasmuch  as  its  range  transcends  existing political  and  ethnic  boundaries."2  As  the  world  "becomes  smaller"  and communications  improve,  the  accidental  and  "intrinsically  absurd" </p>

<p class="calibre1">claims of nations and nationalism are bound to weaken. </p>

<p class="calibre1">316</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-318"></a><b class="calibre4">THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The trouble with this reasonable expectation is that all previous history suggests  that  it  cannot  be  accommodated  in  a  reasonable  way.  The transition it implies will involve a crisis. It entails a radically new way of thinking, a new imagining of community that moves beyond nationalism and the nationstate. As Michael Billig has highlighted, "our beliefs about nation-hood, and about the naturalness of belonging to a nation," are "the products of a particular historical age." 3 That age, the Modern Age, may already be defunct. Its predominant institutions, nationstates, still endure, but  they  survive  precariously  upon  an  eroded  foundation.  As  the  other shoe  drops,  and  nationstates  collapse,  we  expect  a  nasty  reaction, particularly  in  the  wealthy  countries  where  the  "national  economy" </p>

<p class="calibre1">brought  high  income  to  unskilled  work  in  the  twentieth  century.  We believe  that  when  all  is  said  and  done,  the  change  in  megapolitical conditions occasioned 196</p>

<p class="calibre1">by  the  advent  of  information  technology  will  result  in  radical institutional change. The thesis of this book is that the massed power of the nationstate is destined to be privatized and commercialized. Like all truly radical institutional change, the privatization and commercialization of  sovereignty  will  involve  a  revolution  in  the  "common  sense"  of  the way  the  world  is  comprehended.  Such  change  seldom  happens  in  a gradual, linear way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To the contrary. Indeed, for reasons we explored in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, it  is  practically  ruled  out.  We  expect  the  Information  Age  to  bring discontinuities-sharp  breaks  with  the  institutions  and  the  consciousness of the past. Here is what to look for as the process unfolds: 1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Changes  in  economic  organization  of  the  kind  described  in  previous chapters arising from the impact of microprocessing. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">317</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-319"></a>A  more  or  less  rapid  falloff  in  importance  of  all  organizations  that operate within rather than beyond geographic boundaries. Governments, labor unions, licensed professions, and lobbyists will be less important in the  Information  Age  than  they  became  during  the  Industrial  Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because favors and restraints of trade wrested from governments will be less useful, fewer resources will be wasted in lobbying.4</p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Wider recognition that the nationstate is obsolete, leading to widespread secession movements in many parts of the globe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A decline in the status and power of traditional elites, as well as a decline in  the  respect  accorded  the  symbols  and  beliefs  that  justify  the nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An  intense  and  even  violent  nationalist  reaction  centered  among  those who lose status, income, and power when what they consider to be their</p>

<p class="calibre1">"ordinary  life"  is  disrupted  by  political  devolution  and  new  market arrangements. Among the features of this reaction:</p>

<p class="calibre1">a. </p>

<p class="calibre1">suspicion of and opposition to globalization, free trade, "foreign" </p>

<p class="calibre1">ownership and penetration of local economies; </p>

<p class="calibre1">b. </p>

<p class="calibre1">hostility  to  immigration,  especially  of  groups  that  are  visibly  different from the former national group; </p>

<p class="calibre1">c. </p>

<p class="calibre1">popular  hatred  of  the  information  elite,  rich  people,  the  well-educated, and complaints about capital flight and disappearing jobs; 318</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-320"></a>d. </p>

<p class="calibre1">extreme  measures  by  nationalists  intent  upon  halting  the  secession  of individuals  and  regions  from  faltering  nationstates,  including  resort  to wars  and  acts  of  "ethnic  cleansing"  that  reinforce  nationalist identification  with  the  state  and  rationalize  the  state's  claims  on  people and their resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Since  it  will  be  obvious  that  information  technologies  facilitate  the escape of Sovereign Individuals from the power of the state, the reaction to the collapse of compulsion will also include a neo-Luddite attack on these new technologies and those who use them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">7. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The nationalist-Luddite reaction will not be uniform across regions and population groups: a. The reaction will be less intense in rapidly growing 197</p>

<p class="calibre1">economies  where  per  capita  income  was  low  during  the  industrial  era, and  where  the  deepening  of  markets  raises  incomes  among  all  skill groups. </p>

<p class="calibre1">b. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Reactionary  sentiments  will  be  most  intensely  felt  within  the  currently rich  countries,  and  especially  in  communities  with  high  percentages  of the value-poor and skill-poor who previously enjoyed high incomes.*</p>

<p class="calibre1">c. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Unabomber  notwithstanding,  the  neo-Luddites  will  attract  most  of their  adherents  among  those  in  the  bottom  two-thirds  of  earnings capacity within the populations of leading nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">d. </p>

<p class="calibre1">319</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-321"></a>The  nationalist  and  Luddite  reaction  will  be  strongest,  however,  not among  the  very  poor  but  among  persons  of  middling  skills, underachievers  with  credentials,  who  came  of  age  during  the  industrial era and face downward mobility. *</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  close  relation  between  skills  and  values  and,  therefore,  economic success  is  detailed  by  Lawrence  E.  Harrison  in  Who  Prospers?  How Cultural Values Shape Economic and Political Success (New York: Basic Books,  1992)  As  new  Megapolitical  conditions  give  rise  to  a  new consciousness of identity, along with new, complementary ideologies and morality, the old imperatives of nationalism will lose their appeal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">8. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  nationalist  reaction  will  peak  in  the  early  decades  of  the  new millennium,  then  fade  as  the  efficiency  of  fragmented  sovereignties proves superior to the massed power of the nationstate. We suspect that the  congenital  bullying  by  nationstates  of  alternative  jurisdictions, exemplified  by  the  Russian  invasion  of  Chechnya,  will  tend  to  deprive nations and nationalist fanatics of the sympathy of the new generations that  come  to  maturity  under  the  megapolitical  conditions  of  the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">9. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  nationstate  will  ultimately  collapse  in  fiscal  crisis.  Systemic  crises typically arise when failing institutions suffer from rising expenses and falling income-a situation that is bound to beset the leading nationstates as  retirement  benefits  and  medical  outlays  balloon  early  in  the  twenty-first  century.  As  we  write,  both  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United States are burdened with multitrillion-dollar unfunded pension liabilities (comparable  on  a  per  capita  basis)  that  neither  is  likely  to  tame.  Other leading nationstates face similarly bankrupting burdens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">320</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-322"></a><b class="calibre4">PARALLELS WITII THE RENAISSANCE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  previously  outlined  reasons  for  thinking  that  the  collapse  of  the nanny state will have consequences closely parallelling those associated with  the  collapse  of  the  institutional  monopoly  of  the  Holy  Mother Church five centuries ago. Not unlike the nationstate today, the Church then had been in a position of unchallenged predominance for centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In some respects, the Church was even more firmly established than the state became five hundred years later. The Church had long claimed to act as "the universal authority at the head of Christian society." 5 That is the  characterization  of  medieval  intellectual  historian  John  B.  Morrall. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  while  few  Europeans  would  have  disputed  the  Church's  claim  to supremacy in Christendom before the technological 198</p>

<p class="calibre1">revolution of the 1490s, the Church barely survived in its traditional role for another generation. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Privatization of Conscience</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">By  the  early  1520s,  millions  of  good  Europeans  had  rejected  the universal  authority  of  the  Catholic  Church,  a  heresy  punishable  by torture and death just a few decades previously. Indeed, many medieval European  cathedrals  and  churches  were  decorated  with  instructive carvings of heretics having their tongues torn out by demons.6</p>

<p class="calibre1">The lesson these tortures conveyed must have impressed many illiterate parishioners  who  could  have  recognized  the  victims  as  heretics  simply by their punishment. The iconography was unambiguous: heretics were those whose tongues were mutilated. Yet harsh as this punishment was, it was merely the warm-up for the ultimate punishment for heresy: death at the  stake.  To  the  Church's  dismay,  however,  the  lesson  was  not sufficiently  intimidating.  The  advent  of  the  printing  press  inflated  the supply of heretical arguments so dramatically that even the prospect of gruesome  punishment  ceased  to  deter  would-be  heretics.  Indeed,  not  a few unlucky pioneers of religious freedom in early modern Europe did pay for their assertions of spiritual independence by having their tongues cut  out.  Others  were  burned  at  the  stake.  The  agents  of  reaction  in  the Inquisition  literally  incinerated  people  for  uttering  what  we  would 321</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-323"></a>consider  ordinary  expressions  of  conscience.  All  told,  the  Reformation and the reaction it inspired cost millions their lives. Battlefield deaths in the  final  half  of  the  Thirty  Years'  War  alone  totaled  1,151,000.  Many more died from famine, disease, and at the hands of the Inquisition and other  authorities.  By  no  means  all  the  violence  was  perpetrated  by Catholic authorities. The bones of more than a thousand leading English Catholics  thought  to  have  been  brutally  murdered  by  King  Henry  VIII have  been  uncovered  at  the  Tower  of  London.  Some,  including  Sir Thomas  More  and  Bishop  St.  John  Fisher,  were  openly  executed  for refusing to abandon the old faith.8 King Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Queen Mary, on the other hand, insane with syphilis inherited from her father,  incinerated  three  hundred  Protestant  heretics  at  the  stake  in  the last two years of her reign. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such was the price paid as individuals of different persuasions asserted their religious convictions and the long-denied right to choose the church they  supported.  Seen  from  our  vantage  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth century, these expressions of personal belief were well within the range that should be protected by freedom of religion and freedom of speech. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But there was neither freedom of religion nor freedom of speech in the early  sixteenth  century.  The  authorities  of  the  day  still  drew  their bearings from the waning medieval worldview. To their eyes gestures of individual autonomy in opposition to authority, especially the plentitude potestatis (fullness of power) of the pope were outrageous and decidedly subversive.  As  theological  historian  Euan  Cameron  said,  religious reformers like Martin Luther adopted views that "meant a deliberate and decisive  break  with  the  institutional  and  spiritual  continuity  of  the  old Church."9</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Heresy and Treason</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">199</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  that  spirit,  we  anticipate  "a  deliberate  and  decisive  break"  with  the institutional and ideological continuity of the nationstate. By the end of the first quarter of the next century, millions of upright individuals will have committed the secular equivalent of sixteenth-century heresy-a kind of low treason. They will have withdrawn allegiance from the faltering nationstate to assert their own sovereignty, their right to choose not their 322</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-324"></a>bishops  or  their  house  of  worship  but  their  form  of  governance  as customers. The privatization of sovereignty will parallel the privatization of  conscience  of  five  centuries  earlier.  Both  are  the  mass  defection  of former supporters of dominant institutions. As Albert 0. Hirschman, an expert  of  "responses  to  decline  in  firms,  organizations  and  states,"  has written, this type of exit is difficult because "exit has often been branded as  criminal,  for  it  has  been  labeled  desertion,  defection  and  treason." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sovereign Individuals will no longer merely accede to what is imposed upon  them  as  human  resources  of  the  state.  Millions  will  shed  the obligations  of  citizenship  to  become  customers  for  the  useful  services governments  provide.  Indeed,  they  will  create  and  patronize  parallel institutions  that  will  place  most  of  the  services  associated  with citizenship  on  an  entirely  commercial  basis.  For  most  of  the  twentieth century, the productive have been treated as assets by the state, in much the way that the dairy farmer treats milk cows. They have been squeezed ever more vigorously. Now the cows will sprout wings. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Defection from Citizenship</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Just  as  new  megapolitical  conditions  undermined  the  monopoly  of  the Church  in  the  sixteenth  century,  we  expect  the  megapolitics  of  the Information  Age  to  ultimately  dictate  the  terms  of  governance  in  the twenty-first century, no matter how outrageous its new terms may seem to those who incorporate the values of modern politics as their own. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The evolution from the status of "citizen" to that of "customer" entails a betrayal of the past as sharp as the transition from chivalry to citizenship in  the  early  modern  era.  The  defection  of  the  information  elite  from citizenship  will  have  a  stimulus  much  like  that  which  led  millions  of Europeans five hundred years earlier to renounce the infallibility of the pope. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If the parallel with the Reformation is not compelling, it may be partly because it is not immediately evident today that renunciation of loyalty to religious institutions was ever the big deal that treason became in the twentieth century. Outside of a few Islamic countries, heresy at the end of the twentieth century is a spiritual misdemeanor, no more shattering to an individual's reputation than a speeding ticket for driving forty-five in a  thirty-mile  zone.*  Indeed,  it  is  not  uncommon  in  Europe  and  North 323</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-325"></a>America to find clergy and even bishops who do not believe in God or deny  crucial  tenets  of  the  faith  they  espouse.  Today,  a  heresy  would almost need to be blatant devil worship to be noticeable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  most  Western  countries,  religious  doctrines  are  so  ill-formed  and sloppily  held  that  few  persons  can  identify  the  theological  points  that were the focus of controversy of heresies in the past.11 This reflects the general shift of attention away from religion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">200</p>

<p class="calibre1">To  some  extent,  religious  leaders  have  actually  helped  to  lead  the  late-twentiethcentury  defection  from  seriousness  about  spiritual  issues  by deflecting  their  energies  away  from  spiritual  preoccupations  to  become lobbyists and social agitators. Drawn like loose filings to the magnet of power, they devote much of their activities to pressuring political leaders to adopt redistributive policies crucial to the nationalist bargain. Witness the  loud  efforts  of  the  Catholic  Church  in  Argentina  to  pressure  the government of President Carlos Menem to abandon economic reforms in favor  of  conventional  inflationary  monetary  and  Keynesian  fiscal policies.  Similar  complaints  have  been  lodged  by  religious  leaders against efforts to restructure bloated budgets in New Zealand and many other  countries.  Catholic  bishops  lobbied  vigorously  against  the  reform of welfare in the United States. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A Fiscal Inquisition? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Simply put, contemporary religious leaders focus much of their declining moral authority on secular redemption and agitation to influence the state rather than on spiritual salvation. Given this record, they can be expected to participate as accomplices in the reaction against the coming secular reformation.  As  the  nationstate  is  challenged  and  begins  to  wobble,  it will no longer be able to fulfill the promises of material benefits that are central to popular support. The de facto bargain struck at the time of the French  Revolution  will  lapse.  The  state  will  no  longer  be  capable  of guaranteeing  its  citizens  low-cost  or  free  schooling,  much  less  medical care, unemployment insurance, and pensions in exchange for otherwise poorly paid military service. While the changing requirements of warfare will enable governments to defend themselves and territories under their 324</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-326"></a>dominion  without  fielding  mass  armies,  this  will  hardly  relieve governments  of  the  criticism  for  breaking  what  has  become  an anachronistic bargain. Indeed, as the new megapolitical logic takes hold, its consequences will prove wildly unpopular with the losers in the new information  economy.  It  is  therefore  all  but  certain  that  many  religious leaders,  along  with  the  primary  beneficiaries  of  government  spending, will  be  at  the  forefront  of  a  nostalgic  reaction  seeking  to  reassert  the claims  of  nationalism.  They  will  claim  that  no  American,  Frenchman, Canadian, or other nationality-fill in the blank should be allowed to go to bed hungry. Even countries that have been at the forefront of reform and stand  to  benefit  disproportionately  from  "market-friendly  globalism," </p>

<p class="calibre1">like  New  Zealand,  will  be  tormented  by  reactionary  losers.  They  will seek to thwart the movement of capital and people across borders. And they will not stop there. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Demagogues, like Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party, are too lazy to think originally about how the new world will function. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But, in due course, Winston and his crew will be tipped off to the logic of  the  information  economy.  They  will  seek  to  halt  the  diffusion  of computers,  robotics,  telecommunications,  encryption,  and  other Information  Age  technologies  that  are  facilitating  the  displacement  of workers  in  almost  every  sector  of  the  global  economy.  Wherever  you turn, there are politicians who will gladly thwart the prospects for long-term  prosperity  just  to  prevent  individuals  from  declaring  their independence of politics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">By  2020,  or  roughly  five  centuries  after  Martin  Luther  nailed  his  95</p>

<p class="calibre1">subversive theses on the church door at Wittenberg, the perception of the cost/benefit  ratios  of  citizenship  will  have  undergone  a  similar subversive clarification. The vision of the nationstate among persons of ability  and  wealth,  the  Sovereign  Individuals  of  the  future,  will  have undergone the political equivalent of laser surgery. They will be seeing 20/20. </p>

<p class="calibre1">325</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-327"></a>In the twentieth century, as throughout the modern era, persistently high returns  to  violence  made  big  government  a  paying  proposition.  The decisiveness  of  massed  power  mobilized  the  allegiance  of  the  wealthy and  ambitious  to  OECD  nationstates,  notwithstanding  predatory  taxes imposed on income and capital. Politicians were able to impose marginal tax rates approaching or exceeding 90 percent in every OECD country in the decade immediately following World War II. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  have  explored,  the  rich  had  little  choice  but  to  accede  to  such impositions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Circumstances obliged them to rely for protection upon governments that could master violence on a large scale. It rarely mattered, except perhaps to  British  policemen  with  the  chance  to  take  a  posting  to  Hong  Kong, that OECD governments imposed monopolistic taxes. Anyone with high earnings  capacity  who  wished  to  enjoy  leading-edge  economic opportunity  during  the  Industrial  Age  usually  had  little  option  but  to reside in a high-tax economy. This meant shouldering a tax burden out of proportion to services rendered. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Arithmetic of Politics</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Nineteenth-century  American  Vice  President  John  J.  Calhoun  shrewdly sketched the arithmetic of modern politics. Calhoun's formula divides the entire  population  of  the  nationstate  into  two  classes:  taxpayers,  who contribute more to the cost of government services than they consume; and tax consumers, who receive benefits from government in excess of their contribution to the cost. With a few conspicuous exceptions, most OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs  were  net  taxpayers  to  an  exaggerated  extent  as  the twentieth century wound down. For example, in 1996, the top 1 percent of  British  taxpayers  shouldered  17  percent  of  the  total  income  tax burden.  They  paid  30  percent  more  than  the  bottom  50  percent  of earners, who contributed just 13 percent of income tax payments. In the United  States,  the  rich  shouldered  an  even  more  exaggerated  burden, with the top 1 percent paying 28</p>

<p class="calibre1">326</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-328"></a>percent of the total income tax receipts in 1994.12 Not only were the rich obliged to pay for service that, as Frederic C. Lane reminds us, "was of poor quality and outrageously overpriced," but their payments were often not proportionate to any service whatever.'3</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  benefits  for  which  the  top  taxpayers  paid  often  went  entirely  to others. In most cases, the rich were glad to under-consume government services,  which  were  typically  of  low  quality.  Government  bureaus  in almost  every  country  were  famously  inefficient,  largely  because  they tended  to  be  controlled  by  employees  who  lacked  an  incentive  to improve productivity. By practically any measure, the largest taxpayers during the 202</p>

<p class="calibre1">industrial era paid many times more for government services than they would be worth in a competitive market. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  hardly  went  unnoted.  Unhappily,  however,  the  recognition  that payments to government for protection were, in Lane's words, "wasteful by ideal standards" was seldom an actionable insight in the middle of the twentieth century. Rather it was simply a defect to be accepted, "one of various kinds of waste built into social organization." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  alternative  for  the  discontented  was  not  to  move  from  Britain  to France, for example, or from the United States to Canada. Except in rare circumstances, that would have availed little. The leading nationstates all suffered  from  the  same  drawback.  They  all  adopted  more  or  less confiscatory  tax  regimes.  To  realize  a  significant  increase  in  autonomy one  had  to  escape  the  core  countries  of  Europe  and  North  America altogether  and  head  for  the  periphery.  Tax  burdens  were  meaningfully lower  in  parts  of  Asia,  South  America,  and  on  various  remote  islands. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But there was usually a price to be paid for escaping predatory taxation-a loss of economic opportunity and, often, a decline in living standards. As we  have  explored,  in  the  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age,  economic opportunity was constrained and living standards were subpar in most of the jurisdictions outside the core industrial nationstates that indulged in confiscatory taxation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Consider the Communist systems as a paradigm. Along with many Third World regimes, they typically did not impose high income taxes-or even 327</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-329"></a>any at all.*</p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  during  the  three-quarters  of  a  century  the  Soviet  Union existed,  few,  if  any,  entrepreneurs  sought  tax  refuge  there.  While  the Soviet  income  tax  rates  were  not  high,  they  afforded  no  advantage because the Soviets made a virtue of their refusal to recognize property rights.  This  imposed  an  even  worse  burden  than  taxation.  The Communist  systems  made  it  all  but  impossible  to  organize  a  business and make any serious money. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In effect, the Communist state confiscated pretax income. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Further,  had  anyone  already  possessing  a  secure  income  for  some eccentric  reason  chosen  to  live  in  Moscow  or  Havana,  he  would  have been hard-pressed to use money to purchase a decent standard of living. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Outside  of  access  to  good  cigars,  caviar,  excellent  orchestras,  and  the ballet,  life  in  the  former  Communist  systems  afforded  few  consumer pleasures.  Most  of  the  scarce  good  things  of  life  were  unavailable  or were tightly rationed on the basis of political influence rather than open exchange.  At  the  risk  of  validating  the  stereotype  of  critics  of postmodern  life  who  emphasize  "the  importance  of  consumption  in  the postmodern  experience,"  the  rising  standard  of  goods  and  services available  worldwide  since  the  fall  of  Communism  has  surely  made competition  between  jurisdictions  more  lively,  thereby  helping  to weaken ties to nation and place.15</p>

<p class="calibre1">Under the old regime, consumer choices were so limited that even Castro himself  would  have  been  hard-pressed  to  secure  a  packet  of  decent dental  floss  had  he  wanted  to  clean  cohiba  fragments  from  his  teeth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Until recently, not even the rich in many parts of the globe could enjoy the quality of life that was common among the middle classes in Western Europe or North America. Faced with this doleful situation, most persons of outstanding talent were moved to accept the nationalist bargain during the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  stayed  put  and  paid  outrageously  high  taxes  for  the  doubtful protection  offered  by  the  particular  nationstate  that  monopolized violence in the territory in which they were born. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fall  of  Communism  removed  an  "Iron  Curtain"  that  had  impaired travel  and  effectively  blocked  the  globalization  of  commerce,  thereby keeping the world artificially "large." The jet plane, in combination with the  information  technologies  that  undermined  Communism,  increased competition for high-end travel dollars. The parade of bankers trooping in and out of even the most remote provinces was a prodigious stimulus to  the  standard  of  housing  and  cuisine  worldwide.  By  this,  we  are  not referring  to  the  spread  of  McDonald's  hamburgers  and  Kentucky  Fried Chicken franchises, in even such formerly forbidding venues as Moscow and Bucharest. Less noticed, but more important, has been the spread of leading hotel chains, and high-quality sit-down restaurants serving grand cru  clarets  rather  than  vodka  and  Coke.  Thanks  to  this  transformation, anyone who can afford it can now enjoy a high material standard of life almost anywhere on the planet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, it is now a rare country where there is not a first-class hotel and at least one restaurant that would interest a Michelin inspector. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Hirschman  anticipated  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago,  technological advance  has  significantly  increased  the  appeal  of  exit  as  a  solution  to unsatisfactory  provision  and  pricing  of  services.  He  wrote:  "Loyalty  to one's  country,  on  the  other  hand,  is  something  we  could  do  without.... </p>

<p class="calibre1">Only as countries start to resemble each other because of the advances of communications  and  all-around  modernization  will  the  danger  of premature  and  excessive  exits  arise,  the  'brain  drain'  being  a  current example."  16  Note  as  we  pointed  out  in  chapter  8  that  Hirschman's standard of "premature and excessive exits" is seen from the perspective of  the  nationstate  being  deserted,  not  from  the  perspective  of  the individual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">329</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-331"></a>Nonetheless,  his  conclusion  that  similarities  between  countries  will increase the attraction of defection and exit is unimpeachable. The fact that it is now easier to live well anywhere makes living where the cost is least  onerous  appealing.  Yet  more  important  than  the  fact  that  you  can live  well  almost  anywhere  is  the  fact  that  you  can  now  earn  a  high income  anywhere.  It  is  no  longer  necessary  to  reside  in  a  high-cost jurisdiction  in  order  to  accumulate  sufficient  wealth  to  live,  as  Lord Keynes  advised,  "wisely,  agreeably  and  well."  For  reasons  we  have already explored, microtechnology changes the underlying megapolitical foundation  upon  which  the  nationstate  rests.  In  the  Information  Age,  a new cybereconomy will emerge beyond the capacity of any government to monopolize. For the first time, technology will enable individuals to accumulate wealth in a realm that cannot be bent easily to the demands of systematic compulsion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  new  society,  and  therefore  the  new  culture,  will  be  defined  at  one end by what machines can do better than people, by automation that will do away with increasing numbers of low-skill tasks, and at the other by the power that information technology gives to people who actually have the talent to take advantage of it. Such a 204</p>

<p class="calibre1">society will have greater tensions between a small class, who might be termed the information aristocracy, and a growing underclass, who might be  termed  the  information  poor.  One  of  the  differences  between  them will be that the information poor will either be tied by geography or will find  little  benefit  from  moving.  The  information  aristocracy,  as  we discuss  elsewhere,  will  be  extremely  mobile,  since  they  will  be  able  to earn  money  in  any  locale  that  is  attractive  to  them,  just  as  popular novelists  have  always  been  able  to  do.  Robert  Louis  Stevenson  could earn his living on an island in the Pacific a hundred years ago; now the information aristocracy can all do the same thing. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Market Competition Between Jurisdictions</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Because information technology transcends the tyranny of place, it will automatically  expose  jurisdictions  everywhere  to  defacto  global competition  on  the  basis  of  quality  and  price.  In  other  words, governments  exercising  local  territorial  monopolies,  like  most  other entities, finally will be subject to real market competition on the basis of 330</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-332"></a>how well they serve their customers. This will soon make it unavoidably obvious that the old logic that favored high-cost regimes in the industrial era  has  reversed.  Leading  nationstates,  with  their  predatory, redistributive tax regimes and heavy-handed regulations, will no longer be  jurisdictions  of  choice.  Seen  dispassionately,  they  offer  poor-quality protection and diminished economic opportunity at monopoly prices. In the years to come, they may prove to be more socially unreceptive and violent  than  regions  of  Asia  and  Latin  America  where  incomes  have traditionally  been  more  unequal.  The  leading  welfare  states  will  lose their most talented citizens through desertion. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The "Extranational" Age Ahead</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As the era of the "Sovereign Individual" takes shape, many of the ablest people will cease to think of themselves as party to a nation, as "British" </p>

<p class="calibre1">or "American" or "Canadian." A new "transnational" or "extranational" </p>

<p class="calibre1">understanding of the world and a new way of identifying one's place in it await  discovery  in  the  new  millennium.  This  new  equation  of  identity, unlike  nationality,  will  not  be  a  product  of  the  systematic  compulsion that  made  nationstates  and  the  state  system  universal  in  the  twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  mere  fact  that  developments  embracing  the  whole  globe  are commonly described as "international" shows how deeply the nationalist paradigm has penetrated into our way of conceiving the world. After two centuries  of  indoctrination  in  the  mysteries  of  "international  relations" </p>

<p class="calibre1">and "international law," it is easy to overlook that "international" is not a longstanding  Western  concept.  In  fact,  the  word  international  was invented by Jeremy Bentham in 1789. It was first used in his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation. Bentham wrote, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"The word international, it must be acknowledged, is a new one, though it is hoped sufficiently analogous and intelligible." The word caught on, but not just in the narrow sense that Bentham 205</p>

<p class="calibre1">intended. "International" came to be a sloppy synonym for anything that happens across the globe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  International  Age  began  in  1789,  the  same  year  as  the  French Revolution.  It  lasted  for  two  centuries,  until  1989,  when  the  revolt 331</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-333"></a>against  Communism  in  Europe  began.  We  believe  that  that  second revolution  marked  the  end  of  the  International  Age,  and  not  merely because the discredited Communist anthem was "The International." The command  economy  with  state  ownership  was  the  most  ambitious expression of the nationstate. The close relationship between state power and nationalism was reflected in language. The most aggressive verb of the  Modern  Age  was  "to  nationalize,"  meaning  to  bring  under  state ownership and control. It was a word that tripped easily off the tongues of demagogues in most parts of the globe during the International Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now it is part of the vocabulary of the past. Nationalization has become anachronistic, precisely because state power has become anachronistic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the twilight of the modern era, the concentrated power of the state was undermined  by  the  interaction  between  technological  innovation  and market forces. Now the next stage in the triumph of the market is about to unfold. Not only will individual nationstates begin to dissolve, but in our view even the club for nationstates, the United Nations, is destined to go  bankrupt.  We  would  not  be  surprised  to  see  the  UN  liquidated sometime soon after the turn of the millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  "international"  were  a  stock,  now  would  be  the  time  to  sell.  The concept  is  likely  to  be  supplanted  in  the  new  millennium,  or  at  least narrowed  to  its  original  meaning  for  the  compelling  reason  that  the whole  world  will  no  longer  be  dominated  by  a  system  of  interrelating sovereign nations. Relations will take on the novel "extranational" </p>

<p class="calibre1">forms  dictated  by  the  growing  importance  of  microjurisdictions  and Sovereign  Individuals.  A  dispute  between  an  enclave  on  the  coast  of Labrador and a Sovereign Individual will not rightly be described as an</p>

<p class="calibre1">"international" dispute. It will be extranational. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  age  to  come,  communities  and  allegiances  will  not  be territorially  bounded.  Identification  will  be  more  precisely  targeted  to genuine  affinities,  shared  beliefs,  shared  interests,  and  shared  genes, rather  than  the  bogus  affinities  so  prominent  in  the  attention  of nationalists.  Protection  will  be  organized  in  new  ways  that  cannot  be parsed by a sextant, a plumb line, or other early modern instruments in a surveyor's kit that demarcate territorial borders. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The idea that humans must naturally place themselves in an "invented" </p>

<p class="calibre1">community  called  a  nation  will  come  to  be  seen  by  the  cosmopolitan elite as eccentric and unreasonable in the next century, as it would have been  through  most  of  human  existence.  The  nationstate,  as  sociologist Anthony Giddens wrote, has "no precedent in history." 8 Michael Billig, an authority on nationalism, amplified that point: At other times people did  not  hold  the  notions  of  language  and  dialect,  let  alone  those  of territory  and  sovereignty,  which  are  so  commonplace  today  and  which 206</p>

<p class="calibre1">seem so materially real to "us." So strongly are such notions embedded in  contemporary  common  sense  that  it  is  easy  to  forget  that  they  are invented  permanencies.  The  mediaeval  cobblers  in  the  workshops  of Montaillou  or  San  Mateo  might,  with  the  distance  of  700  years,  now appear  to  us  narrow,  superstition-bound  figures.  But  they  would  have found our ideas on language and nation strangely mystical; they would be puzzled why this mysticism could be a matter of life and death.'9</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  suspect  that  thinking  people  in  the  extranational  future  will  be equally  puzzled.  As  Benedict  Anderson  put  it,  nations  are  "imagined communities."20 This is not to say that what is imagined is necessarily trivial. As Dr. Johnson observed, if not for imagination, a man would as gladly "lie with a chamber maid as a duchess." Still, for those who came of age during the twentieth century, "nations" may seem so inevitable a unit of organization that it is difficult to grasp that they are "imagined" </p>

<p class="calibre1">rather than natural. In order to understand how different the future may be from the world with which we are familiar, it is necessary to see how nationalism has been imposed upon the "common sense" of the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  easy  to  overlook  the  degree  to  which  the  "national  community"  is formed  by  a  continuing  investment  of  imagination.  There  are  no objective criteria to define accurately which group should be a "nation" </p>

<p class="calibre1">333</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-335"></a>and which should not. Nor, strictly speaking, are there "natural frontiers," </p>

<p class="calibre1">as eminent historians Owen Lattimore and C. R. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Whittaker  have  shown.  "A  major  imperial  boundary,"  Lattimore  said, writing  of  imperial  China,  "is  not  merely  a  line  dividing  geographical regions  and  human  societies.  It  also  represents  the  optimal  limit  of growth  of  one  particular  society."  2  Or  as  Columbia  University economist Ronald Findlay put it, "Insofar as they are considered at all in economics, the boundaries of a given economic system or 'country' are generally  regarded  as  given,  along  with  the  population  living  within those  boundaries.  Yet  it  is  obvious  that,  however  sanctified  these boundaries may have become in international law, they were all at one time  or  another  contested  between  rival  claimants  and  determined ultimately  by  the  balance  of  economic  and  military  power  between  the contending parties." 22</p>

<p class="calibre1">Someone with all the data available on half the world's nationstates and a collection of fine satellite maps would not be able to predict where the boundaries of the other nationstates would fall. Nor is there any scientific way of distinguishing biologically or linguistically the members of one nationality  from  those  of  another.  No  autopsy  procedure,  however advanced,  could  distinguish  genetically  among  the  remains  of Americans, Canadians, and Sudanese after a plane crash. The boundaries between  states  and  nationalities  are  not  natural,  like  the  boundaries between species or the physical distinctions between breeds of animals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rather, they are artifacts of past and ongoing efforts to project power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, much the same can be said of languages. After centuries of nationstate  dominance,  the  idea  that  "language"  does  not  form  an objective  basis  for  distinguishing  between  peoples  may  seem  ill-considered or even absurd. But look more closely. The history of modern languages  clearly  reveals  the  degree  to  which  they  were  shaped  to reinforce  nationalist  identification.  Western  "languages"  as  we  now understand  and  speak  them  did  not  naturally  evolve  into  their  current forms.  Nor  are  they  objectively  distinguishable  from  "dialects."  In  the modern world, no one wishes to speak a "dialect." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Prior to the French Revolution, for example, the version of mongrelized Latin spoken in southern France, la langue d'oc or Occitan, had more in common with the vernacular spoken in Catalonia in northern Spain, than with  la  langue  d'oil,  the  speech  of  Paris  that  became  the  basis  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"French."  Indeed,  when  the  "Declaration  of  the  Rights  of  Man  and  the Citizen"  was  published  in  the  Parisian  style,  it  was  unintelligible  to  a majority  living  within  the  current  borders  of  France.  23  One  of  the challenges  the  French  revolutionaries  faced  was  calculating  how  to translate  their  broadsides  and  edicts  into  the  patois  of  innumerable villages that were only vaguely intelligible to one another. </p>

<p class="calibre1">335</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-337"></a>The people living within what became "France" had quite different ways of speaking that were consciously conflated into one official language as a matter of policy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Written  French  had  been  the  official  language  of  the  courts  of  justice since Francis I issued the Edict of Villers-Cotterets in 1539. 24 But this did not mean that it was widely intelligible, any more than "law French" </p>

<p class="calibre1">was  widely  intelligible  in  England  after  1200,  when  it  became  the official  language  of  the  courts  of  justice.  Each  was  an  "administrative vernacular,"  not  a  standardized  language  spoken  and  understood throughout the territory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  French  revolutionaries  wanted  to  create  something  more comprehensive, a national language. Historian Janis Langins comments in  The  Social  Histor,'  of  Language  that  "an  influential  body  of  opinion among the revolutionists believed that the triumph of the Revolution and the spread of enlightenment would be furthered by a conscious effort to impose  a  standard  French  in  the  territory  of  the  Republic."25  This</p>

<p class="calibre1">"conscious effort" </p>

<p class="calibre1">included  a  good  deal  of  fussing  over  the  use  of  individual  words. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Consider the telling example of the adjective "revolutionary," first used by  Marabou  in  1789.  After  a  period  of  "somewhat  wide  and indiscriminant use," as Langins puts it, "during the Terror there followed a period of suppression and oblivion for several decades. . . . On June 12, 1795,  the  Convention  decided  to  reform  the  language  as  well  as  the institutions  created  by  our  former  tyrants  [i.e.,  the  vanquished Robespierrists]  in  replacing  the  word  'revolutionary'  in  official designations."26 This tradition of language engineering 208</p>

<p class="calibre1">survives in the finicky reception of the French authorities to words like</p>

<p class="calibre1">"weekend" that have made their way into French from English. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Two  centuries  ago,  however,  the  national  language  engineers  in  France were  not  discriminating  merely  against  words  from  across  the  English Channel;  they  faced  a  much  bigger  job  eradicating  local  variants  of speech within the territory of the republic. This exercise was not merely confined  to  suppressing   <i class="calibre3">la  langue  d'oc</i>.  The  "French"  spoken  on  the 336</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-338"></a>Riviera then was closer to the "Italian" spoken farther to the east than to Parisian French. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Equally, the language of Alsace could arguably have been categorized as a form of German, which itself had numerous local varieties. Basque was spoken in the Pyrenees. Like Breton, spoken along the northwest coast of France,  Basque  had  little  in  common  with  any  of  the  vernacular</p>

<p class="calibre1">"dialects" of Latin that were the basis of "French." </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  were  also  substantial  numbers  of  Flemish  speakers  in  the northeast. "The Parisian style of speech," as Michael Billig reminds us, was  not  spread  through  spontaneous  market  processes,  but  "imposed, legally and culturally, as 'French.' "27</p>

<p class="calibre1">What  was  true  in  France  has  been  true  elsewhere  in  the  building  of nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Languages  were  often  carried  by  armies  and  imposed  by  colonial powers. For example, the map of Africa after independence was defined according  to  the  areas  where  the  administrative  languages  of  European powers predominated. Local dialects were seldom taught in schools. The distinctions  between  recognized  "languages,"  which  tended  to  define</p>

<p class="calibre1">"nations,"  even  nations  with  arbitrary  colonial  borders,  and  "dialects," </p>

<p class="calibre1">which did not, were in large measure political. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  short,  the  imposition  of  a  "national  language"  was  part  of  a  process used  worldwide  to  enhance  the  power  of  the  state.  Encouraging  or obliging  everyone  within  the  territory  where  the  state  monopolized violence to speak "the mother tongue" </p>

<p class="calibre1">conveyed significant advantages in facilitating the exercise of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Military Dimension of Language Unformity</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  a  world  where  returns  to  violence  were  rising,  the  adoption  of  a national  language  conveyed  military  advantages.  A  national  language was  almost  a  precondition  to  consolidation  of  central  power  in nationstates.  Central  authorities  that  encouraged  their  citizens  to  speak the same tongue were better able to weaken the military power of local magnates.  The  standardization  of  language  after  the  French  Revolution 337</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-339"></a>made  the  cheapest  and  most  effective  form  of  modern  military  force  -</p>

<p class="calibre1">national conscript armies -</p>

<p class="calibre1">feasible.  A  common  language  enabled  troops  from  all  regions  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"nation"  to  communicate  fluently  with  one  another.  This  was  a prerequisite before massed conscript armies could displace independent battalions mustered and controlled not by the central authorities but by powerful local magnates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Prior  to  the  French  Revolution,  as  we  discussed  in  Chapter  5,  troops were raised and commanded by local potentates who might or might not answer calls to battle issued from Paris or another capital. In either event, their  stance  was  determined  after  careful  negotiation.  As  Charles  Tilly notes, the "ability to give or withhold support afforded. . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">209</p>

<p class="calibre1">great bargaining power."28 Furthermore, independent military units had the additional drawback, as far as the central authorities were concerned, of  being  capable  of  resisting  government  efforts  to  commandeer domestic  resources.  Clearly,  central  authorities,  whether  King  or Revolutionary  Convention,  had  a  difficult  challenge  to  collect  taxes  or otherwise strip resources from local potentates who commanded private armies capable of defending those assets. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"National  armies"  greatly  enhanced  the  power  of  the  national government  to  impose  its  will  throughout  a  territory.  Imposition  of  a national  language  played  a  decided  role  in  facilitating  the  formation  of national  armies.  Before  national  armies  could  form  and  function effectively it was obviously useful that their various members be able to communicate fluently. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  was  therefore  a  military  plus  if  everyone  within  a  jurisdiction  could comprehend  orders  and  instructions,  as  well  as  convey  certain intelligence back along the bureaucratic chain of command. The French revolutionaries  demonstrated  the  value  of  this  almost  immediately.  In addition to running the equivalent of a language school, they also set up special  monthlong  "crash  courses"  in  which,  as  Langins  writes, 338</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-340"></a>"hundreds  of  students  from  all  over  France  would  be  trained  in  the techniques of gunpowder and cannon manufacture."29</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  military  advantage  of  the  French  approach  was  shown  by  their successes in the Napoleonic period, as well as by contrary examples of what happened to regimes that could not depend upon the mobilization benefits  of  a  common  tongue  during  war.  One  of  many  factors  that contributed  to  the  disastrous  defeats  and  demoralization  of  the  Russian forces  in  the  early  days  of  World  War  I  was  the  fact  that  the  czar's aristocratic  officer  corps  tended  to  communicate  in  German  (the  other court  language  of  the  Romanovs  was  French),  which  the  rank-and-file troops, not to mention the citizenry, did not understand. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  points  to  another  important  military  advantage  of  a  common language.  It  reduces  the  motivational  hurdles  to  fighting  a  war. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Propaganda  is  useless  if  incomprehensible.  In  this  respect  as  well,  the French revolutionaries were also well attuned to the possibilities. Their</p>

<p class="calibre1">"dominant idea," according to Langins, was "the will of the people They therefore had to identify themselves with the popular will by expressing it  in  its  own  particular  language."  30  Prior  to  1789,  mutual incomprehensibility among "citizens" was a drawback in expressing the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"will  of  the  people"  and  thus  a  check  on  the  exercise  of  power  at  the national  level.  In  more  ways  than  one,  multilingual  states  and  empires faced higher obstacles in mobilizing for war during the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At  the  margin,  therefore,  they  tended  to  be  supplanted  by  nationstates that  were  better  able  to  motivate  their  citizens  to  fight  and  mobilize resources for war. This is exemplified by nationalist consolidation, such as  the  invention  of  France  and  the  French  at  the  end  of  the  eighteenth century.  It  is  also  illustrated  by  cases  of  nationalist  devolution,  such  as the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I. The new nationstates that emerged in thc wake of the Hapsburg Empire Austria, Hungary,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Yugoslavia  were,  as  Keynes  said, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"incomplete  and  immature."  Yet  their  claims  to  form  independent nationstates grouped around national identities at least 210</p>

<p class="calibre1">partly defined by language persuaded Woodrow Wilson and other Allied leaders drawing up the Treaty of Versailles. </p>

<p class="calibre1">339</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-341"></a>The  carving  up  of  Central  Europe  after  World  War  I  illustrates  what  a double-edged sword language became in state-building. When returns to violence were rising, a common tongue facilitated the exercise of power and consolidated jurisdictions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However, when incentives to consolidate were weaker, factions formed by  minorities  around  language  disputes  also  tended  to  fracture multilingual states. The surge of separatist sentiment in the cities of the Austro-Hungarian  Empire  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  followed epidemics that devastated the German-speaking populations. Prague was a German-speaking city when the nineteenth century opened. Like other cities,  it  grew  rapidly  as  the  century  unfolded,  mostly  by  migration,  as vast numbers of landless Czech-speaking peasants were assimilated from the countryside. In the beginning, the newcomers found it necessary to learn  German  in  order  to  get  along,  so  they  did.  But  when  famine  and disease carried away large numbers of German-speaking urban residents in midcentury, they were replaced by Czech-speaking peasants. Suddenly there were so many Czech speakers that it was no longer essential for the new  residents  to  learn  German.  Prague  became  a  Czech-speaking  city and a hotbed of Czech nationalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Contemporary  separatist  movements  now  frequently  form  around language disputes in multilingual countries. This is evidently the case in Belgium and Canada, two nations that, as we noted earlier, will probably be among the first in the OECD to dissolve in the new millennium. Few governments  can  top  the  heavy-handed  actions  to  enforce  language uniformity  imposed  by  the  Parti  Quebecois  in  Quebec.31  More surprisingly,  language  grievances  also  played  a  role  in  launching  the early  activities  of  the  northern  separatists  in  Italy,  which  also  faces disintegration. In the early 1 980s, the Lombard League, as it was then known,  "declared  Lombardian  to  be  a  separate  language  from  Italian." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Billig comments, "Had the League's programme been successful during the early 1980s, and had Lombardy seceded from Italy, establishing its own  state  boundaries,  a  prediction  might  be  made:  increasingly Lombardian  would  have  come  to  be  recognized  as  different  from Italian."  32  This  is  not  an  arbitrary  assertion.  It  reflects  what  has happened  in  similar  cases.  For  example,  after  Norway  became independent in 1905, Norwegian nationalists set about a concerted effort to identify and underline features of the "Norwegian language" that were 340</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-342"></a>distinct  from  Danish  and  Swedish.  Similarly,  activists  favoring  an independent  Belarus  changed  road  signs  into  "Belarusian,"  but apparently failed to make the point that Belarusian is a separate language rather than a dialect of Russian. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now  that  the  military  imperatives  favoring  language  uniformity  have largely  been  outstripped,  we  expect  the  national  languages  to  fade,  but not without a fight. It is to be expected that the well-rehearsed adage that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"war  is  the  health  of  the  state"  will  be  tested  as  a  recuperative.  As  the nationstate  slides  into  irrelevancy,  demagogues  and  reactionaries  will foment  wars  and  conflicts,  along  the  lines  of  ethnic  and  tribal  fighting that  has  racked  the  former  Yugoslavia  and  numerous  jurisdictions  in Africa, from Burundi to Somalia. Conflicts will prove convenient for the pretexts  they  provide  for  those  seeking  to  arrest  the  trend  toward commercialization  of  sovereignty.  Wars  will  facilitate  efforts  to  sustain more exacting regimes of taxation and impose more severe 211</p>

<p class="calibre1">penalties  for  escaping  the  duties  and  burdens  of  citizenship.  Wars  will help  undergird  the  "them  and  us"  dimension  of  nationalism.  To  the proponents  of  systematic  coercion,  commercialized  sovereignty,  which gives individuals a choice of sovereignty services based upon price and quality,  will  seem  no  less  a  sin  than  the  assertion  by  individuals  of  the right  to  veto  the  judgments  of  the  pope  and  choose  their  own  path  to salvation during the Reformation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The parallel is underscored by the fact that both the new technology of printing  at  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  and  the  new  information technology at the end of the twentieth place formerly occult knowledge at  the  disposal  of  individuals  in  a  liberating  way.  The  printing  press brought  the  Scriptures  and  other  holy  texts  directly  within  the  reach  of individuals  who  previously  had  to  rely  upon  priests  and  the  church hierarchy to interpret the Word of God. The new information technology brings within the reach of anyone with a computer hook-up information about  commerce,  investment,  and  current  events  that  previously  was available  only  to  persons  at  the  pinnacle  of  government  and  corporate hierarchies. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Rock and Roll in Cyberspace</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Make  no  mistake,  the  advent  of  the  Internet  and  the  World  Wide  Web will be as destructive to nationalism as the advent of gunpowder and the printing press was conducive to nationalism. Global computer links will not  bring  back  Latin  as  a  universal  language,  but  they  will  help  shift commerce  out  of  local  dialects,  like  French  in  Quebec,  into  the  new global language of the Internet and World Wide Web-the language that Otis Redding and Tina Turner taught the world, the language of rock and roll, English. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  new  media  will  undercut  nationalism  by  creating  new  affinities that  supersede  geographic  boundaries.  They  will  appeal  to  widely dispersed audiences that form wherever educated persons happen to find themselves.  These  new  nonterritorial  affinities  will  flourish,  and  in  so doing  help  to  create  a  new  focus  for  ''patriotism.''  Or  rather,  they  will form  new  ''in-groups"  with  whom  individuals  can  identify  without necessarily sacrificing their economic rationality. The history of the Jews during the past two thousand years shows that this is possible over the long  term  and  in  the  face  of  hostile  local  conditions.  As  the  comment from  William  Pfaff  quoted  at  the  head  of  this  chapter  suggests,  it  is  a historical  and  wrong  to  think  that  loyalties  to  the  land  of  one's  fathers, the  patria,  necessarily  entails  loyalty  to  an  institution  resembling  a nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M. Smith make this even more clear in  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">General Crisis</i> <i class="calibre3">of the Seventeenth Century</i>, showing that what appear to be  examples  of  early  modern  nationalism  are  more  often  instances  of patriots  defending  a  much  narrower  patria-often  against  the encroachment of a state. They write, "All too often a supposed allegiance to  a  national  community  turns  out,  on  inspection,  to  be  nothing  of  the kind. The  <i class="calibre3">patria</i> itself is at least as likely to be a home town or province as the whole nation."34</p>

<p class="calibre1">212</p>

<p class="calibre1">342</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-344"></a>As  Jack  Weatherford  lucidly  explains  in   <i class="calibre3">Savages  and  Civilization</i>,  the rise  of  the  printing  press,  the  first  mass-production  technology,  had dramatic  effects  in  contributing  to  the  creation  of  politics,  with  its demands for allegiance to a broader nationstate. By the year 1500, there were printing presses operating in 236 places in Europe, "and they had printed a combined total of some 20 million books."35 Gutenberg's first printed  book  was  an  edition  of  the  Bible  in  Latin.  He  followed  it  with editions  of  other  popular  medieval  books  in  Latin.  As  Weatherford explains,  printing  meandered  in  a  direction  that  defeated  early expectations that the ready availability of texts would spread the use of Latin and even Greek. To the contrary. There were two important reasons why  the  printing  press  did  not  reinforce  the  use  of  Latin.  First,  the printing press was a mass-production technology. As Benedict Anderson points out, "[I]f manuscript knowledge was scarce and arcane lore, print knowledge  lived  by  reproducibility  and  dissemination."36  Very  few Europeans were multilingual in 1500. This meant that the audience for works  in  Latin  was  not  a  mass  audience.  The  vast  majority  who  were monoglot  made  up  a  much  bigger  market  of  potential  readers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  what  was  true  of  readers  was  even  more  true  of  writers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Publishers needed products to sell. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  there  were  few  contemporary  fifteenth-or  sixteenth-century authors who could compose satisfactory new works in Latin, publishers were  driven  by  market  necessity  to  publish  works  in  the  vernacular. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Printing thus helped to differentiate Europe into linguistic subsets. This was  encouraged  not  only  by  the  publication  of  new  works  that established  the  identity  of  new  languages,  like  Spanish  and  Italian,  but also  by  the  adoption  of  characteristic  typefaces,  such  as  Roman,  Italic, and the heavy Gothic script that was common to German publishing until well  into  the  twentieth  century.  The  new  vernacular  publishing,  what Anderson  describes  as  "print  capitalism,"  was  very  successful.  Most notably, the printing press gave heresy the kind of decisive boost that we expect  for  the  denationalization  of  the  individual  from  the  Internet.  In particular, Luther became "the first best-selling author so known. Or to put it another way, the first writer who could 'sell' his new books on the basis  of  his  name."37  Astonishingly,  Luther's  works  accounted  for  "no less than one third of all German-language books sold between 1518 and 1525."38</p>

<p class="calibre1">343</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-345"></a>In  many  respects,  the  new  technology  of  the  Information  Age  will counter part of the megapolitical impact of fifteenth-century technology, the  printing  press,  in  stimulating  and  underpinning  the  rise  of nationstates.  The  World  Wide  Web  creates  a  commercial  venue  with  a global  language,  English.  It  will  eventually  be  reinforced  with simultaneous-translation  software,  making  almost  everyone  effectively multilingual, and helping to denationalize language and imagination. Just as  the  technology  of  the  printing  press  undermined  allegiance  to  the dominant institution of the Middle Ages, the Holy Mother Church, so we expect  the  new  communications  technology  of  the  Information  Age  to undermine the authority of the nanny state. In due course, almost every area  will  become  multilingual.  Local  dialects  will  rise  in  importance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Propaganda  from  the  center  will  lose  much  of  its  coherence  as immigrants  and  speakers  of  minority  tongues  are  emboldened  to  resist assimilation into the nation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">213</p>

<p class="calibre1">344</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-346"></a><b class="calibre4">MILITARY MYSTICISM</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Far  from  being  objective  communities,  in  the  same  sense  that,  for example, "hunting-gathering bands" are objective, nations are imagined out of a mysticism inspired by a defunct military imperative, That was the  imperative  to  link  every  person  living  within  a  territory  through  a sense of identity that can be made to seem more important than life itself. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As Kantorowicz noted, it is not a coincidence that "at a certain moment in history the state in the abstract or the state as a corporation appeared as  a  corpus  mysticism  and  that  death  for  this  new  mystical  body appeared equal in value to the death of a crusader for the cause of God!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">39  In  this  sense,  the  nationstate  can  be  understood  as  a  mystical construct. Yet as Billig notes, nationalism is "a banal mysticism, which is so  banal  that  all  the  mysticism  seems  to  have  evaporated  long  ago."  It</p>

<p class="calibre1">"binds 'us' to the homeland-that special place which is more than just a place,  more  than  a  mere  geophysical  area.  In  all  this,  the  homeland  is made  to  look  homely,  beyond  question  and,  should  the  occasion  arise, worth  the  price  of  sacrifice.  And  men,  in  particular,  are  given  their special, pleasure-saturated reminders of the possibilities of sacrifice."40</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  imaginative  link  between  the  nation  and  home  continues  to  be highlighted by nationalists at every opportunity. As Billig suggests, the nation  is  ''imagined  as  homely  space,  cozy  within  its  borders,  secure against  the  dangerous  outside  world.  And  'we'  the  nation  within  the homeland can so easily imagine 'ourselves' as some sort of family." 41</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  cliches  of  nationalism,  tirelessly  and  routinely  repeated,  include many  commonplace  metaphors  of  kinship  and  identity.  They  associate the  nation  with  an  individual's  sense  of  "inclusive  fitness,"  a  powerful motive for altruism and sacrifice. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">'That  sacrificial  altruism  does  exist  in  social  insects,  other  nonhuman</i> <i class="calibre3">animals, and humans</i> <i class="calibre3">implies that maximization of self-interest cannot be</i> <i class="calibre3">solely  defined  in  terms  of  an  individual</i> <i class="calibre3">organism's  wants  and  needs. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Indeed, the presence of altruism, particularly toward kin, has</i> <i class="calibre3">required a</i> <i class="calibre3">whole  rethinking  of  traditional  notions  of  survival  of  the  fittest  in  the</i> <i class="calibre3">biological</i> <i class="calibre3">sciences.

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-348"></a><b class="calibre4">NATIONALISM AND INCLUSIVE FITNESS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Our main focus in this book is on objective "megapolitical" factors that alter  the  costs  and  rewards  of  human  choices.  The  underlying  premise upon which the predictive power of the analysis rests is that individuals will  seek  rewards  and  shun  costs.  This  is  an  essential  truth  of  what Charles Darwin called "the economy of nature." But it is not the whole truth.  Simple  reward  optimization  does  not  explain  everything  in  life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However,  it  does  illuminate  two  of  the  three  main  forms  of  human sociality,  identified  by  Pierre  Van  Den  Berghe  as  "reciprocity  and coercion."43  By  "reciprocity"  Van  Den  Berghe  means  "cooperation  for mutual  benefit."44  The  most  complex  and  far  reaching  examples  of reciprocity  are  market  interactions:  trading,  buying,  selling,  producing, and other economic activities. "Coercion is the use of force for one-sided benefit, that is, for purposes of intra-specific parasitism or predation."45</p>

<p class="calibre1">As we have explored in this 214</p>

<p class="calibre1">volume  and  two  previous  books,  we  believe  that  coercion  is  a  crucial element  in  human  society,  a  larger  one  than  is  usually  recognized. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Coercion helps determine the security of property and limits the ability of individuals to enter into mutually beneficial cooperation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Coercion  underlies  all  politics.  The  third  element  in  Van  Den  Berghe's typology of human sociality is "kin selection," the cooperative behavior that animals undertake with their kin. Kin selection, which is described more fully below, is also a crucial feature of the "economy of nature." </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Jack  Hirshleifer  has  written,  "[T]he  revival  of  Darwinian evolutionary selection theory as applied to problems of social behaviour, which  has  come  to  be  known  as  sociobiology,"  has  "a  distinctly economic  aspect."  And:  Looking  over  the  whole  realm  of  life, sociobiology  is  attempting  to  find  the  general  laws  determining  the multifarious forms of association among organisms. For example, Why do  we  sometimes  observe  sex  and  families,  sometimes  sex  without families,  sometimes  neither  sex  nor  families?  Why  do  some  animals flock,  others  remain  solitary?  Within  groups,  why  do  we  sometimes observe  hierarchical  dominance  patterns,  sometimes  not?  Why  do 347</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-349"></a>organisms  in  some  species  partition  territories,  others  not?  What determines the selflessness of the social insects, and why is this pattern so rare in Nature? When do we see resources allocated peacefully, when by means of violence? These are questions both posed and answered in recognizably  economic  terms.  Sociobiologists  ask  what  are  the  net advantages  of  the  observed  association  patterns  to  the  organisms displaying  them,  and  what  are  the  mechanisms  whereby  these  patterns persist  in  social  equilibrium  states.  It  is  perhaps  this  assertion  of economic-behavioural  continuity  between  man  and  other  life-forms (termed "genetic capitalism" by one detractor) that explains the hostility of some ideologues to sociobiology. ..... </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  introduce  sociobiology  into  our  analysis  of  nationalism  because  it provides  perspective  on  aspects  of  human  nature  that  help  facilitate systematic coercion. We agree with natural scientist Cohn Tudge, author of  <i class="calibre3">The  Time  Before  History</i>,  that  before  we  can  understand  the  current world,  much  less  gain  a  perspective  on  that  to  come,  we  need  to understand the preface to history. That means we must "look at ourselves on  the  grand  scale  of  time."47  Tudge  reminds  us  "that  beneath  the surface  tremors  of  our  lives  there  are  much  deeper  and  more  powerful forces at work that in the end affect us all and all our fellow creatures... </p>

<p class="calibre1">48 We suspect that among "these deeper and more powerful forces" is a genetically </p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, human nature, the origin of species, and their development by natural  selection  are  elements  to  be  considered  in  understanding  the continuing evolution of 215</p>

<p class="calibre1">348</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-350"></a>human society. In the present case we are considering the likely human response  to  new  circumstances  occasioned  by  information  technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Particularly,  we  are  focusing  on  the  reaction  to  the  advent  of  the cybereconomy  and  its  many  consequences,  including  the  emergence  of economic  inequality  more  pronounced  than  anything  seen  in  the  past. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Keys  to  at  least  some  of  the  expected  response  lie  in  our  genetic inheritance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  a  new  species  is  formed,  it  does  not  discard  all  the  DNA  that  it carried in its previous form, but adds to it. The whole difference between a human being and a chimpanzee is contained in less than 2 percent of the  DNA  in  each  species;  slightly  over  98  percent  of  their  DNA  is common  to  both,  and  some  of  it  can  be  traced  back  to  very  primitive early organisms, far down the historic chain of development. </p>

<p class="calibre1">349</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-351"></a><b class="calibre4">GENETIC INERTIA</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Human  cultures  similarly  contain  elements  that  are  universal,  some  of which are indeed inherited from prehuman ancestors. How we seek food, how we mate, how we form families, how we relate to strange groups, how  we  defend  ourselves  are  all  complex  mixtures  of  instinct  and culture,  with  very  primitive  roots.  They  are  also  all  capable  of  modern adaptations, such as those that have characterized the nationstate in the modern period. If we think of cultures in this way, we shall see them as parallel  to  genetic  development.  The  three  great  differences  are  that cultures are transmitted by the information chain between human beings, not by the genetic chain between generations; they can to some extent-perhaps  less  than  we  think  be  changed  by  conscious  intelligent  action; they change with the prevailing environment of costs and rewards, which mutates much faster than genetic change. Physically we are very similar to our ancestors of thirty thousand years ago; culturally we have moved quite far away from them. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Evolutionary Models</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">There are two biological models of the way in which species evolve. The scientific orthodoxy is neo-Darwinist. Random genetic changes produce different  physical  forms.  Most  of  these  forms  have  no  advantage  to survival, as for instance the albino blackbird, and these tend to die out. A small  number  of  them  are  helpful  to  survival  and  spread  through  the species.  There  are  still  many  difficulties  in  this  theory,  which  may  be sorted  out  by  scientists  in  the  next  century,  but  randomness  and  the survival of favorable adaptations are the current scientific orthodoxy and have  some  explanatory  power.  The  alternative  is  some  variant  of  the theory of the early twentieth century French philosopher Henri Bergson, who  believed  that  nature  had  some  nonrandom  creative  purpose,  an intelligent force seeking solutions. This concept has echoes in the work of  such  contemporary  authorities  as  David  Layzer  and  Stephen  Jay Gould, who have stressed that genetic variation is not simply random but shows definite propensities.50 This is not creationism in its strict biblical sense, but it avoids many of the problems of orthodox Darwinism. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">INFLUENCED</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  biological  perspective  on  human  behavior  was  enhanced  by  the introduction  of  the  concept  of  "inclusive  fitness"  in  1963  by  W  D. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hamilton  in  "The  Evolution  of  Altruistic  Behavior."  Hamilton recognized  that  while  humans  are  fundamentally  given  to  self-oriented behavior, they also undertake occasional acts of altruism or self-sacrifice that  offer  no  apparent  benefits  in  terms  of  the  life  of  the  individual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hamilton  sought  to  reconcile  these  apparent  contradictions  by  positing that the fundamental maximizing unit is not the individual organism but the  gene.  Individuals  in  any  species  will  seek  to  maximize  not  simply their  own  personal  wellbeing  but  what  Hamilton  called  their  "inclusive fitness."  He  argued  that  "inclusive  fitness"  involves  not  only  personal survival in the Darwinian sense, but also the enhanced reproduction and survival  of  close  relatives  who  share  the  same  genes.52  Hamilton's</p>

<p class="calibre1">"inclusive  fitness"  thesis  helps  illuminate  many  otherwise  curious features of human societies, including aspects of politics in nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Altruism: Misnomer or Fossil Kin Selection? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">According to Van Den Berghe, "Altruism, then, is directed mostly at kin, especially  at  close  kin,  and  is,  in  fact,  a  misnomer.  It  represents  the ultimate  genetic  selfishness.  It  is  but  the  blind  expression  of  inclusive fitness  maximization."  This  is  not  to  say,  however,  that  there  is  no altruism absent the close genetic relationship referred to by Hamilton and Van  Den  Berghe.  The  uncertainties  introduced  by  the  fact  that  humans reproduce sexually rather than through asexual cloning all but guarantee that an inclination to "inclusive fitness maximization" would stimulate a good deal of "altruism" </p>

<p class="calibre1">rebounding to the benefit of alleles other than the "selfish gene." In the first  instance,  there  is  always  the  possibility  that  some  persons  who undertake  helping  actions  may  do  so  in  the  mistaken  assumption  that they are helping close kin. The father who undertakes a sacrificial action for his offspring may not, in fact, be the progenitor but may merely think he is* This is .not merely a theme for soap operas, it is illustrative of a 352</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-354"></a>primordial  puzzle  that  survival  of  the  "selfish  genes"  is  probably facilitated if each apparent father behaves as if he actually is the father, even if there is a possibility that he is not. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Seen in their proper light, however, as Hirshleifer points out, many of the paradoxes of "altruism" are semantic muddles that frequently confuse or mislead people 217</p>

<p class="calibre1">into losing sight of the context of competition in which "helping" could convey a survival advantage: " 'If an altruism choice of strategy is to be viable in competition with non-altruism, altruism must contribute to self-survival  more  than  non-altruism  does,  and  therefore  it  can't  really  be altruism.'  All  such  muddles  could  be  avoided  if  we  drop  the  term</p>

<p class="calibre1">'altruism'  and  ask  instead:  What  are  the  determinants  of  the  entirely objective phenomenon that can be called helping? " 54 This question is perhaps  most  interesting  in  the  case  of  "kinship  helping."  Hamilton's basic formulation of inclusive fitness involved a biological cost-benefit analysis  in  which  an  individual,  or  "the  gene  controlling  helping behaviour," values the survival of an identical copy of itself equally to its own survival. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the willingness to undertake helping, let alone sacrifice, varies with  the  chance  that  another  individual  has  an  identical  gene. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Specifically,  a  gene  for  kinship  helping  instructs  a  man  (other  things equal)  to  give  his  life  if  he  can  thereby  save  two  siblings,  four  half-siblings, eight cousins, etc."55</p>

<p class="calibre1">*The same logic, of course, applies to thc son or daughter who sacrifices for those whom he takes to be his siblings but are not. </p>

<p class="calibre1">353</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-355"></a><b class="calibre4">PROBABILITY  PROBLEMS  OF  INCLUSIVE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">FITNESS</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">While this biologic seems clear in principle, upon closer examination it disguises  a  number  of  difficulties.  For  example,  the  fact  that  one's siblings  or  children  may  have  a  50  percent  probability  of  sharing  an identical gene does not, in strict logic, mean that it is actually expressed in  them.  Every  individual  carries  two  sets  of  each  gene,  one  from  the father and one from the mother. But this, of course, means that only half of  the  genes  carried  by  an  individual  parent  are  necessarily  present  in offspring.  Furthermore,  there  is  always  the  risk  of  mutation  in reproduction, which, unlikely though it may be, reduces the certainty of genetic cost-benefit analysis. So if the metaphor of "gene as optimizer" is taken seriously, the case of the pater who is not the progenitor is only the most clear-cut example of a broader problem. If it is indeed the survival of  the  "selfish  gene"  that  is  optimized  by  sacrificing  for  near-relatives, then  any  possibility  that  results  in  the  substitution  of  another  allele  for the identical copy of the "selfish gene" may be considered one of those intricate tricks that Mother Nature plays on herself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Uncertain Consequences</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Altruism  directed  toward  kin  therefore  involves  problems.  Not  only  is there  the  probability  problem  for  the  "selfish  gene"  that  apparent relatives of its host may not, in fact, share its identical copies. There is also  the  difficulty  of  determining  under  conditions  of  uncertainty whether  any  given  gesture  of  sacrifice  will,  in  fact,  primarily  benefit relatives rather than others. (Sacrifice that primarily benefits others may actually  harm  the  inclusive  fitness  of  the  selfish  gene  by  reducing  the prospects that it will be represented in succeeding populations.) Consider an awful example inspired by the news while we were writing. Suppose a parent in Dunblane, Scotland, learned on short notice 218</p>

<p class="calibre1">that an armed lunatic was heading into a local school with the apparent intention of doing harm. By acting instantly, he or she could undertake the  heroic  but  possibly  doomed  gesture  of  confronting  the  lunatic,  and thereby possibly save his or her children at the school. </p>

<p class="calibre1">354</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-356"></a>Or possibly not. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even a ruthless lunatic intent on killing every child on the planet would be limited in the harm he could do before running short of ammunition or being subdued by others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Had the sacrificing parent decided not to intervene, more likely than not his  children  would  have  survived  in  any  event,  as  most  children  at  the school  did.  All  the  harm  that  a  gallant  act  of  sacrifice  would  have prevented  probably  would  otherwise  have  fallen  on  the  children  of others. So by risking his or her life, primarily for the children of others, the  father  or  mother  in  question  might  actually  have  reduced  his</p>

<p class="calibre1">"inclusive fitness." By depriving all his children of one of their parents, he would probably have left those children in a worsened position in the Darwinian struggle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While this is admittedly a strained example, it is also realistic. It reflects the  fact  that  there  are  countless  circumstances  in  life  in  which  large  or small  acts  of  helping  have  beneficial  effects.  In  many  cases,  the  direct beneficiaries of such actions cannot be easily isolated to closely related kin.  And  ironically,  as  we  consider  below,  this  may  be  part  of  the survival benefit that enabled those with less discriminate helping genes to endure all the millennia of unpleasantness until now. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Altruism and Genetic Inertia</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">If, as we believe, the "selfish gene" thesis is an accurate approximation of what motivates human action, it would be too simple to suppose that the  helping  or  sacrificial  behavior  it  engenders  could  operate  narrowly and solely for the benefit of actual relatives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Imperfect knowledge makes distinguishing kin an uncertain art in some circumstances. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And  even  assuming  that  kin  were  known,  actual  representation  of  any given "selfish gene" in the population of kin could not be ascertained as more  than  a  matter  of  probabilities.  Until  recently,  it  would  have  been impossible to distinguish actual genetic markers among individuals. And we  are  still  some  distance  from  being  able  to  practically  distinguish 355</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-357"></a>which  near-relatives  actually  express  whatever  "selfish  gene"  is optimizing its survival. Beyond that is the greater difficulty of confining benefits to kin rather than others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, it is also obvious from experience that humans sometimes divert their "nurturing instincts" for the benefit of non-kin if appropriate kin are unavailable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  most  clear-cut  example  of  this  is  the  behavior  of  parents  toward adopted  children,  or  even  the  behavior  of  certain  persons,  usually childless,  toward  their  household  pets.  It  is  not  unheard  of  for  such individuals to court serious injury and even death to rescue cats trapped in  a  tree.  Certainly,  in  any  given  year,  a  not-insignificant  number  of persons  perish  in  household  accidents  precipitated  in  some  fashion  by pets who find their way into jeopardy. What is true of pets is more true of adoptive children. It is certainly not a 219</p>

<p class="calibre1">stretch  to  say  that  parents  of  adopted  children  often  treat  them  "as  if" </p>

<p class="calibre1">they  were  kin,  thus  giving  the  concept  of  "kin  selection"  another meaning. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  cases  do  not  discredit  the  "selfish  gene"  theory  as  much  as  some critics would wish. To the contrary. We see examples of people behaving</p>

<p class="calibre1">"as  if"  they  were  sacrificing  for  close  relatives  to  advance  their  own inclusive  fitness,  as  instances  of  "genetic  inertia."  In  other  words,  they reflect the fact, noted by Howard Margolis in Selfishness, Altruism and Rationality,  that  "human  society  changed  faster"  than  human  genetic makeup. People, therefore, continue to act "substantially as if living in a small hunter-gatherer group." 56 A crucial characteristic of such groups was, as Van Den Berghe put it, that They were small in-bred populations of a few hundred individuals . </p>

<p class="calibre1">Members  of  the  tribe,  though  subdivided  into  smaller  kin  groups,  saw themselves  as  a  single  people,  solitary  against  the  outside  world,  and interlinked by a web of kinship and marriage making the tribe in fact a superfamily.  A  high  rate  of  inbreeding  assured  that  most  spouses  were also kinsmen." 57</p>

<p class="calibre1">356</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-358"></a>In  short,  for  all  of  human  existence  prior  to  the  advent  of  agriculture, ethnic  groups  were  "inbreeding  superfamilies."  Given  this  past  identity between  the  family  and  the  in-group,  there  could  well  be  a  genetically influenced tendency to treat the in-group as kin. It is easy to imagine that such  behavior  could  have  had  survival  value  in  the  past  when  every member of the "inbreeding superfamily" was kin. As Margolis suggests, it  is  easy  to  imagine  that  for  "such  small  bands  of  hunter-gatherers, closely  related,  that  inclusive  selfishness  (aside  from  any  prospect  of reciprocity or vengeance) would alone support a measure of commitment to  group-interest.  One  can  then  argue  that  some  tendency  to  group-interested motivation survives as a kind of fossil kin-altruism. " 58</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  because  we  retain  the  genetic  makeup  of  hunter-gatherers, our behavior toward in-groups reflects the kind of "altruism" </p>

<p class="calibre1">that  would  be  expected  to  optimize  the  survival  success  of  in-groups comprised by "inbreeding superfamilies." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Presumably,  as  Margolis  speculates,  this  tendency  for  group-interested behavior, arising from "fossil kin-altruism" or genetic inertia, contributed to  the  survival  of  Homo  sapiens  "while  other  humanoid  species  went extinct." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Epigenesis</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">We see this "as if" behavior as a prime example of "epigenesis," or the tendency  of  genetically  influenced  motivational  factors  to  innately  bias humans to favor certain choices over others. In other words, the human mind is not a tabula rasa, or blank slate, but a hard drive with prewired circuits that make certain responses more readily learned and attractive than  others.  Thus  the  proposition  that  the  mind  is  disposed  to  think  in terms of an out-group that excites enmity or hostility and an in-group to which one feels great amity or loyalty usually reserved for kin.60</p>

<p class="calibre1">This epigenetic tendency to behave with an in-group as if it comprised close relatives creates a vulnerability to manipulation that has commonly been  exploited  by  nationalists  to  engender  sacrificial  support  for  the state. In that sense, it is not a 220</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Bogus Kinship</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Consider  the  strong  tendency  of  politicians  everywhere  to  describe  the state  in  terms  borrowed  from  kinship  The  nation  is  "our  fatherland"  or</p>

<p class="calibre1">"our  motherland."  Its  citizens  are  "we,"  "members  of  the  family,"  our</p>

<p class="calibre1">"brothers  and  sisters."  62  The  fact  that  states  as  culturally  different  as France,  China,  and  Egypt  employ  such  similes  is  not  a  rhetorical coincidence,  as  we  see  it,  but  a  prime  example  of  "epigenesis"  or  the tendency  of  genetically  influenced  motivational  factors  to  innately  bias humans to favor certain choices. </p>

<p class="calibre1">How does this epigenesis work? The identification mechanism employed to  harness  emotional  loyalty  to  the  nationstate  makes  use  of  various devices that would have been markers of kinship in the primitive past "to link the individual's inclusive fitness concerns" with the interests of the state.63  For  example,  Shaw  and  Wong  focus  on  five  identification devices  used  by  modern  nationstates  to  mobilize  their  populations against out-groups. These are:</p>

<p class="calibre1">1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">a common language</p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">a shared homeland</p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the belief of common descent64</p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  characteristics,  of  course,  would  have  distinguished  the  nucleus ethnic group in the primitive past. Much of the appeal of nationalism can be traced to the way that these identification devices have been adopted and  dressed  up  in  the  language  of  kinship,  as  illustrated  in  the  French soldiers' chant quoted above. Such mobilization devices, which refer to the state as the "fatherland" or the "motherland," are common worldwide because they work. Nationalism, Reaction, and the New Luddites 271</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Genetic Accounting</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  imaginary  character  of  these  kinship  links  as  far  as  the  state  is concerned is evidenced by the fact that they possess none of the degrees of variability that characterize actual kinship. Even in extended families, where  everyone  is  related,  not  everyone  is  related  to  the  same  degree. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Parents  and  siblings  are  the  closest  relations,  grandparents  and  cousins are less close, with distant, kissing cousins so remote that they are barely more likely than complete strangers to share any given gene in common. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Husbands and 221</p>

<p class="calibre1">wives generally are no longer closely related, as they tended to be in the Stone Age. In any event, all actual kinship is definable in mathematical terms as the "coefficient of relatedness," which Hamilton calculated as a measure of genetic overlap.65</p>

<p class="calibre1">By contrast, the national "family" is imagined to be totally and elastically coincident  with  the  state's  territorial  dimensions.  Nationality  extends uniformly,  like  a  liquid,  into  every  crevice  within  the  strictly  defined boundaries. Benedict Anderson writes, "In the modern conception, state sovereignty  is  fully,  flatly  and  evenly  operative  over  each  square centimeter of a legally demarcated territory." 66 And, of course, when it comes to sacrifice for the state, the coefficient of imaginary relatedness is always one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">359</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-361"></a>This identification of inclusive fitness with the nationstate is interesting because  it  could  help  inform  the  disposition  of  humans  to  welcome  or resist the changes of the new millennium. As we have explored earlier, prior to the Information Age all types of society were territorially based. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  either  formed  around  the  home  territory  of  the  nucleus  ethnic group, or, as with the nationstate, played upon the same motives of group solidarity  to  mobilize  force  for  defense  of  a  local  territory  against outsiders. In every case, it was the stranger outside of one's immediate territory  who  was  feared  as  the  enemy.  Given  the  assumptions  of  kin selection in the primordial past, this made sense. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  humanity  emerged  in  its  current  genetic  form,  members  of  the tribe were close kin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  were  members  of  a  nucleus  ethnic  group,  "the  inbreeding superfamily." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  there  really  was  a  practical  economic  reason,  given  the imperatives of kin selection, for the individual to identify the prosperity and  survival  of  immediate  kin  with  that  of  his  tribe,  or  superfamily.  A member  of  a  hunter-gatherer  tribe  really  did  depend  for  his  prosperity upon the success of the whole tribe. There was no independent property, nor any way that an individual or family could plausibly have hoped to survive and prosper if detached from the tribe. This strongly linked the individual's self-interest to that of the group. In Hirshleifer's words, "To the  extent  that  members  of  a  group  share  a  common  fate  or  outcome, helping one another becomes self-help." 67</p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  perhaps  a  mark  of  the  importance  of  epigenesis  in  informing attitudes  that  so  little  notice  has  been  taken  of  the  ironies  of  in-group identification  as  it  relates  to  the  modern  nationstate.  The  logic  of violence in the modern period tended to confound the very impulse that gave rise to the tendency to identify fitness with the in-group in the first place. Why? Because rather than facilitating the survival and prosperity of near-relatives in a hostile world, the identification of the individual's</p>

<p class="calibre1">"inclusive fitness" with a national in-group diluted the value of any act of sacrifice the individual might have made to the level of insignificance for his kin. The typical modern nationstate was simply too large to allow for a  statistically  significant  "coefficient  of  relatedness"  between  the individual  and  other  citizens  of  the  nation  that  laid  claim  to  him.  Not only  was  the  proportion  of  close  relatives  within  the  in-group  sharply diminished from almost unity in the Stone Age to a bare chemical trace in  the  twentieth  century;  the  "coefficient  of  relatedness"  between  the individual  citizen  and  the  rest  of  the  nation  would  not,  in  most  cases, have been significantly higher than with the whole human race. An In-group with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions (or in the case of the Chinese, more than a billion members) became so gigantic as to dilute the inclusive fitness effect of any sacrifice or benefit conveyed to 361</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-363"></a>the  scale  of  a  spit  in  the  ocean.  In  strict  logic,  therefore,  the  modern nationalist,  unlike  the  hunter-gatherer  of  the  Stone  Age,  could  not reasonably expect any gesture of sacrifice or helping for his "in-group" </p>

<p class="calibre1">to enhance the survival prospects for his family in a meaningful way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  national  economies  became  the fundamental  units  of  account  in  which  wellbeing  was  measured  in  the modern era, the largest obstacle to the talented individual's success, and therefore to that of his kin, became the burdens imposed in the name of the nation, the in-group itself This, at least, was true for those primarily engaged  in  reciprocal  rather  than  coercive  sociality-to  revisit  Van  Den Berghe's categories of human behavior. 68</p>

<p class="calibre1">The logic of the nationstate suggests that the ultimate price of citizenship is  sacrifice  and  death.  As  Jane  Bethke  Elshtain  observed,  nationstates indoctrinate citizens more for sacrifice than aggression: "The young man goes to war not so much to kill as to die, to forfeit his particular body for that of the large body, the body politic." 69 The impulse to sacrifice is no less  active  where  the  taxpayer  is  concerned.  Paying  taxes,  like  bearing arms, is a duty, rather than an exchange in which one forgoes money to obtain some product or service of an equal or greater value. This much is acknowledged  in  common  speech.  People  speak  of  a  "tax  burden"  as they do not speak of the "food burden" of shopping for nutriments, or the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"car  burden"  of  purchasing  an  automobile,  or  a  "vacation  burden"  for traveling,  precisely  because  commercial  purchases  are  generally  fair exchanges. Otherwise, the buyers would not make them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">223</p>

<p class="calibre1">In this respect, nationalism shows how epigenesis can reverse the logic of  the  Darwinian  "economy  of  nature."  The  nationstate  facilitated systematic,  territorially  based  predation.  Unlike  the  situation  faced  by hunter-gatherers in the Stone Age, the main parasite and predator upon the individual at the end of the twentieth century was not likely to be the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"outsider,"  the  foreign  enemy,  but  rather  the  presumed  embodiment  of the  "in-group,"  the  local  nationstate  itself.  Thus  the  main  advantage offered  by  the  advent  of  assets  that  transcend  territoriality  in  the Information  Age  is  precisely  the  fact  that  such  assets  can  be  placed beyond  the  reach  of  the  systematic  coercion  mobilized  by  the  local 362</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-364"></a>nationstate  in  whose  territory  the  would-be  Sovereign  Individual  was resident. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If our view is correct, microtechnology will make it technically feasible for  individuals  to  largely  escape  from  the  burdens  of  subordinate citizenship.  They  will  be  extranational  sovereigns  over  themselves,  not subjects,  in  the  new  "Virtual  City,"  owing  allegiance  by  contract  or private treaty in a fashion more reminiscent of premodern Europe, where merchants secured commercial treaties and charters to protect themselves</p>

<p class="calibre1">"from  arbitrary  seizures  of  property"  and  to  obtain  "exemption  from seigneurial  law."  In  the  cyberculture,  successful  persons  will  gain exemption  from  duties  of  citizenship  arising  from  an  accident  of  birth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They will no longer tend to think of themselves primarily as British or American. They will be extranational residents of the whole world who just happen to abide in one or more of its localities. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE CYBERECONOMY AND OUR GENETIC INHERITANCE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The hitch, however, is that this technological miracle and the economic miracle  it  implies-escaping  the  tyranny  of  place-depend  upon  the willingness of individuals to entrust much of their wealth and futures to strangers.  In  strict  genetic  accounting,  of  course,  those  strangers  would not  necessarily  be  less  genetically  close  than  most  of  our  "fellow citizens" upon whom in recent centuries we have been bound to depend. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The question is whether the perverse results of in-group amity in the case of  the  nationstate  are  negative  or  positive  indicators  for  the cybereconomy.  Will  the  "leftbehinds"  who  stand  to  lose  the  benefits  of coercive redistribution treat the death of the nationstate as if it were an attack on kin? The first quarter century of the new millennium will tell. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The emotional reactions could be complex. The fact that 115</p>

<p class="calibre1">million persons gave their lives fighting for nationstates in the twentieth century  is  stark  evidence  of  the  power  of  eplgenesls.71  It  shows  that many did consider the survival of their nations to be matters of life-and-death  importance.  The  question  is  whether  that  attitude  will  carry  over into a new age with different megapolitical imperatives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">363</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-365"></a>The fact that genetically influenced sacrifice on behalf of the nationstate often militated against the evolutionary purpose of kin selection also tells you that humans are adaptable enough to adjust to many circumstances for which we were not genetically programmed in the conditions of the Stone Age. As Tudge elaborates in describing the "extreme generalness" </p>

<p class="calibre1">of human beings: "We are the animal equivalent of the Turing machine: the universal device that can be turned to any task." 72 Which tendency will come to the surface in the coming transition crisis? Probably both. </p>

<p class="calibre1">224</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  commercialization  of  sovereignty  itself  depends  upon  the willingness of hundreds of thousands of Sovereign Individuals and many millions of others to deploy their assets in the "First Bank of Nowhere" </p>

<p class="calibre1">in  order  to  secure  immunity  from  direct  compulsion.  This  type  of  trust has no obvious analogue in the primordial past. There were few assets in the Stone Age. Those that did exist were hoarded under the control of a tribe, an "inbreeding superfamily" that was paranoid about outsiders. Yet notwithstanding the evolutionary novelty of the cybereconomy, it gives humans  the  chance  to  express  our  most  novel  genetic  inheritance-the intelligence that comes along with our outsized brains. Those among the information  elite  will  certainly  be  smart  enough  to  recognize  a  good thing when they see one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Further,  the  creation  of  assets  that  are  largely  immune  to  predation should  actually  rebound  in  a  practical  way  to  increase  the  "inclusive fitness" of Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While the economic logic of participating in the cybereconomy turns the rationales of the nationstate upside down, it is compelling, especially for persons of high skills. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  optimize  their  advantage  in  shopping  among  jurisdictions, individuals  must  be  willing  to  exit  the  nationstate  and  entrust  their personal  protection  to  security  personnel  motivated  mainly  by  market incentives in areas that may be distant from where they were born and reared.  This  implies  a  significant  advantage  in  being  multilingual  and cosmopolitan in culture rather than jingoistic. And it further implies that anyone  who  is  serious  about  realizing  the  liberating  potential  of  the 364</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-366"></a>cybereconomy  for  himself  and  his  family  should  begin  to  stake  out  a welcome for himself in several jurisdictions other than that in which he has  resided  during  his  main  business  career.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">73 </i>--CHRISTOPHER LASCH</p>

<p class="calibre1">225</p>

<p class="calibre1">365</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-367"></a><b class="calibre4">ESCAPE FROM THE NATIONSTATE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding the firm grip the nationstate as the "in-group" has had on  the  modern  imagination,  able  people  who  do  not  already  doubt  the utility  of  affiliating  with  a  grossly  expensive  "imagined  community" </p>

<p class="calibre1">soon will. In-deed, the partisans of the nationstate have already begun to complain of the growing detachment of the cognitive elites. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The late Christopher Lasch, in his diatribe  <i class="calibre3">The Revolt of the Elites and</i> <i class="calibre3">the Betrayal of</i> <i class="calibre3">Democracy</i>, assails those "whose livelihoods rest not so much  on  the  ownership  of  property  as  on  the  manipulation  of information."  74  Lasch  laments  the  extranational  character  of  the emerging information economy. He writes: the markets in which the new elites  operate  is  now  international  in  scope.  Their  fortunes  are  tied  to enterprises  that  operate  across  national  boundaries.  They  are  more concerned  with  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  system  as  a  whole  than with any of its parts. Their loyalties-if the term is not itself anachronistic in  this  context-are  international  rather  than  regional,  national  or  local. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They have more in common with their counterparts in Brussels or Hong Kong  than  with  the  masses  of  Americans  not  yet  plugged  into  the network of global communications. 75</p>

<p class="calibre1">Although Lasch was far from a dispassionate observer, and he obviously meant his portrait of the information elite to be unflattering, his contempt for  those  who  are  liberated  from  the  tyranny  of  place  rests  on  a perception of some of the same developments that are the focus of this book.  When  we  read  Lasch's  critiques  or  those  of  Mickey  Kaus  (   <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">End of Equality</i>), Michael Walzer (  <i class="calibre3">Spheres of Justice</i>), or Robert Reich (</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The  Work  of  Nations</i>),  we  see  parts  of  our  analysis  confirmed,  often unhappily,  by  authors  who  are  deeply  unsympathetic  to  many  of  the consequences  of  the  deepening  of  markets,  much  less  the denationalization  of  Sovereign  Individuals.  Lasch  lambastes  those  with extranational  ambitions  "who  covet  membership  in  the  new  aristocracy of  brains"  for  "cultivating  ties  with  the  international  market  in  fast-moving money, glamour, fashion and popular culture." He continues: It is  a  question  whether  they  think  of  themselves  as  Americans  at  all. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Patriotism,  certainly,  does  not  rank  very  high  in  their  hierarchy  of 366</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-368"></a>virtues. "Multiculturalism," on the other hand, Suits them to perfection, conjuring  up  the  agreeable  image  of  a  global  bazaar  in  which  exotic cuisines, exotic styles of dress, exotic music, exotic tribal customs can be savored indiscriminately, with no questions asked and no commitments required. The new elites are at home only in transit, en route to a high-level  conference,  to  the  grand  opening  of  a  new  franchise,  to  an international film festival or an undiscovered resort. Theirs is essentially a  tourist's  view  of  the  world-not  a  perspective  likely  to  encourage  a passionate devotion to democracy.76</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Economic Nationalism</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lurking  behind  criticisms  of  the  "transients"  who  make  up  the  virtual communities of the Information Age is a recognition that for many in the elite  the  benefits  of  transience  already  exceed  their  costs.  Critics  like Lasch  and  Walzer  do  not  dispute  that  clearheaded  cost-benefit  analysis makes  citizenship  obsolete  for  persons  of  high  skills.  They  do  not propose that those among the information elite whose attitudes 226</p>

<p class="calibre1">they  despise  have  miscalculated  where  their  best  interests  lie.  Nor  do they  pretend  that  the  compound-interest  tables  really  show  that continuing to pump one's money into a national social security program, much less income taxes, produces a better return than private investment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To the contrary, they understand arithmetic. They have seen the sums to their  obvious  conclusions.  But  rather  than  acknowledge  the  subversive logic  of  economic  rationality,  they  recoil  from  it,  counting  it  as</p>

<p class="calibre1">"betrayal" for the information elite to transcend the tyranny of place and abandon "the unenlightened."77</p>

<p class="calibre1">Like Pat Buchanan, the social democrats are economic nationalists who resent  the  triumph  of  markets  over  politics.  They  denounce  "the  new aristocracy  of  brains"  for  being  detached  from  place  and  not  caring passionately  about  their  view  of  where  the  best  interests  of  the  masses lie.  While  they  do  not  explicitly  recognize  the  denationalization  of  the individual  as  such,  they  rail  against  its  early  hints  and  manifestations, what  Walzer  describes  as  "the  imperialism  of  the  market,"  or  the tendency  of  money  to  "seep  across  boundaries"  in  order  to  buy  things which, as Lasch elaborates, "should not be for sale," </p>

<p class="calibre1">367</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-369"></a>such as exemption from military service. 78 Note the reactionary harking to the military demands of the nationstate as a sacred ground upon which money and markets should not trespass. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These criticisms of the information elite anticipate the terms of a popular reaction against the rise of Sovereign Individuals in the next millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  new,  more  market-driven  forms  of  protection  become  available,  it will  become  increasingly  evident  to  the  large  numbers  of  able  persons that most of the supposed benefits of nationality are imaginary. This will lead not only to better accounting of the opportunity costs of citizenship, it  will  also  create  new  ways  of  framing  allegedly  "political"  and  even</p>

<p class="calibre1">"economic"  questions.  For  the  first  time,  "an  individual  entrepreneur acting for and by himself" will be able to vary his own protection costs by moving between jurisdictions, without waiting for them to be effected by  "group  decision  and  group  action,"  to  quote  Frederic  C.  Lane's formulation of an old dilemma. 79</p>

<p class="calibre1">As  the  price  paid  for  protection  becomes  subject  "to  the  principle  of substitution," </p>

<p class="calibre1">this  will  lay  bare  the  arithmetic  of  compulsion,  intensifying  conflict between  the  new  cosmopolitan  elite  of  the  Information  Age  and  "the information  poor,"  the  remainder  of  the  population  who  are  largely monoglot and do not excel in problem-solving or possess some globally marketable skill. These "losers" or "leftbehinds," as Thomas L. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Friedman  describes  them,  will  no  doubt  continue  to  identify  their wellbeing with the political life of existing nationstates. 80</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">MOST POLITICAL AGENDAS WILL BE REACTIONARY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Most of those who harbor an ardent political agenda, whether nationalist, environmentalist,  or  socialist,  will  rally  to  defend  the  wobbling nationstate as the twenty-first century opens. Over time, it will become ever  more  obvious  that  survival  of  the  nationstate  and  the  nationalist sensibility  are  preconditions  for  preserving  a  realm  for  political compulsion.  As  Billig  points  out,  nationalism  "is  the  condition  for conventional  (political)  strategies,  whatever  the  particular  politics."  81</p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the nationalist 227</p>

<p class="calibre1">368</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-370"></a>content in all political programs will swell like a glutton's paunch in the years ahead. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Environmentalists,  for  example,  will  focus  less  on  protecting  "Mother Earth" and more on protecting the "motherland." For reasons we explore later,  the  nation  and  citizenship  will  be  especially  sacred  to  those  who value  equality  highly.  More  than  they  may  now  understand,  they  will come to agree with Christopher Lasch, who followed Hannah Arendt in proclaiming,  "It  is  citizenship  that  confers  equality,  not  equality  that creates a right to citizenship." 82</p>

<p class="calibre1">The privatization of sovereignty will deflate the industrial-era premium on equality by severing ties of the creators of wealth to nation and place. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Citizenship  will  no  longer  serve  as  a  mechanism  for  enforcing  income redistribution  based  upon  the  equality  of  the  vote  within  a  confined territory.  The  consequences  will  include  another  bruising  for  the progressive view of history. Contrary to the expectations of supposedly forward-thinking  people  when  the  twentieth  century  opened,  the  free market  was  not  destroyed  by  the  decades  but  left  triumphant.  The Marxists anticipated the eclipse of capitalism, which never happened, to lead  to  the  transcendence  of  nationstates  and  the  emergence  of  a universal  class  consciousness  among  workers.  In  fact,  the  state  will  be eclipsed,  but  in  a  very  different  way.  Something  nearly  the  opposite  to their expectation is happening. The triumph of capitalism will lead to the emergence  of  a  new  global,  or  extranational,  consciousness  among  the capitalists, many of whom will become Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Far  from  depending  upon  the  state  to  discipline  the  workers,  as  the Marxists  imagined,  the  ablest,  wealthiest  persons  were  net  losers  from the actions of the nationstate. It is clearly they who have the most to gain by transcending nationalism as markets triumph over compulsion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  not  immediately,  but  soon,  certainly  within  the  span  of  a generation,  almost  everyone  among  the  information  elite  will  elect  to domicile his income-earning activities in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  the  Information  Age  transforms  the  globe,  it  will  impress  an unmistakable object lesson in compound interest. Within years, let alone decades, it will be widely understood that almost anyone of talent could accumulate  a  much  higher  net  worth  and  enjoy  a  better  life  by 369</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-371"></a>abandoning  high-tax  nationstates.  We  have  already  hinted  at  the staggering  costs  that  the  leading  nationstates  impose,  but  as  this  is  the crux  of  an  issue  that  is  little  understood,  it  is  worth  reemphasizing  the opportunity costs of nationality. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Opportunity Costs</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Far from suffering from the loss or curtailment of government services currently financed by high taxes, the information elite will flourish in an unparalleled fashion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Simply by escaping the excess tax burden they now pay, they will gain a tremendous  margin  for  improving  the  material  wellbeing  of  their families.  As  previously  indicated,  each  $5,000  in  tax  paid  annually reduces  your  lifetime  net  worth  by  $2.4  million  if  you  can  earn  10</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent  annually  from  your  investments.  But  if  you  could  earn  20</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent,  each  $5,000  in  annual  tax  payments  would  leave  you  $44</p>

<p class="calibre1">million poorer over a period of forty years. Cumulatively, paying $5,000</p>

<p class="calibre1">per year would therefore cost you more than a 228</p>

<p class="calibre1">million  dollars  per  year.  At  that  rate,  $250,000  per  year  in  tax  would soon translate to an annual loss of more than $50 million, or $2.2 billion in a lifetime. And, of course, sporadically higher earnings, for even a few years, especially early in life, imply a still more startling loss of wealth to predatory taxation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Your  authors  have  seen  to  our  own  satisfaction  that  higher  than  20</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent  returns  are  possible.  Our  colleagues  at  Lines  Overseas Management  in  Bermuda  earned  triple-digit  returns,  averaging  226</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent  per  annum,  during  the  years  when  we  were  writing  this  book. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  experience  underscores  what  the  spreadsheet  suggests,  that  for many  high-income  earners  and  owners  of  capital,  predatory  taxation imposes a lifetime cost equivalent to a large fortune. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An  individual  with  high  earnings  capacity  paying  taxes  at  Hong  Kong rates could end up with a thousand times more wealth than someone with the  same  pretax  performance  paying  taxes  at  North  American  or European rates. To subject your capital to recurring invasion by a high-tax jurisdiction is like running in a race and having someone shoot you 370</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-372"></a>every time you take a stride. If you could enter the same race with proper protection  and  run  unhobbled,  you  would  obviously  go  much  farther, more quickly. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  Sovereign  Individuals  of  the  future  will  take  advantage  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"transient" </p>

<p class="calibre1">inclinations  that  so  offend  Christopher  Lasch  and  other  critics  of  the information elite, and they will shop for the most profitable jurisdictions in which to domicile. While this is contrary to the logic of nationalism, it accords with a compelling economic logic. A 10</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent,  let  alone  a  tenfold,  bottom-line  difference  will  frequently motivate  profit-maximizing  individuals  to  alter  their  lifestyles  and production  techniques,  as  well  as  their  place  of  abode.  The  history  of Western  civilization  is  a  record  of  restless  change  in  which  people  and prosperity  have  repeatedly  migrated  to  new  areas  of  opportunity  under the  spur  of  meandering  megapolitical  conditions.  A  thousandfold difference in bottom-line returns would match the most potent stimulus that  has  ever  put  rational  people  in  motion.  Or  put  another  way,  most people,  particularly  those  Thomas  L.  Friedman  calls  the  "losers  and leftbehinds,"  if  given  a  chance,  would  gladly  leave  any  nationstate  for $50 million, not to mention the still greater costs that nationstates impose in  tax  extracted  from  the  top  1  percent  of  taxpayers.  The  rise  of Sovereign  Individuals  shopping  for  jurisdictions  is  therefore  one  of  the surest forecasts one can make. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Seen in cost-benefit terms, citizenship was already a dreadful bargain as the  twentieth  century  drew  to  a  close.  This  was  highlighted  by  an unconsciously funny Parliamentary Research Note entitled "Is the Queen an  Australian  Citizen?"  produced  by  Ian  Ireland  of  the  Australian Parliamentary Research Service in August 1995.83 Ireland canvasses the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948, reviewing the four means by which one can obtain Australian citizenship. These are similar to the options for citizenship in other leading nationstates, namely: citizenship by birth 229</p>

<p class="calibre1">citizenship by adoption</p>

<p class="calibre1">citizenship by descent</p>

<p class="calibre1">citizenship by grant</p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  all  unremarkable  except  that  it  focuses  attention  upon  the distinction between sovereignty and citizenship. As Ireland says, "Under traditional legal and political concepts, the monarch is sovereign and the people  are  his/her  subjects.  Subjects  are  bound  to  the  monarch  by allegiance and subjection." Noting the obvious fact that Queen Elizabeth II is sovereign, he concludes that "there is an argument that the Queen is not an Australian citizen." 84</p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  she  is  not.  The  Queen,  long  may  she  live,  is  fortunate  to  be beyond caring about being a citizen. She is sovereign, the Sovereign over her subjects. Like a handful of other monarchs in the world, the Queen is sovereign by birth, having inherited her status as a matter of custom that predates modern times. The idea of monarchy is ancient, going back to the  earliest  historic  records  of  human  life.  Those  countries  that  have retained  their  monarchy  owe  their  constitution  to  their  ancient  history, but  it  still  helps  to  decide  the  shape  of  their  society,  in  terms  of  class prestige if not of political power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">372</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-374"></a>Postmodern individuals, without the Queen's head start, will be obliged to  invent  new  legal  rationales  upon  which  to  base  the  de  facto sovereignty that information technology will hand them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sovereign  Individuals  will  also  have  to  cope  with  the  corrosive consequences of envy-a difficulty that sometimes detains monarchs, but which  will  be  more  intensely  felt  by  persons  who  are  not  traditionally venerated but invent their own sovereignty. As Helmut Schoeck wrote in his  comprehensive  survey,  Envy,  "Where  there  is  only  one  king,  one president  of  the  United  States-in  other  words,  one  member  only  of  a particular status-he can live with relative impunity the kind of life which, even  on  a  much  smaller  scale,  would  arouse  indignation  in  the  same society  were  it  to  be  adopted  by  successful  members  of  larger professional  or  social  groups."  85  Monarchs,  as  embodiments  of  the nation,  enjoy  a  certain  immunity  to  envy  that  will  not  carry  over  to Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The "losers and leftbehinds" in the Information Society will surely envy and resent the success of winners, especially as the deepening of markets implies  that  this  will  be  increasingly  a  "winners  take  all"  world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Increasingly,  rewards  are  already  coming  to  be  based  upon  relative performance,  rather  than  absolute  performance  as  was  the  case  in industrial  production.  A  factory  worker  was  paid  either  on  the  basis  of hours in attendance as measured by the time clock, or according to some criterion  of  output,  such  as  pieces  made,  units  assembled,  or  some similar measure. 86 Standardized pay was made possible by the fact that output was similar for everyone using the same tools. But the creation of conceptual wealth, like artistic performance, varies dramatically among persons using the same tools. In this respect, the whole of the economy is becoming increasingly like opera, where the highest rewards go to those with the best voices, and those who sing out of tune, however earnestly, do not normally attract large rewards. As many fields are opened to truly global competition, the return for ordinary performance is bound to fall. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Middle talents will be in vast supply, some originating with persons who can rent their time for a fraction of the rates that prevail in the leading industrial countries. The losers will be the minor-league outfielders with</p>

Instead of  making  a  million  dollars  a  year  banging  out  home  runs,  they  will make  $25,000,  with  no  supplementary  income  from  celebrity endorsements. Others will strike out altogether. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Once a country opens itself up to the global market those of its citizens</i> <i class="calibre3">with  the  skills  to  take</i> <i class="calibre3">advantage  of  it  become  the  winners,  and  those</i> <i class="calibre3">without become losers or leftbehinds.

FRIEDMAN</p>

<p class="calibre1">Who will the losers be in the Information Age? In general terms, the tax consumers will be losers. It is usually they who could not increase their wealth by moving to another jurisdiction. Much of their income is lodged in  the  rules  of  a  national  political  jurisdiction  rather  than  conveyed  by market  valuations.  Therefore,  eliminating  or  sharply  reducing  the  taxes that are negatively compounding against their net worths may not appear to make them much better off-the price of lower taxation is a diminished stream of transfer payments. They will lose income because they will no longer be able to depend upon political compulsion to pick the pockets of persons  more  productive  than  themselves.  Those  without  savings  who rely upon government to pay their retirement benefits and medical care will in all probability suffer a fall in living standards. This loss of income translates  into  a  depreciation  of  what  financial  writer  Scott  Burns  has dubbed "transcendental" or political capital. 88 This "transcendental" or imaginary  capital  is  based  not  upon  the  economic  ownership  of  assets but upon the de facto claim to the income stream established by political rules  and  regulations.  For  example,  the  expected  income  from government transfer programs could be converted into a bond capitalized at prevailing interest rates. This imaginary bond funded by the imagined community is transcendental capital. It will be suddenly depreciated by the "great transformation" that is destined to reduce the grip of political authorities upon the cash flow required to redeem their promises. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  does  not  take  a  giant  stretch  of  the  imagination  to  see  that  the information  elite  are  likely  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  for liberation  and  personal  sovereignty  offered  by  the  new  cybereconomy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Equally, it is to be expected that the "leftbehinds" </p>

<p class="calibre1">will  become  increasingly  jingoistic  and  unpleasant  as  the  impact  of information  technology  grows  in  the  new  millennium.  It  is  difficult  to guess at precisely what point the reaction will turn ugly. Our guess is that the  recriminations  will  intensify  when  Western  nations  begin  to unambiguously crack apart in the manner of the former Soviet Union. </p>

<p class="calibre1">231</p>

<p class="calibre1">Equally,  every  time  a  nationstate  cracks  up,  it  will  facilitate  further devolution  and  encourage  the  autonomy  of  Sovereign  Individuals.  We expect to see a significant multiplication of sovereign entities, as scores of  enclaves  and  jurisdictions  more  akin  to  city-states  emerge  from  the rubble  of  nations.  These  new  entities  will  include  many  that  will  offer highly competitive pricing of protection services, imposing low taxes or none at all on income and capital. The new entities are almost bound to price  their  protection  services  more  attractively  than  do  the  leading OECD nationstates. Seen simply as a matter of market segmentation, the area of the market that is most poorly served is the high-efficiency, low-cost  end.  Anyone  who  wishes  to  pay  high  taxes  in  exchange  for  a complicated  array  of  state  spending  has  ample  opportunity  to  do  so. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  most  advantageous  and  profitable  strategy  for  a  new minisovereignty is almost bound to lie with a high-efficiency, low-price alternative.  Such  a  minisovereignty  could  only  with  great  difficulty expect to provide a more complete array of services than those on offer from the surviving nationstates. Since all nationstates will certainly not collapse  at  once,  the  statist  alternative  is  likely  to  be  well  supplied, especially early in the transition. </p>

<p class="calibre1">375</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-377"></a>On the other hand, a no-frills regime of tolerable law and order can be provided relatively cheaply. If social unrest and crime spread in the old core industrial countries to the degree that we expect, tolerable law and order will be far more appealing in a jurisdiction than a national space program,  a  state-sponsored  women's  museum,  or  subsidized  retraining schemes for displaced executives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Citizenship  will  become  less  attractive  and  tenable  as  new  institutions emerge  to  facilitate  choice  in  the  services  governments  now  engross, beginning with protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This will make it practical for individuals to cease to identify themselves in  national  terms.  Yet  the  demystification  of  citizenship  will  be  a  slow process.  You  are  constantly  exposed  to  a  barrage  of  banal  messages  in the  routines  of  daily  life  designed  to  reinforce  your  identification  with your local nationstate. These messages make it highly unlikely for you to forget "your nationality." For many people, nationality is a crucial badge of identity. "We" are taught to see the world in terms of nationality. It is our country, "our" </p>

<p class="calibre1">athletes  compete  in  the  Olympics.  When  they  win,  it  is  "our"  flag  that waves  in  the  ceremony.

"We" are led to believe that  it  is  "our"  victory,  although  it  is  never  quite  clear  how  "we" </p>

<p class="calibre1">participated, other than by being within the same territory as a citizen. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">From First Person Plural to Singular</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  information  technology  comes  to  the  fore,  it  will  help  facilitate  a global  perspective,  as  well  as  create  ways  by  which  Sovereign Individuals can harness the latent possibilities of information technology to escape from the nationalist burden of taxation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Within  the  next  few  decades,  for  example,  narrow-casting  will  replace broadcasting as 232</p>

<p class="calibre1">the method by which individuals obtain their news. This has significant implications. It amounts to a change in the imaginations of millions from first personal plural to singular. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  individuals  themselves  begin  to  serve  as  their  own  news  editors, selecting what topics and news stories are of interest, it is far less likely 377</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-379"></a>that  they  will  choose  to  indoctrinate  themselves  in  the  urgencies  of sacrifice  for  the  nationstate.  Much  the  same  effect  will  arise  from  the privatization  of  education,  again  facilitated  by  technology.  In  the medieval period, education was firmly under the control of the Church. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the modern age, education has been under the control of the state. In the words of Eric Hobsbawm, "state education transformed people into citizens  of  a  specific  country:  'peasants  into  Frenchmen.'  "  90  In  the Information Age, education will be privatized and individualized. It will no  longer  be  lumbered  with  the  heavy  political  baggage  that characterized education during the industrial period. Nationalism will not be constantly massaged into every corner of the mind's life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The move to the Internet and the World Wide Web will also reduce the importance of location in commerce. It will create individual addresses that  are  not  bounded  territorially.  Satellite-based  digital  telephone services  will  evolve  beyond  location-based  land-line  systems  sharing  a common  international  dialing  code.  The  individual  will  have  his  own, unique global telephone address, like an Internet address, that will reach him  wherever  he  happens  to  be.  In  due  course,  national  postal monopolies  will  collapse,  allowing  privatized  mail  delivery  by worldwide services with no particular ties to any existing nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  and  other  apparently  small  steps  will  help  free  the  ordinary consumer, as well as the cognitive elite, from rote identification with the nationstate. The demystification of citizenship will be most dramatically accelerated by the emergence of practical alternatives to dealing within bounded  territories  monopolized  by  states.  The  building  blocks  of  the cybereconomy-cybermoney,  cyberbanking,  and  an  unregulated  global cybermarket in securities-are almost bound to come into existence on a large scale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As they do, the capacity of greedy governments to confiscate the wealth of "citizens" will shrivel. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While  the  leading  states  will  no  doubt  attempt  to  enforce  a  cartel  to preserve  high  taxes  and  fiat  money  by  cooperating  to  limit  encryption and  prevent  citizens  from  escaping  their  domains,  the  states  will ultimately fail. The most productive people on the planet will find their way  to  economic  freedom.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  state  will  even  be 378</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-380"></a>effective at keeping people penned up where they can be physically held to  ransom.  The  ineffectiveness  of  efforts  to  bar  illegal  immigrants convincingly shows that nationstates will be unable to seal their borders to prevent successful people from escaping. The rich will be at least as enterprising  in  getting  out  as  would-be  taxi  drivers  and  waiters  are  at getting in. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  time  since  the  medieval  period  of  fragmented  sovereignty, borders will not be clearly demarcated. As we explored earlier, there will be no distinct territory in which many future financial transactions will occur. Instead of accepting an inheritance of liabilities on the basis of an accident of birth, increasing numbers of Sovereign Individuals will take advantage of this ambiguity to desert their tax liabilities, moving beyond citizenship to become customers. They will negotiate private tax treaties 233</p>

<p class="calibre1">as customers, along the lines now available in Switzerland, as analyzed in  Chapter  8.  A  typical  private  tax  treaty  negotiated  with  the  French-speaking  Swiss  cantons  allows  an  individual  or  family  to  reside  in exchange  for  a  fixed  annual  tax  payment  of  50,000  Swiss  francs (currently about $45,000). Note that this is not a flat-rate tax, but a fiat amount of tax fixed without respect to income. If your annual income is 50,000 Swiss francs, ($45,000) you should not enter into such a private tax treaty because your tax rate would be 100 percent. At an income of 500,000 Swiss francs, your rate is 10 percent. At SF5,000,000, the rate is just 1 percent. At SF50 million, your tax rate is just 1/10th of percent. If this  seems  an  incredibly  good  deal  compared  to  a  marginal  rate  of  58</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent in New York City, that is merely a measure of how predatory and monopolistic  the  pricing  of  government  services  generally  became during the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  50,000  Swiss  francs  is  an  ample  annual  payment  for  the necessary and useful services of government. The Swiss surely make a large profit from serving every millionaire who moves in and pays them 50,000 Swiss francs annually for the privilege. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  many  cases,  the  government's  marginal  cost  to  have  another millionaire living in the jurisdiction is approximately zero. Therefore, its annual profit on the transaction will approach 50,000 Swiss francs. Any 379</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-381"></a>service  that  can  be  undercut  and  still  allow  the  low-cost  provider approximately a 100 percent profit is monopolized and overpriced to an extreme.  What  is  remarkable  is  not  that  the  rate  of  tax  charged  should fall as a percentage of income in this particular case, but that it should ever have seemed "fair" </p>

<p class="calibre1">that  different  persons  should  pay  wildly  different  amounts  for  the services of government during the twentieth century. This is particularly odd  in  that  those  who  use  government  services  the  most  pay  the  least, and those who use them least pay the most. All of them will provide an advantage  as  a  domicile  over  the  United  States  worth  tens  of  millions over  a  lifetime  to  any  high-income  American.  Unless  U.S.  taxes  are reformed to become more competitive with those of other jurisdictions, and are no longer levied on the basis of nationality, thinking pers9ns will renounce  U.S.  citizenship,  notwithstanding  the  obstacles  imposed  by Clinton's exit tax, to take up passports that entail less onerous liabilities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments in the industrial era priced their services on the basis of the success of the taxpayer, rather than in relation to the costs or value of any services provided. The movement to commercial pricing of government service will lead to more satisfactory protection at a far lower price than that imposed by conventional nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Citizenship Goes the Way of Chivalry</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, citizenship is destined to go the way of chivalry. As the basis upon  which  protection  is  provided  is  reorganized  once  again,  the rationalizations  and  motivating  ideologies  that  complement  the  system will  also  inevitably  change.  Half  a  millennium  ago,  at  the  close  of  the Middle  Ages,  when  the  provision  of  protection  in  return  for  personal service generally ceased to be a paying proposition, people responded in the predictable way. They abandoned chivalry. Sworn oaths and personal fealty ceased to be taken as seriously as they had been for the previous five centuries. Now 234</p>

<p class="calibre1">information technology promises to be equally subversive of citizenship. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The nationstate and the claims of nationalism will be demystified just as the claims of the monopoly Church were demystified five centuries ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">380</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-382"></a>While reactionaries will respond by attempting to vilify innovators and revive  nationalist  sentiment,  we  doubt  that  the  megapolitically  defunct nationstate can exert a sufficiently strong tug of loyalties to withstand the Competitive  pressures  unleashed  by  information  technology.  Most thinking individuals in a world of bankrupt governments will prefer to be well treated as customers of protection services, rather than be plundered as citizens of nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The wealthy OECD countries impose heavy tax and regulatory burdens upon  individuals  doing  business  within  their  borders.  These  costs  may have  been  tolerable  when  the  OECD  nationstates  were  the  only jurisdictions in which one could do business and reside at a reasonable level of comfort. That day has passed. The premium paid to be taxed and regulated  as  a  resident  of  the  richest  nationstates  no  longer  repays  its cost. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  will  be  ever  less  tolerable  as  competition  between  jurisdictions intensifies.  Those  with  the  earnings  ability  and  capital  to  meet  the competitive  challenges  of  the  Information  Age  will  be  able  to  locate anywhere  and  do  business  anywhere.  With  a  choice  of  domiciles,  only the most patriotic or stupid will continue to reside in high-tax countries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  this  reason,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  one  or  more  nationstates  will undertake covert action to subvert the appeal of transience. Travel could be effectively discouraged by biological warfare, such as the outbreak of a deadly epidemic. This could not only discourage the desire to travel, it could also give jurisdictions throughout the globe an excuse to seal their borders and limit immigration. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Drawback of Nationality Taxation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Unless there is an astonishing and almost miraculous change in policies, the successful investor or entrepreneur in the Information Age will pay a lifetime penalty of tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or even billions of  dollars  to  reside  in  the  countries  with  fiscal  policies  like  those  that have enjoyed the highest living standards during the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Absent a radical change, the penalty will be highest for Americans. The United States is one of just three jurisdictions on the planet that impose 381</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-383"></a>taxes based upon nationality rather than residence. The other two are the Philippines, a former U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">colony,  and  Eritrea,  one  of  whose  exiled  leaders  fell  under  the  spell  of the  IRS  during  its  long  rebellion  against  Ethiopian  rule.  Eritrea  now imposes a nationality tax of 3 percent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While that is a pale imitation of the U.S. rates, even that burden makes Eritrean citizenship a liability in the Information Age. Current law makes U.S.  citizenship  even  a  larger  liability.  The  IRS  has  become  one  of America's  leading  exports.  More  than  any  other  country,  the  United States  reaches  to  the  corners  of  the  earth  to  extract  income  from  its nationals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If a 747 jetliner filled with one investor from each jurisdiction on earth touched down in a newly independent country, and each investor risked $1,000 in a start-up 235</p>

<p class="calibre1">venture in the new economy, the American would face a far higher tax than  anyone  else  on  any  gains.  Special,  penal  taxation  of  foreign investment,  exemplified  by  the  so-called  PFIC  taxation,  plus  the  U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">nationality  tax,  can  result  in  tax  liabilities  of  200  percent  or  more  on long-term assets held outside the United States. A successful American could reduce his total lifetime tax burden as a citizen of any of more than 280 other jurisdictions on the globe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  United  States  has  the  globe's  most  predatory,  soak-the-rich  tax system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Americans  living  in  the  United  States  or  abroad  are  treated  more  like assets  and  less  like  customers  than  citizens  of  any  other  country.  The American tax regime is therefore more anachronistic and less compatible with success in the Information Age than those of even the notoriously high-tax welfare states of Scandinavia. Citizens of Denmark or Sweden face  few  legal  obstacles  in  realizing  their  growing  technological autonomy as individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Should they wish to negotiate their own tax rates, they are free to elect to pay taxes in Switzerland by private treaty, or move to Bermuda and pay 382</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-384"></a>no income taxes at all. A Swede or a Dane who wishes to pay high taxes because he believes the Scandinavian welfare state is worth what it costs is  actually  making  a  choice.  He  can  elect  to  be  taxed  at  any  rate  that prevails in any other jurisdiction in the civilized or uncivilized world. To change his tax rate, he need only move. Technology makes such a choice easier by the moment. Yet that option is denied to Americans. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Holding  a  U.S.  passport  is  destined  to  become  a  major  drawback  to realizing the opportunities for individual autonomy made possible by the Information Revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Being  born  an  American  during  the  industrial  period  was  a  lucky accident. Even in the early stages of the Information Age, it has become a multimillion-dollar liability. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To see how great a liability, consider this comparison. Under reasonable assumptions, a New Zealander with the same pretax performance as the average of the top 1 percent of American taxpayers would pay so much less in taxes that the compounding of his tax savings alone would make him richer than the American would ever be. At the end of a lifetime, the New Zealander would have $73 million more to leave to his children or grandchildren.  And  New  Zealand  is  not  even  a  recognized  tax  haven. </p>

<p class="calibre1">More  than  forty  other  jurisdictions  impose  lower  income  and  capital taxation than New Zealand. If our argument is right, the number of low-tax jurisdictions is likely to rise rather than fall. All of them will provide an  advantage  as  a  domicile  over  the  United  States,  worth  tens  of millions, if not hundreds of millions, over a lifetime. Unless U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">taxes  are  reformed  to  become  more  competitive  with  those  of  other jurisdictions,  and  are  no  longer  levied  on  the  basis  of  nationality, thinking persons will renounce U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">citizenship, notwithstanding the obstacles imposed by Clinton's exit tax. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The competitive conditions of the Information Age will render it possible to  earn  high  incomes  almost  anywhere.  In  effect,  the  locational monopolies  that  nationstates  exploited  to  impose  extremely  high  taxes will be broken by technology.

<p class="calibre1">The  flight  of  the  wealthy  from  advanced  welfare  states  will  happen  at just  the  wrong  time  demographically.  Early  in  the  twenty-first  century, large  aging  populations  in  Europe  and  North  America  will  find themselves  with  insufficient  savings  to  meet  medical  expenses  and finance  their  lifestyles  in  retirement.  For  example,  fully  65  percent  of Americans have no savings for retirement at all. None. And those who do save far too little. The average American will reach sixty-five facing expected  medical  bills  of  more  than  $200,000  before  death  and  with  a net worth of less than $75,000. Even the minority with private pensions are unlikely to be comfortable. The average pension will replace only 20</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent of pre-retirement income. Most of the assets of the typical retiree are  not  real  wealth  but  "transcendental  capital,"  the  expected  value  of transfer payments. Most people have been conditioned to rely upon these transfer  payments  to  make  up  the  gap  in  their  private  resources.  The catch is that they are unlikely to be forthcoming. Pay-as-you-go systems will  lack  the  cash  flow  or  resources  to  make  good  on  them.  A  study conducted  by  Neil  Howe  showed  that  even  if  pretax  incomes  in  the United  States  were  to  rise  faster  than  they  have  over  the  past  twenty years,  average  after-tax  incomes  in  America  would  have  to  be  pushed down  by  59  percent  by  2040  in  order  to  finance  Social  Security  and government medical programs at current levels. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is not a problem that can be manipulated around the margins. The welfare  state  faces  insolvency.  Its  financing  predicament  is  even  more acute in Europe than in North America. Italy is perhaps the worst case, followed closely by Sweden and the other Nordic welfare states that set 384</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-386"></a>the  standard  for  generous  terms  in  income-support  programs.  The Financial  Times  estimates  that  if  "the  present  value  of  Italian  state pensions is included, the country's public sector debt would rise to more than 200 percent of GDP" 91</p>

<p class="calibre1">Indebtedness  at  such  levels  is  all  but  mathematically  hopeless.  A comprehensive  study  of  commercial  indebtedness  of  Toronto  Stock Exchange  companies  undertaken  a  few  years  ago  showed  that  few survive  debt  ratios  one-quarter  as  extreme  as  those  facing  the  leading welfare  states  today.  92  Put  simply,  they  are  broke.  As  this  reality  is faced,  grudgingly  but  inevitably,  literally  trillions  in  unfunded entitlement obligations will be written off. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such is the logic of the cybereconomy. One possible hitch may be simple inertia, the nesting instinct that makes humans reluctant to pick up stakes and move. If there are other hitches, they may be hardwired into human nature. The economic logic of deploying assets in cyberspace could run counter to the biologic expressed in the ingrained suspicions of outsiders. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Children  in  every  culture  show  an  aversion  to  strangers.  Opponents  of the commercialization of sovereignty will do their best to inflame doubts about the new global culture of the Information Age and the demise of the  nationstate  that  it  implies.  Another  possible  hitch  arising  from epigenesis, or genetically influenced motivational factors, is the prospect that  the  "losers  and  leftbehinds"  will  respond  to  developments  that undermine the nationstate with the fury of hunter-gatherers 237</p>

<p class="calibre1">385</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-387"></a><b class="calibre4">VIOLENCE IN PERSPECTIVE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">There  are  at  least  two  contending  theories  about  what  precipitates violence  in  conditions  of  change.  Historian  Charles  Tilly  summarizes one theory: "[T]he stimulus to collective violence comes largely from the anxieties  people  experience  when  established  institutions  fall  apart.  If misery  or  danger  compounds  the  anxiety,  runs  the  theory,  the  reaction becomes all the more violent." In Tilly's view, however, violence is not so much a product of anxiety as it is a far more rational attempt to bully authorities into meeting their responsibilities" motivated by a "sense of justice  denied."  According  to  Tilly's  interpretation,  "large  structural changes"  tend  to  stimulate  collective  violence  of  a  "political"  nature. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Instead  of  constituting  a  sharp  break  from  'normal'  political  life, furthermore,  violent  struggles  tend  to  accompany,  complement,  and extend  organized,  peaceful  attempts  by  the  same  people  to  accomplish their  objectives.  They  belong  to  the  same  world  as  nonviolent contention." 94</p>

<p class="calibre1">Whichever theory of violence is more correct, prospects for social peace during  the  Great  Transformation  would  appear  to  be  limited.  The collapse of the nationstate surely counts as a conspicuous example of an</p>

<p class="calibre1">"established institution falling apart." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  anxieties  are  likely  to  be  in  full  flower,  as  will  the  political inspiration  for  violence.  This  could  be  especially  true  in  the  leading welfare  states,  where  populations  are  accustomed  to  relative  income equality.  Given  that  populations  in  the  early  stages  of  the  information economy  will  have  come  of  age  during  the  industrial  period,  when political  authorities  did  have  the  capacity  to  answer  grievances  with material benefits, it is reasonable to expect the "leftbehinds" to continue to demand material benefits. It will probably take a slow, painful tutorial in the realities of the cybereconomy before OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">populations are weaned away from expectations of being able to compel income  redistribution  on  a  large  scale.  In  either  case,  whether  violence arises  from  "anxiety"  or  as  a  more  calculating  effort  to  harness  the 386</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-388"></a>benefits  of  systematic  compulsion,  conditions  would  appear  to  make violence likely. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Constituencies of Losers</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">238</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  collapse  of  coerced  income  redistribution  is  bound  to  upset  those who  expect  to  be  on  the  receiving  end  of  the  trillions  in  transfer programs.  Mostly,  these  will  be  "the  losers  or  leftbehinds,"  persons without the skills to compete in global markets. Like the pensioners of the former Soviet Union who formed the core of Zuganov's Communist support,  the  disappointed  pensioners  of  the  dying  welfare  states  will form  a  reactionary  constituency  keen  to  prevent  the  sovereignty  of  the nationstates  from  being  privatized,  thereby  depriving  the  state  of  its license  to  steal.  As  they  realize  that  governments  they  formerly controlled are losing their sovereignty over resources and the ability to compel  large-scale  income  transfers,  they  will  become  as  adamant  as French civil servants in fighting arithmetic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  may  remember  the  violent  reaction  that  greeted  Prime  Minister Alain  Juppe's  quite  modest  proposals  to  scale  back  "demographically unsustainable"  retirement  benefits  of  state  workers  and  economize  the operations of the nationalized railroad system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Symbolic of the absurdity of the  <i class="calibre3">Etat Providence</i>, as the French call their social  welfare  system,  is  the  rule  that  allows  "engineers  on  the computerized, high-speed TGV trains to retire at age fifty, just like their predecessors who toiled on the coal-fired locomotive" 95</p>

<p class="calibre1">A  rowdy  reaction  to  cutbacks  of  unsustainable  benefits  is  a  distinct possibility in any OECD country. And even where populations respond less angrily, you can expect the probable losers to do whatever is within their power to forestall the erosion of state compulsion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  lead  to  some  surprising  twists.  In  the  United  States,  for example, nativist sentiment has historically been tinged with more than a slight tincture of racism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">387</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-389"></a>This is a tradition that began with the nineteenth-century "White Caps" </p>

<p class="calibre1">and  Ku  Klux  Klan.  Yet  blacks,  as  a  group,  are  major  beneficiaries  of income  transfers,  affirmative  action,  and  other  fruits  of  political compulsion.  They  are  also  disproportionately  represented  in  the  U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">military.  Therefore,  they  are  likely  to  emerge,  along  with  blue-collar whites, as among the most fervent partisans of American nationalism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Politicians  willing  to  cater  to  the  insecurities  of  those  whose  relative talents fall well down on Ammon's turnip will come noisily to the fore in almost every country. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia to Pat Buchanan in the United States to  Winston  Peters  in  New  Zealand,  to  Necmettin  Erbakan  of  Turkey's fundamentalist  Islamic  Welfare  Party,  demagogues  will  rail  against  the globalization of markets, immigration, and freedom of investment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Particular  animus  will  be  directed  toward  the  rich  and  immigrants  by those  who  imagine  themselves  to  be  the  "global  economy's  casualties." </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the words of Andrew Heal, they will "despise the entry of immigrants whose main entry criterion appears to be their wealth or their lack of it, which, the specious logic goes, makes them welfare burdens." 96</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Fear of Freedom</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  prospect  of  the  disappearance  of  the  nationstate  early  in  the  new millennium seems timed to effect the maximum disruption in the lives of suggestible people. This 239</p>

<p class="calibre1">will lead to widespread unpleasantness. More than a few observers have recognized  a  pattern  of  reaction  that  is  common  among  those  who  feel left  out  by  the  prospect  of  a  borderless  world.  As  the  larger,  more inclusive national grouping begins to break down, with the more mobile</p>

<p class="calibre1">"information elite" globalizing their affairs, the "losers and leftbehinds" </p>

<p class="calibre1">fall  back  upon  membership  in  an  ethnic  subgroup,  a  tribe,  a  gang,  a religious  or  linguistic  minority.  Partly,  this  is  a  practical  and  pragmatic reaction  to  the  collapse  of  services,  including  law  and  order,  formerly provided  by  the  state.  For  persons  with  few  marketable  resources,  it often proves difficult to purchase access to market alternatives to failed public services. </p>

<p class="calibre1">388</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-390"></a>The transformation of what were formerly treated as public goods, such as education, provision of clean water, and neighborhood policing, into private  goods  is  obviously  easier  to  manage  for  those  with  sufficient resources to purchase high-quality private alternatives. For those wanting cash, however, the most practical alternative is often to depend upon kin, or  join  a  mutual-aid  group  organized  along  ethnic  lines,  like  the  old ethnic  Chinese  "Hokkien"  of  Southeast  Asia,  or  through  a  religious congregation.  In  those  parts  of  the  world  where  dynamic,  proselytizing religions are active, part of the popularity of their programs depends on the  fact  that  they  tend  to  hark  back  to  premodern  mechanisms  for providing  social  welfare  and  public  goods.  For  example,  Moslem-led vigilante groups have played a leading role in combating violent gangs in Cape  Town,  South  Africa.97  But  as  practical  and  pragmatic  as  such ethnic and religious organization of help can be, more is involved in the reactionary response to the withering of the state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There also seems to be a strong psychological component in the reaction against globalization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The argument is not dissimilar to the psychological explanation for the appeal of fascism developed by Erich Fromm in his famous work Fear of Freedom, first published in 1942. According to Fromm, social mobility introduced by capitalism had destroyed the fixed identities of traditional village life. The son of a farmer no longer knew that he would inevitably be a farmer, or even that he would be bound to live scrabbling to harvest a crop on the same poor ground that his father tilled. He now had a broad choice  of  occupation.  He  could  become  a  schoolteacher,  a  merchant,  a soldier;  study  medicine  or  take  to  the  sea.  Even  as  a  farmer,  he  could emigrate to the United States, Canada, or Argentina and make a life far from the home of his forebears. This freedom that capitalism provided to people  "to  create  their  own  identities"  proved  scary  to  those  who  were not prepared to make creative use of it. As Billig said, they yearned "for the security of a solid identity," and were "drawn towards the simplicities of nationalist and fascist propaganda."99 Equally as Billig writes of the twilight of the industrial era, "There is a global psychology, which strikes the nation from above, withering loyalties with a free play of identities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And then, there is the hot psychology of caste or tribe, which hits at the soft underbelly of the state with a powerfully intolerant commitment and emotional ferocity." 100</p>

<p class="calibre1">389</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-391"></a>Andrew Heal views the same phenomenon from another perspective. He sees two great "global political and economic trends. . . . Trend one is the growth  of  the  global  economy.  .  .  The  second  is  the  rise  of  nationalist, ethnic and regionalist sentiment, whether it be Maori, Scottish, Welsh or from anti-immigrant factions, who even as their 240</p>

<p class="calibre1">governments  push  them  towards  new,  borderless  horizons,  pull themselves ever so hard the opposite way." 101 However you choose to look at them, whether as major "trends" </p>

<p class="calibre1">or "psychological themes," it is clear that a strong reactionary sentiment in favor of nationalism and against the fall of borders and the deepening of markets is gathering its voice worldwide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">390</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-392"></a><b class="calibre4">MULTICULTURALISM </b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">AND</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">VICTIMIZATION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">In its twilight, with a faltering capacity to redeem promises of something for nothing from an empty pocket, the welfare state found it expedient to foster  new  myths  of  discrimination.  Many  categories  of  officially</p>

<p class="calibre1">"oppressed"  people  were  designated,  especially  in  North  America. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Individuals in groups with designated status as "victims" </p>

<p class="calibre1">were informed that they were not responsible for shortcomings in their own lives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rather,  the  fault  was  said  to  lie  with  "dead  white  males"  of  European descent,  and  the  oppressive  power  structure  allegedly  rigged  to  the disadvantage of the excluded groups. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To be black, female, homosexual, Latino, francophone, disabled,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i> was to be entitled to recompense for past repression and discrimination. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If Lasch's argument is to be believed, the purpose of heightening a sense of victimization was to undermine nations, making it easier for the new, footloose  information  elite  to  escape  the  commitments  and  duties  of citizenship. We are not entirely convinced that the new elite, especially most of those in the mass media, are cunning enough to reason to such a posture. It would almost be reassuring to feel that they were. We see the growth of victimization as mainly an attempt to buy social peace by not only widening membership in the meritocracy as Lasch argues, but also by reconstituting the rationalizations for income redistribution. The new sport  of  victimology  emerged  in  its  most  exaggerated  form  in  North America because information technology penetrated more deeply there. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We suspect, however, that new myths of discrimination will be common, to  one  degree  or  another,  in  all  industrial  societies  in  their  senile  state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  multiethnic  welfare  states  in  North  America  were  simply  more vulnerable to the temptation to foist the costs of income redistribution on the private sector. They were able to do this, while inflaming a sense of grievance  and  entitlement,  by  blaming  the  structure  of  society  as  a 391</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-393"></a>whole,  and  white  men  in  general,  for  the  economic  shortcomings  of various subcultures within society. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Megapolitics of Innovation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  before  information  technology  began  to  threaten  "creative destruction" of the industrial economy, it had clearly antiquated much of the  cherished  myth  of  Marxists  and  socialists.  We  examined  the megapolitics  of  innovation  in  a  previous  chapter.  The  point  we emphasized  there  is  of  importance  in  placing  the  social  impact  of  the Information  Revolution  into  perspective.  The  precedent  of  technology expanding  employment  opportunities  in  recent  centuries  seems  like  a dependable rule of economic 241</p>

<p class="calibre1">life, but it need not be. It is possible for earnings to be concentrated in the hands of a prosperous minority. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">REAL WAGES DROP BY 50 PERCENT</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">That is indeed what happened during the first two centuries or more of the modern period. From the time of the Gunpowder Revolution around 1500  until  1700,  real  incomes  for  the  bottom  60-80  percent  of  the population in most of Western Europe fell by 50 percent or more. 102 In many  places,  real  income  continued  to  fall  until  1750,  and  did  not recover to 1500 levels until 1850. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike the experience of the past 250 years, the income gains of the first half  of  the  modern  period,  a  time  of  dramatic  expansion  of  Western European  economies,  were  concentrated  among  a  small  minority.  The current innovation of information technologies is quite different from the innovation of industrial technologies that the world experienced in recent centuries. The difference lies in the fact that most current technological innovations with labor-saving characteristics tend to create skilled tasks and reduce scale economies. This is the opposite of the experience since about 1750. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Industrial  innovation  tended  to  open  job  opportunities  for  the  unskilled and increase the scale economies of enterprise. This not only raised the earnings  of  the  poor  without  any  effort  on  their  part,  it  also  tended  to 392</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-394"></a>increase  the  power  of  political  systems,  making  them  more  capable  of withstanding  unrest.  Those  who  were  displaced  by  mechanization  and automation in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution tended to be skilled  artisans,  craftsmen  and  journeymen,  rather  than  unskilled  labor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  was  certainly  true  in  the  textile  industry,  the  first  to  employ mechanization  and  power  equipment  on  a  large  scale,  which  led  to  a violent  reaction  by  Luddites,  who  destroyed  textile  machinery  and murdered  factory  owners  during  a  rampage  in  the  early  nineteenth century. On the other hand, the followers of Captain Swing, the mythical leader of an 1830 rebellion in southeastern England, were day laborers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their  demands  included  imposing  a  levy  on  the  local  rich  to  provide them  with  money  or  beer,  imposing  a  wage  increase  upon  the  local employers  of  day  labor,  and  "destroying,  or  demanding  the  destruction of;  new  farm  machinery,  especially  threshers"  that  reduced  the  call among farmers for rural day labor. 103</p>

<p class="calibre1">Contrary  to  the  romantic  jabberings  of  Marxists  and  others  who  have transformed  the  violent  opponents  of  labor-saving  technology  into heroes,  they  were  an  unpleasant  and  violent  lot  who  opposed  the introduction  of  technology  that  raised  living  standards  worldwide  for purely selfish reasons. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While the violent followers of Ned Ludd and Captain Swing jeopardized public  order  for  many  months  in  England,  once  suppressed  by  central authority their movements were bound to miscarry. The poor, unskilled majority  were  unlikely  to  be  long  attracted  to  a  cause  that  promised  to destroy  machinery  that  offered  them  jobs  and  also  raised  their  living standards  by  lowering  the  cost  of  items  they  needed,  such  as  warm clothing and bread. </p>

<p class="calibre1">242</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Higher Incomes for the Unskilled</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Over  time,  industrial  and  agricultural  automation  was  attractive  to  the have-nots because it created earnings opportunities for them and lowered their  cost  of  living.  New  tools  allowed  those  without  skills  to  produce goods of quality equal to those made by persons of high skills. A genius 393</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-395"></a>and a moron on the assembly line would both produce the same product, and earn the same wage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Over  the  past  two  centuries,  industrial  automation  dramatically  raised wages for unskilled work, especially in the small part of the world where conditions  first  allowed  capitalism  to  flourish.  The  large  scale  of advanced  industrial  enterprise  not  only  rewarded  unskilled  labor  with unprecedented wages, it also facilitated income redistribution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  welfare  state  arose  as  a  logical  consequence  of  the  technology  of industrialism.  Because  of  their  large  scale  and  high  capital  costs,  the leading  industrial  employers  were  the  easiest  targets  to  tax.  And  they could  be  relied  upon  to  keep  records  and  enforce  the  garnishment  of wages  that  made  the  income  tax  technologically  feasible  as  it  had  not been  in  previous  centuries  when  economies  were  more  decentralized. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  net  effect  was  that  the  growth  of  scale  economies  promoted  by industrial  innovation  made  governments  richer,  and  presumably  better able to maintain order. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Process Is Reversed</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  our  judgment,  the  opposite  is  happening  today.  Information technology  is  raising  earnings  opportunities  for  the  skilled  and undermining  institutions  that  operate  at  a  large  scale,  including  the nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This points to another irony of the Information Age-namely, the schizoid and  fundamentally  obstructionist  attitude  of  critics  of  the  free  market toward  the  rise  and  fall  of  industrial  jobs.  In  the  early  stages  of industrialism, they were choked up about the supposed evil of industrial jobs, which lured landless peasants away from "the world we have lost." </p>

<p class="calibre1">To hear the critics tell it, the advent of factory jobs was an unprecedented evil and "exploitation" of the working class. But now it appears that the only thing worse than the advent of factory jobs is their disappearance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  great-grandchildren  of  those  who  wailed  about  the  introduction  of factory jobs are now wailing about the shortage of factory jobs that offer high pay for low-skilled work. </p>

<p class="calibre1">394</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-396"></a>The one coherent thread that runs through these complaints is a steadfast resistance  to  technological  innovation  and  market  change.  In  the  early stages of the factory system, this resistance led to violence. It may again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And not because capitalists are "exploiting the workers." The advent of the  computer  as  a  paradigm  technology  revealed  the  absurdity  of  that claim. It might have been half-credible for the inattentive to suppose that a  barely  literate  auto  worker  had  somehow  been  "exploited"  in  the production of an automobile by owners who conceived and financed the businesses that employed workers. The crucial role of conceptual 243</p>

<p class="calibre1">capital  in  the  production  and  marketing  of  tangible  products  was  less obvious  than  it  is  in  the  output  of  the  Information  Age,  which  clearly involves mental work. Therefore, the plausibility of the assumption that entrepreneurs  had  somehow  seized  the  value  of  information  products actually created by workers was much diminished. Where the value was clearly  created  through  mental  work,  as  in  the  production  of  consumer software, it was little short of preposterous to suppose that it was actually the product of anyone other than the skilled persons who conceived it. In fact,  far  from  assuming  that  the  workers  created  all  value,  as  Marxists and socialists did through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the  obvious  and  growing  trend  away  from  unskilled  employment  gave rise  to  a  spreading  worry  about  quite  the  opposite  problem  -whether unskilled laborers still had any economic contribution to make.'04</p>

<p class="calibre1">Hence the migration of the rationale for income redistribution away from exploitation,"  which  assumed  a  productive  competence  for  those  with low  incomes,  to  "discrimination,"  which  did  not.  "Discrimination," </p>

<p class="calibre1">however, was alleged to account for the failure of those with low skills to develop more valuable ones. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  discrimination  was  also  said  to  justify  imposition  of  nonoptimal hiring  criteria  and  other  standards  for  opening  "opportunity,"  or,  more precisely,  redistributing  income  to  the  lagging  groups.  In  the  United States,  for  example,  race-based  norming  of  achievement  and  aptitude tests  allowed  blacks  to  outscore  white  and  Asian  applicants  while registering  lower  objective  scores.  Through  this  method  and  others, governments obliged employers to hire more blacks and other officially</p>

<p class="calibre1">"victimized" groups at higher wages than might otherwise have been the 395</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-397"></a>case. Anyone who failed to comply faced costly court actions, including lawsuits involving large punitive damages. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The point of designating victims was not to incubate paranoid delusions of  persecution  among  important  subgroups  of  industrial  society,  or  to subsidize  the  spread  of  counterproductive  values.  It  was  to  relieve  the bankrupt  state  of  the  fiscal  pressures  of  redistributing  income. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Inculcating  delusions  of  persecution  was  merely  an  unfortunate  side effect. Ironically, the surge in concern about "discrimination" coincided with the early stages of a technological revolution that is bound to make actual arbitrary discrimination far less of a problem than it has ever been before.  No  one  on  the  Internet  knows  or  cares  whether  the  author  of  a new  software  program  is  black,  white,  male,  female,  homosexual,  or  a vegetarian dwarf. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While the reality of discrimination is bound to be less oppressive in the future, that will not necessarily relieve the pressure for "reparations" to compensate various real or imagined wrongs. Every society, whatever its objective  circumstances,  gives  rise  to  one  or  more  rationalizations  for income redistribution. They range from the subtle to the absurd, from the biblical injunction to love your neighbor as yourself, to the invocations of black magic. Sorcery, witchcraft, and the evil eye are the flip side of religious  feeling,  the  spiritual  equivalent  of  the  Inland  Revenue  or  the IRS.  When  people  cannot  be  moved  by  love  to  subsidize  the  poor,  the poor themselves will try to see that they are moved by fear. Sometimes this takes the form of an outright shakedown, a knife to the throat, a gun to  the  head.  At  other  times,  the  threat  is  disguised  or  fanciful.  It  is  no coincidence that most of the "witches" of the early modern period were widows  or  unmarried  women  with  few  resources.  They  terrorized  their neighbors with curses that not infrequently moved 244</p>

<p class="calibre1">those neighbors to pay up. It is by no means obvious that those who did so were only the superstitious. The malevolent intent of the evil eye was not a superstition but a fact. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even a poor woman could loose cattle or set someone's house ablaze. In that  sense,  the  witchcraft  trials  of  the  early  modern  period  were  not altogether  so  preposterous  as  they  seem.  While  the  punishments  were cruel  and  no  doubt  many  innocents  suffered  from  the  hallucinations  of 396</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-398"></a>neighbors  under  the  influence  of  ergot  poisoning,  the  prosecution  of witches can be understood as an indirect way of prosecuting extortion. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  expect  a  return  of  extortion  motivated  by  a  desire  to  share  in  the rewards of achievement as the Information Age unfolds. Groups that feel aggrieved  over  past  discrimination  are  unlikely  to  quickly  relinquish their apparently valuable status as victims simply because their claims on society become less justified or harder to enforce. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  continue  to  press  their  claims  until  evidence  in  the  local environment leaves no doubt that they will no longer be rewarded. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  growth  of  sociopathic  behavior  among  Afro-Americans  and  Afro-Canadians tells you that. It says that there is little balance between black anger and a realistic appraisal of the extent to which black problems are self-inflicted consequences of antisocial behavior. Black anger has risen, even as black lifestyles have grown more dysfunctional. Out-of-wedlock births have soared. Educational attainment has fallen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Growing  percentages  of  young  blacks  are  implicated  in  criminal activities,  to  the  point  where  there  are  now  more  black  men  in penitentiaries than in colleges. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These perverse results may have had the temporary effect of increasing the  flow  of  resources  to  underclass  communities  during  the  twilight  of industrialism by raising the shakedown threat against society as a whole. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  the  effect  could  be  only  temporary.  By  eliminating  the  beneficial impact  of  competition  in  challenging  underachievers  to  conform  to productive  norms,  the  welfare  state  has  helped  to  create  legions  of dysfunctional,  paranoid,  and  poorly  acculturated  people,  the  social equivalent  of  a  powder  keg.  The  death  of  the  nationstate  and  the disappearance  of  income  redistribution  on  a  large  scale  will  no  doubt lead some among the more pyschopathic of these unhappy souls to strike out against anyone who appears more prosperous than they. Therefore, it is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  social  peace  will  be  in  jeopardy  as  the Information Age unfolds, especially in North America and in multiethnic enclaves in Western Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Neo-Luddite</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Given  past  experience  of  antitechnological  rebellion  in  the  early nineteenth  century  and  the  long  tradition  of  collective  violence  in  both Europe  and  North  America,  no  one  should  be  surprised  to  see  a  neo-Luddite  attack  upon  information  technology  and  those  who  use  it.  The Luddites,  referred  to  earlier,  were  cloth  workers  concentrated  in  West Yorkshire,  England,  who  launched  a  terrorist  campaign  against automated cropping machines and the factory owners who adopted them in 181l-l2. 106 With blackened 245</p>

<p class="calibre1">faces, the Luddites raged through West Yorkshire, burning factories and murdering factory owners who dared to adopt the new technology. Most of the violence was the work of "croppers," highly skilled artisans whose labor  in  wielding  gigantic  scissors  weighing  up  to  fifty  pounds  was previously  a  crucial  part  of  the  production  of  woolen  cloth.  But  the finishing  work  that  the  croppers  performed,  "raising  the  nap  by  teasels and cropping the cloth by shears," was, as Robert Reid, author of the best and most comprehensive discussion of the Luddite rising, Land of Lost Content:  The  Luddite  Revolt  1812,  observed,  "too  simple  not  to  be mechanized." 107 The design of one such mechanized cropping machine had been sketched out by Leonardo da Vinci. Yet Leonardo's design for automatic cropping languished for centuries. Finally, by 1787, a device like Leonardo's was reinvented and brought into production in England. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Reid  notes,  "so  long  had  all  the  constituent  parts  of  the  technology been known that the surprise is that it had not been introduced earlier. . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  new  equipment  of  the  Industrial  Revolution  required  so  little strength and skill to use that many job openings were taken by women and young children, initially at low wages. One of these new machines, even  operated  by  the  relatively  unskilled,  could  now  crop  in  eighteen hours what a skilled cropper using hand shears took eighty-eight hours to do." 108</p>

<p class="calibre1">398</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-400"></a>Note  that  the  workers  who  railed  at  mechanization  were  quite discriminating in their opposition to new technology. They only attacked and  fought  those  technologies  that  displaced  their  own  jobs  or  reduced the  demand  for  skilled  labor.  When  an  entrepreneur  named  William Cooke  introduced  carpet-weaving  machinery  into  the  West  Yorkshire district,  this  sparked  no  violence  whatever.  No  attempts  were  made  to burn Cooke's mill, or destroy his machinery, much less murder him. As Robert Reid explains in his history of the Luddite uprisings, Cooke's new technology  excited  no  opposition  because  carpets  were  a  product  "in which no one in the valley had until then specialized." </p>

<p class="calibre1">109  Reid  continues,  "Because  Cooke  introduced  a  new  product  and created  employment  founded  on  no  traditional  practices  whatever,  his mill flourished. " 110 This is an example with important application for the future. It suggests that thinking entrepreneurs in the next millennium will first introduce dramatic labor-saving automation in regions without a tradition of producing whatever product or service is in question. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  the  past  is  a  guide,  the  most  violent  of  the  terrorists  of  the  early decades  of  the  new  millennium  will  not  be  homeless  paupers  but displaced  workers  who  formerly  enjoyed  middle-class  incomes  and status.  This  was  certainly  the  case  in  the  Luddite  uprising  of  1812,  in which the bulk of the Luddites were not an impoverished proletariat but skilled artisans who were accustomed to earning incomes five times or more  greater  than  those  of  an  average  worker.  The  equivalent  group today  would  probably  be  displaced  factory  workers.  Unfortunately, scanning the demographics of most OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">countries,  one  finds  more  areas  than  not  that  could  be  highlighted  as potential sites of violent reaction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  world's  nationstates  will  seek  to  counteract  the  cybereconomy  and Sovereign Individuals who are able to take advantage of it to accumulate wealth.  A  furious  nationalist  reaction  will  sweep  the  world.  Part  and parcel  of  it  will  be  an  antitechonological  reaction  equivalent  to  the Luddite  and  other  antitechnology  rebellions  in  Britain  during  the Industrial Revolution. This should be considered closely, because it 246</p>

<p class="calibre1">399</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-401"></a>could  be  a  key  to  the  evolution  of  governance  in  the  new  millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One of the crucial challenges of the great transformation ahead will be maintaining  order  in  the  face  of  escalating  violence,  or  alternatively escaping its brunt. Individuals and firms that are particularly associated with  the  advent  of  the  Information  Age,  including  those  in  Silicon Valley,  and  even  the  suppliers  of  electricity  required  to  power  the  new technology,  will  have  to  maintain  a  special  diligence  against  freelance, neo-Luddite terrorism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  lunatic  like  the  Unabomber  is  unfortunately  likely  to  stimulate brigades of imitators as frustration with falling incomes and resentment against achievement mount. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  suspect  much  of  the  violence  to  come  will  involve  bombings.  As reported  in  the  New  York  Times,  domestic  terrorism  across  the  United States soared during the 1990s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"They increased by more than 50 percent in the last five years, and have nearly  tripled  over  the  last  decade.  The  number  of  criminal  explosions and  attempts  went  from  1,103  in  1985  to  3,163  in  1994....  [I]n  small towns and suburban neighborhoods, as well [as]</p>

<p class="calibre1">among inner-city street gangs, there has been a proliferation of a sort of garden variety bomber." 111</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Defense Becomes a Private Good</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1"></p>

<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  penal  taxes  imposed  by  nationstates  as  a  price  of protection,  they  are  unlikely  to  provide  it  effectively  in  the  years  to come.  The  falling  scale  of  violence  implied  by  the  new  information technology makes the provision of a massive military establishment far less  useful.  This  implies  not  only  a  declining  decisiveness  in  warfare, meaning  that  states  will  be  less  able  to  actually  protect  citizens,  it  also implies that the apparent extraterritorial hegemony of the United States as the world's superpower will be less effective in the next century than the hegemony of Great Britain was in the nineteenth century. Until the onset  of  World  War  I,  power  could  be  effectively  and  decisively projected  from  the  core  to  the  periphery  at  relatively  low  cost.  In  the 400</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-402"></a>twenty-first century, the threats that major powers pose to the safety of life  and  property  will  necessarily  diminish  with  the  return  to  violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Falling returns to violence suggest that nationstates or empires capable of exercising  military  power  on  a  large  scale  are  unlikely  to  survive  or come into being in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  the  fiscal  requirement  for  provision  of  an  adequate  defense  falls,  it will  become  ever  more  credible  to  treat  protection  services  as  if  they were private goods. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After  all,  security  threats  on  a  diminished  scale  will  be  increasingly defensible  by  security  forces  of  the  kind  that  can  be  engaged commercially,  such  as  by  employing  walls,  fences,  and  security perimeters to screen out troublemakers. Further, a wealthy individual or firm  may  be  able  to  afford  to  hire  protection  against  most  threats  that would  be  likely  to  arise  in  the  Information  Age.  At  the  margin,  the diminished scale of military threats will increase the danger of anarchy, or competitive violence within a single territory. But it will also intensify competition  among  jurisdictions  in  the  provision  of  protection  on competitive  terms.  This  will  mean  intensified  shopping  among jurisdictions for protection services, passport and consular services, and the provision of justice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the long run, of course, Sovereign Individuals will probably be able to travel  on  nongovernmental  documents,  issued  like  letters  of  credit  by private agencies and affinity 247</p>

<p class="calibre1">groups. It is not farfetched to suppose that a group will emerge as a kind of  merchant  republic  of  cyberspace,  organized  like  the  medieval Hanseatic  League,  to  facilitate  negotiation  of  private  treaties  and contracts  among  jurisdictions  as  well  as  to  provide  protection  for  its members. Imagine a special passport issued by the League of Sovereign Individuals, identifying the holder as a person under the protection of the league. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  a  document,  if  it  comes  into  existence,  will  be  only  a  temporary artifact of the transition away from the nationstate and the bureaucratic age  it  fostered.  Before  the  modern  period,  passports  were  generally unnecessary to pass frontiers, which were loosely defined in most cases. </p>

<p class="calibre1">401</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-403"></a>While  letters  of  safe  conduct  were  sometimes  employed  in  medieval frontier  societies,  they  were  normally  issued  by  the  authorities  whose realm  was  to  be  visited,  rather  than  the  jurisdiction  from  which  the traveler  originated.  More  important  than  a  passport  were  letters  of introduction  and  credit,  which  allowed  a  traveler  to  find  lodging  and negotiate  business.  That  day  will  come  again.  Ultimately,  persons  of substance  will  be  able  to  travel  without  documents  at  all.  They  will  be able to identify themselves on a foolproof biometric basis through voice-recognition systems or retinal scanning that recognizes them uniquely. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, we expect that sometime in the first half of the next century the world will experience the genuine privatization of sovereignty. This will accompany  conditions  that  could  be  expected  to  shrivel  the  realm  of compulsion  to  its  logical  minimum.  Yet  to  the  secular  inquisitors  and reactionaries  of  the  next  millennium,  the  placing  of  the  once  "sacred" </p>

<p class="calibre1">attributes of nationality onto a market footing to be bought and sold as a matter  of  cost-benefit  calculation  will  be  both  infuriating  and threatening. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We argue in this book that it will no longer take a nationstate to fight an Information  War.  Such  wars  could  be  undertaken  by  computer programmers deploying large numbers of "bots" or digital servants. Bill Gates  already  possesses  a  greater  capacity  to  detonate  logic  bombs  in vulnerable systems globally than most of the world's nationstates. In the age of the Information War, any software company, or even the Church of  Scientology,  would  be  a  more  formidable  antagonist  than  the accumulated threat posed by the majority of the states with seats in the United Nations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This loss of power by nationstates is a logical consequence of the advent of  low-cost,  advanced  computational  capacity.  Microprocessing  both reduces  returns  to  violence  and  creates  for  the  first  time  a  competitive market  for  the  protection  services  for  which  governments  charged monopoly prices in the industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  world  of  commercialized  sovereignty,  people  will  choose their jurisdictions, much as many now choose their insurance carriers or their religions.*</p>

<p class="calibre1">402</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-404"></a>Jurisdictions  that  fail  to  provide  a  suitable  mix  of  services,  whatever those may be, will face bankruptcy and liquidation, just as incompetent commercial enterprises or failed religious congregations do. Competition will therefore mobilize the efforts of local jurisdictions to improve their capacity to provide services economically and effectively. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  this  respect,  competition  between  jurisdictions  in  providing  public goods will have a similar impact to that observed in other sectors of life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Competition usually improves customer satisfaction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">248</p>

<p class="calibre1">403</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-405"></a><b class="calibre4">COMPETITION AND ANARCHY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">It is important to bear in mind that the competition between jurisdictions that  we  anticipate  is  not  mainly  competition  among  organizations employing  violence  in  the  same  territory.  As  indicated  earlier, competitive organizations using violence tend to increase the penetration of violence in life, reducing economic opportunity. As Lane put it, In the use  of  violence  there  were  obviously  great  advantages  of  scale  when competing  with  rival  violence-using  enterprises  or  establishing  a territorial monopoly. This fact is basic for the economic analysis of one aspect  of  government:  the  violence-using,  violence-controlling  industry was  a  natural  monopoly,  at  least  on  land.  Within  territorial  limits  the service  it  rendered  could  be  produced  much  more  cheaply  by  a monopoly.  To  be  sure,  there  have  been  times  when  violence-using enterprises  competed  in  demanding  payments  for  protection  in  almost the same territory, for example, during the Thirty Years' War in Germany. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  such  a  situation  was  even  more  uneconomic  than  would  be competition in the same territories between rival telephone systems. 112</p>

<p class="calibre1">*</p>

<p class="calibre1">See  Stephen  J.  Duhner,  'Choosing  My  Religion,"  New  York  Times Magazine, March 31, 1996, p. 36f. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lane's comment is informative in two respects. Firstly, we agree with his general  conclusion  that  sovereignties  will  tend  to  exercise  territorial monopolies because doing so will allow them to offer cheaper and more effective  protection  services.  The  second  interesting  aspect  of  Lane's comment  is  his  dated  comparison  with  monopoly  telephone  service. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  we  now  know  that  telephone  systems  need  not  be monopolies.  This  introduces  a  caution  into  the  analysis.  Changes  in technological  conditions  may  to  some  extent  obviate  the  general conclusion that anarchy within territorial limits is nonviable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For example, if cyberassets grow to large scale in a realm that puts them outside the reach of compulsion, the pricing of protection services may be much less a matter of "demand" </p>

<p class="calibre1">and more a matter of market negotiation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">404</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-406"></a>Nonetheless,  what  we  refer  to  here  is  something  different  from generalized  anarchy-namely,  competition  among  jurisdictions,  each enjoying  a  monopoly  of  violence  in  its  own  territory.  We  see  such jurisdictions  competing  to  offer  the  greatest  value  possible  in  the  cost-effective  provision  of  protection  services  that  appeal  to  their</p>

<p class="calibre1">"customers."  Admittedly,  there  will  no  doubt  be  greater  ambiguities  in the  provision  of  protection  services  in  the  Information  Age,  with  more complete private provision of policing and defense services than we have been  accustomed  to  seeing  before.  Yet  the  competition  we  envision  is different from a clash of multiple protection agencies battling on a large scale  to  provide  service  to  different  customers  in  the  same  territory, which is anarchy</p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  in  strict  logic,  the  multiplication  of  sovereignties,  with individuals assuming more of the role of sovereigns in cases when they accumulate sufficient resources, inevitably implies that there will be an increase  in  the  scope  for  anarchy  in  the  world.  The  relations  between sovereignties  are  always  anarchic.  There  is  not  and  never  has  been  a world  government  regulating  the  behavior  of  individual  sovereignties, whether ministates, nationstates, or empires. As Jack Hirshleifer writes, " </p>

<p class="calibre1">[W]hile associations ranging from primitive tribes to modern nationstates are all governed internally by some 249</p>

<p class="calibre1">form  of  law,  their  external  relations  with  one  another  remain  mainly anarchic."  "3  When  there  are  more  sovereign  entities  in  the  world, inevitably more relations transpire in more than one jurisdiction and are therefore anarchic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  important  to  note  that  anarchy,  or  the  lack  of  an  overwhelming power  to  arbitrate  disputes,  is  not  synonymous  with  total  chaos  or  the absence  of  form  or  organization.  Hirshleifer  notes  that  anarchy  can  be analyzed: "intertribal or international systems also have their regularities and systematic analyzable patterns." "4 In other words, just as "chaos" in mathematics  can  entail  an  intricate  and  highly  ordered  form  of organization, so "anarchy" is not entirely formless or disordered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hirshleifer  analyzes  a  number  of  anarchic  settings.  These  include,  in addition  to  relations  among  sovereignties,  gang  warfare  in  Prohibition-era  Chicago  and  "miners  versus  claim  jumpers  in  the  California  gold 405</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-407"></a>rush." Note that even though California was part of the United States by the  onset  of  the  gold  rush  in  1849,  conditions  in  the  goldfields  were properly  described  as  anarchy.  As  Hirshleifer  notes,  "[T]he  official organs of law were impotent." "' He argues that topographical conditions in  the  mountainous  camps,  plus  effective  vigilante  organization  by miners to combat claim jumpers, made it difficult for gangs of outsiders to seize gold mines, in spite of the lack of effective law enforcement. In other  words,  under  certain  conditions,  valuable  property  can  be effectively protected even under anarchy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The question is whether Hirshleifer's theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the spontaneous order of the Darwinian "natural economy" is of any relevance  to  the  economy  of  the  Information  Age.  We  suspect  it  is. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While we do not anticipate generalized anarchy, or goldfield conditions everywhere,  we  do  anticipate  an  increase  in  the  number  of  anarchic relations  in  the  world  system.  In  light  of  this  expectation,  Hirshleifer's argument  about  conditions  under  which  "two  or  more  anarchic contestants" </p>

<p class="calibre1">can  "retain  viable  shares  of  the  socially  available  resources  in equilibrium" is suggestive.! </p>

<p class="calibre1">16 In particular, he explores when anarchy is prone to "break down" into <i class="calibre3">tyranny</i>  or  dominance  hierarchies,  which  happens  when  the  anarchic parties can be subdued by an overwhelming authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  issues  may  be  more  important  to  understand  in  the  Information Age than they were in the Industrial Age. Part of the reason that the finer distinctions  about  the  dynamics  of  anarchy  were  less  crucial  in  recent centuries than they may be in the new millennium is precisely because the  returns  to  violence  were  rising  through  the  modern  period.  This meant that massing larger and larger military forces, as nationstates did in  recent  centuries,  tended  to  make  for  decisive  warfare.  Decisive warfare, almost by definition, subdues anarchy by placing contestants for the  control  of  resources  under  the  domination  of  a  more  powerful authority.  On  the  other  hand,  declining  decisiveness  in  battle,  which corresponds  to  the  superiority  of  the  defense  in  military  technology, contributes to the dynamic stability of anarchy. Therefore, the apparent impact  of  information  technology  in  reducing  the  decisiveness  of 406</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-408"></a>military action should make the anarchy between minisovereignties more stable  and  less  prone  to  be  replaced  through  conquest  by  a  large government. Less decisiveness in battle also implies less fighting, which is an encouraging deduction for the world in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">250</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Viability</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  important  condition  for  anarchy  to  be  sustained  is  viability  or income adequacy. Individuals who lack a sufficient income to sustain life are likely either to (1) devote a great deal of effort to fighting in order to seize enough resources to survive, or (2) capitulate to another contestant in exchange for food and sustenance. Something similar to this occurred with the rise of feudalism during the transformation of the year 1000. We expect increasing numbers of low-income persons in Western countries who previously would have depended upon transfer payments from the state  to  affiliate  with  wealthy  households  as  retainers.  Nonetheless,  the mere  fact  of  inviability  by  some  contenders  in  a  Hobbesian  melee  (or war of all against all) is inconclusive. As Hirshleifer says, "[T]he mere fact  of  low  income  under  anarchy,  .  .  .  of  itself  provides  no  clear indication as to what is likely to happen next." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Character of Assets</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Still another interesting condition for the sustainability of anarchy is that resources  be  "predictable  and  defendable."  In  Hirshleifer's  analysis,  " </p>

<p class="calibre1">[A]narchy  is  a  social  arrangement  in  which  contenders  struggle  to conquer and defend durable resources." 118</p>

<p class="calibre1">He  defines  "durable  resources"  to  include  "land  territories  or  movable capital goods." 119</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  digital  resources  may  prove  to  be  predictable, but  they  will  not  be  '-durable  resources"  of  the  kind  that  Hirshleifer identifies with territoriality and anarchy. Indeed, if digital money can be transferred anywhere on the planet at the speed of light, conquest of the territory in which a cyberbank is incorporated may be a waste of time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nationstates  wishing  to  suppress  Sovereign  Individuals  would  have  to 407</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-409"></a>seize  simultaneously  both  the  world's  banking  havens  and  its  data havens.  Even  then,  if  encrypted  systems  are  designed  properly, nationstates would merely be able to sabotage or destroy certain sums of digital money, not seize it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The conclusion is that the most predictable and vulnerable assets of the rich  in  the  coming  Information  Age  may  be  their  physical  persons-in other words, their lives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Which  is  why  we  fear  Luddite-style  terrorism  in  the  coming  decades, some  of  it  perhaps  covertly  encouraged  by  agents  provocateurs  in  the employ of nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Over the long term, however, we doubt that the leading nationstates will succeed  in  suppressing  Sovereign  Individuals.  For  one  thing,  existing states, especially in capital-poor regions, will find that they have more to gain  by  harboring  Sovereign  Individuals  than  by  maintaining  solidarity with  the  North  Atlantic  nationstates  and  upholding  the  sanctity  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"international"  system.  The  fact  that  bankrupt,  high-tax  welfare  states want to keep "their citizens" and "their capital" in "their country" will not be  a  compelling  motive  to  be  observed  by  hundreds  of  fragmenting sovereignties elsewhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  say  this,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  there  are  thousands  of multinational  organizations  designed  to  condition  the  behavior  of  the world's various sovereignties. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There  can  be  little  doubt  that  some  of  these  organizations,  like  the European Union and the World Bank, are influential. But remember that the jurisdictions that make Sovereign 251</p>

<p class="calibre1">Individuals  welcome  stand  to  benefit  significantly  from  their  presence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  a  pigheaded  power  like  the  United  States,  which  is  bound  by current  trends  to  work  vigorously  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  a cybereconomy  outside  the  control  of  the  U.S.  government,  will ultimately not wish to exclude those residents of the globe with positive bank balances who do not wish to be Americans. This is especially likely inasmuch as shopping is now a major fascination of travelers. Ultimately, although well after others, the United States, or fragments thereof, will 408</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-410"></a>join  in  the  commercialization  of  sovereignty  because  of  competitive pressures. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Demand Creates Supply</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Those pressures will be felt more vigorously early on in nationstates with the  weakest  balance  sheets.  Among  the  new  "offshore"  centers  will  be fragments  and  enclaves  of  current  nationstates,  like  Canada  and  Italy, which  will  almost  surely  disintegrate  well  before  the  end  of  the  first quarter of the twenty-first century. The birth of a global market for high-quality, cost-efficient jurisdictions will help bring such jurisdictions into being.  As  in  ordinary  commerce,  small-scale  competitors  will  be  more nimble and better able to compete. The thinly populated jurisdiction can more easily structure itself to operate efficiently. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The information elite will seek high-quality protection on contract for a reasonable  fee.  While  this  fee  will  fall  well  short  of  what  would  be required to redistribute a noticeable benefit to the whole populations of nationstates as they are now structured, with tens of millions to hundreds of  millions  of  citizens,  it  would  not  be  trivial  in  a  jurisdiction  with  a population  in  the  tens  of  thousands  or  hundreds  of  thousands.  The  tax payments and other economic advantages accruing from the presence of a  small  number  of  exceedingly  rich  individuals  imply  a  far  higher  per capita benefit to a jurisdiction with a small rather than a huge population. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Since  it  will  be  practically  immaterial  where  one  domiciles  his businesses, except in the purely negative sense that some addresses will imply higher liabilities than others, small jurisdictions will find it easier to set commercially successful terms for protection. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  jurisdictions  with  small  populations  will  enjoy  a  decided advantage  in  formulating  a  fiscal  policy  attractive  to  Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We believe that the age of the nationstate is over, but this is not to say that  the  attraction  of  nationalism  as  a  tug  on  human  emotions  will  be immediately quieted. As an ideology, nationalism is well placed to draw upon universal emotional needs. We have all had the experience of awe, such as one might feel on first seeing a giant waterfall, or first standing 409</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-411"></a>at  the  entrance  to  a  great  cathedral.  We  have  all  had  the  experience  of belonging,  such  as  we  might  feel  at  a  family  Christmas  party,  or  as  a member  of  a  successful  team  in  some  sport.  Human  culture  calls  for  a response to both of these powerful emotions. We are illuminated by the historic  culture  of  our  own  country,  which  is  itself  part  of  the  larger culture of humanity. We are comforted by the knowledge that we belong to a cultural group, which gives us both a sense of participation and of identity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">252</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  impact  of  these  cultural  symbols  can  have  the  strongest  emotional effect. The American associations of the Flag, the National Anthem, or the  family  feast  at  Thanksgiving  Day,  the  English  associations  of  the monarchy  or  cricket-all  have  a  real  hold  on  the  imaginations  of American and English people, respectively, a hold that is reinforced by repetition and goes deep into the subconscious mind. Such symbols help to tell us what sort of people we are, and remind us of a national culture. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  anti-Vietnam  War  demonstrators  wanted  to  shock  the  rest  of  the United  States,  they  burned  the  flag.  Alienated  English  attack  the monarchy, and have even been known to dig holes in cricket pitches. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  trigger  points  are  superficial,  but  not  unimportant.  They  are  the associations  we  were  taught  to  bleed  for.  Whatever  the  change  in megapolitical  conditions  or  resulting  change  in  institutions,  they  will probably remain important in the imaginations of persons who came of age, as we did, in the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE TWILIGHT OF DEMOCRACY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Democratic  political  Systems  are  a  recent  affair  in  historical  terms. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">They had a brief existence</i> <i class="calibre3">in Greece and Rome, afterward reemerging in</i> <i class="calibre3">the 18th century, fewer than 200 years ago. . . . </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A cycle of repudiation may now have begun again."' </i> WILLIAM PFAFF</p>

<p class="calibre1">It is no secret that democracy has been relatively rare and fleeting in the history  of  governments.  In  those  times,  ancient  and  modern,  where democracy  has  prevailed,  it  has  depended  for  its  success  upon megapolitical  conditions  that  reinforced  the  military  power  and importance  of  the  masses.  Historian  Carroll  Quigley  explored  these characteristics  in   <i class="calibre3">Weapons  Systems  and  Political  Stability</i>.2  They  have included: 1. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Cheap  and  widely  dispersed  weaponry. </b>Democracy  tends  to  flourish when the cost to purchase useful weapons is low. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Weapons  that  can  be  used  effectively  by  amateurs</b>.  Democracy  is more  likely  when  anyone  can  use  effective  weapons  without  extended training. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A military advantage for a large number of participants on foot in</b> <b class="calibre4">battle. </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Quigley  points  out,  "[P]eriods  of  infantry  dominance  have  been periods in which political power has been more widely dispersed within the community and democracy has had a better chance to prevail."3</p>

<p class="calibre1">This is hardly a comprehensive catalogue of the conditions under which democracy  can  exist.  If  it  were,  democracy  would  not  have  become  a 411</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-413"></a>triumphant  system  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century.  Weapons  were arguably  more  expensive  in  the  twilight  of  the  industrial  era  than  ever. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And many of the most effective weapons definitely required specialists to  be  used  effectively.  Furthermore,  the  Gulf  War  between  the  United States,  its  allies,  and  Iraq  proved  how  vulnerable  large  contingents  of infantry are, even when nestled in trenches and dug-in fortifications. So why  has  democracy  appeared  to  flourish  under  these  conditions  as  the twentieth century winds down? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">DEMOCRACY, THE FRATERNAL TWIN OF COMMUNISM? </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">254</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  offered  a  paradoxical  explanation  in  Chapter  5,  namely  that democracy  flourished  as  a  fraternal  twin  of  Communism  precisely because it facilitated unimpeded control of resources by the state. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This conclusion may seem silly to the 'common sense" of the industrial era.  We  do  not  deny  that  within  the  terms  of  industrial  society, democratic  systems  and  Communism  were  stark  opposites.  But  seen from a megapolitical perspective, as they may more likely be seen from the  vantage  of  the  Information  Age,  the  two  systems  had  more  in common than you would have been led to suspect. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  a  setting  where  weaponry  was  grotesquely  expensive,  democracy became the decision mechanism that maximized control of resources by the state. Like state socialism, democratic systems made available huge sums to fund a massive military establishment. The difference was that the democratic welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of  the  state  than  could  the  state  socialist  systems.  That  is  saying something, because the state socialist or Communist systems laid claim to practically every asset worth having. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Seen  dispassionately  as  merely  a  resource-gathering  mechanism,  the democratic state was superior to state socialism as a recipe for enriching the  state.  As  we  explained  earlier,  democracy  made  substantially  more money available to the military because democracy was compatible with private ownership and capitalist productivity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">412</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-414"></a>The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state owned everything. The democratic welfare state, by contrast, made more limited initial claims. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It pretended to allow private ownership, although of a contingent kind, and thereby harnessed superior incentives to mobilize output. Instead of mismanaging  everything  from  the  start,  democratic  governments  in  the West allowed individuals to own property and accumulate wealth. Only after the wealth had been created did the democratic nationstates step in to tax a large fraction of it away. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  word  "large"  should  be  capitalized.  For  example,  in  1996  the lifetime federal tax rate in the United States stood at seventy-three cents on  the  dollar.  For  owners  of  corporations,  who  received  their  income through dividends, the rate was eighty-three cents on the dollar. And for anyone who sought to leave or give money to grandchildren, the federal tax rate was ninety-three cents on the dollar. When state and local taxes are  considered  as  well,  democratic  government  at  all  levels  confiscates the lion's share of each dollar earned in the United States. Predatory tax rates made the democratic state a  <i class="calibre3">de facto</i> partner with a three-quarters to nine-tenths  share  in  all  earnings.  This  was  not  the  same  thing  as  state socialism, to be sure. But it was a close relation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  democratic  state  survived  longer  because  it  was  more  flexible  and collected  more  prodigious  quantities  of  resources  compared  to  those available in Moscow or East Berlin. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Inefficiency, Where It Counted" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">We  have  described  the  megapolitical  advantages  of  democracy  as  a decision  rule  for  a  powerful  government  as  "inefficiency,  where  it counted." Compared to 255</p>

<p class="calibre1">Communism,  the  welfare  state  was  indeed  a  far  more  efficient  system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  compared  to  a  genuine  laissez-faire  enclave  like  Hong  Kong,  the welfare state was inefficient. Growth rates in Hong Kong were fabulous, but  their  superiority  lay  precisely  in  the  fact  that  the  resident  of  Hong Kong, not the government, was able to pocket 85 percent of the benefits of faster growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">413</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-415"></a>Hong Kong, of course, is not a democracy. Indeed, it is a mental model of  the  kind  of  jurisdiction  that  we  expect  to  see  flourish  in  the Information Age. In the Industrial Age, Hong Kong had no need to be a democracy,  as  it  was  spared  the  unpleasant  necessity  of  gathering resources  to  support  a  formidable  military  establishment.  Hong  Kong was  defended  from  the  outside,  so  it  could  afford  to  maintain  a  really free economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was precisely the capacity to rake in resources that made democracy supreme during the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mass democracy went hand in hand with industrialism. As Alvin Toffler has said, mass democracy "is the political expression of mass production, mass distribution, mass consumption, mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, and all the rest."4</p>

<p class="calibre1">Now  that  information  technology  is  displacing  mass  production,  it  is logical  to  expect  the  twilight  of  mass  democracy.  The  crucial megapolitical imperative that made mass democracy triumph during the Industrial Age has disappeared. It is therefore only a matter of time until mass democracy goes the way of its fraternal twin, Communism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mass  Democracy  Incompatible  with  the  Information  Age  A  moment's reflection  shows  that  the  technology  of  the  Information  Age  is  not inherently a mass technology. In military terms, as we have indicated, it opens the potential for "smart weapons" and "Information War," in which</p>

<p class="calibre1">"logic bombs" could sabotage centralized command and control systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not only does information technology clearly point toward the perfection of  weapons  operated  by  specialists;  it  also  reduces  the  decisiveness  of warfare, improving the relative position of the defense. Microtechnology makes possible dramatic gains in the military power of individuals, while reducing the importance of massed infantry formations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  this  means  the  end  of  mass  democracy,  especially  in  its predominant  form,  representative  misgovernment,  either  of  the congressional or parliamentary type. </p>

<p class="calibre1">414</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">OF</b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">MISREPRESENTATION</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">When megapolitical conditions change in a big way, as they are changing now, the organization of government inevitably changes as well. In fact, the form of representative government has traditionally been an artifact of  the  distribution  of  raw  power.  This  is  shown  by  the  very  fact  that representatives  are  chosen  on  a  geographic  basis,  rather  than  in  some other way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Think about it. In principle, a legislature would be just as democratic if its  members  were  chosen  according  to  any  arbitrary  division  of  the population. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Parliamentary  ridings  or  congressional  districts  could  be  based  on birthdays, or even alphabetical constituencies. Everyone born on January 1 could vote from one list of 256</p>

<p class="calibre1">candidates.  Those  born  on  January  2  from  another.  Or  every  person whose  name  began  with  "Aa"  to  "Af"  could  choose  among  one  list  of candidates.  Those  whose  names  began  with  "Ag"  would  chose  among another. And so on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">No  such  system  exists  now  for  several  reasons.  A  first  and  sufficient reason  is  that  it  was  technologically  impractical  in  the  eighteenth century. But even more important is the fact that birthday or alphabetical constituencies  would  not  have  reflected  or  even  approximated  the distribution  of  raw  power  that  the  vote  had  to  manifest  at  that  time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Persons  who  shared  no  more  than  birthdays  or  the  first  few  letters  of their  names  in  common  would  have  been  and  still  would  be  extremely hard to organize into any coherent power base. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Why Do Geographic Cross Sections Count More? </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  vote  really  did  begin  as  a  proxy  for  a  military  contest.  And  so  it remains,  if  only  in  a  veiled  way.  Such  contests  can  be  organized  along geographical lines, and more rarely, along kinship or religious lines. </p>

<p class="calibre1">415</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-417"></a>They cannot be organized on the basis of birthdays or first initials. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor can they be organized effectively according to occupations, except where occupations are confined within hereditary guilds, like the castes in India, or cluster locally the way farmers do in Iowa. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  whole  point  of  current  formulas  of  representation  is  that  they represent interests that are vested geographically, rather than along some other dimension. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Historically,  the  key  to  military  success  was  to  control  territory.  All military threats have formed locally. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Representative  systems  are  geared  to  provide  a  different  venue  for  the expression of that power. The fact that they inevitably tend to promote local  vested  interests  is  an  artifact  of  the  formula  of  representation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Geographic  constituencies  induce  representatives  to  target  favors  for special groups at the expense of the common interests that all residents of a country share. </p>

<p class="calibre1">New  Possibilities  Ahead  As  analysis  by  Public  Choice  economists  has shown,  apparently  minor  shifts  in  the  form  in  which  an  election  is structured, or the way the vote is calculated, have large and predictable consequences in altering the outcome.5 This is why serious students of politics today have to be serious students of constitutions. And it is one of  the  considerations  that  led  us  to  look  beyond  constitutions  to  the ultimate metaconstitution as determined by the prevailing megapolitical factors of a given environment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technological  change  has  already  swept  away  some  of  the  foundations for  confining  the  vote  to  geographic  constituencies.  When  modern representative  systems  emerged  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth centuries, almost all communications were local. Most people lived and died within a few miles of where they were born, and the whole of their commerce  and  communication  was  conducted  locally.  Today  there  is instantaneous  communication  worldwide.  You  can  do  business  with someone five thousand miles away almost as easily as with a neighbor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">257</p>

<p class="calibre1">416</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-418"></a>To  an  increasing  extent,  the  economy  is  transcending  geographic limitations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Society is far more mobile. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And so is wealth in the Information Age. Unlike a steel mill, a computer program  cannot  easily  be  held  hostage  to  the  local  political  process.  A steel mill can scarcely be moved when legislators determine to tax it or regulate its owners. A computer program can be transmitted by modem at  the  speed  of  light  anywhere  in  the  world.  The  owner  can  pack  his laptop  computer  and  fly  away.  This,  too,  undermines  the  megapolitical foundations of geographic constituencies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  major  difficulty  that  all  representative  democratic  systems  share  in light of our analysis is that their geographic constituencies are bound to overrepresent  the  vested  interests  of  industrial-era  enterprises.  The</p>

<p class="calibre1">"losers"  or  "leftbehinds"  are  perfect  constituents,  geographically concentrated and politically needy. The history of industrial democracy confirms  this.  "Winners"  from  new  industries  were  chronically underrepresented in legislative deliberations even in the high tide of the Industrial  Age  in  the  1930s.  6  The  tendency  of  politicians  to  represent the existing, established competitors, not the new enterprises that might come  into  being  or  the  potential  customers  of  new  enterprises,  is probably  an  inherent  feature  of  representative  government.  As  Mancur Olson argued in  <i class="calibre3">The Rise and Decline of Nations</i>, long-lived industries tend  to  develop  more  effective  "distributional  coalitions"  to  lobby  and struggle over political booty. 7 This problem is magnified immeasurably when  it  comes  to  the  economy  of  the  Information  Age.  The  more creative participants in the new economy are geographically distributed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore, they are unlikely to form a sufficient concentration to gain the attention of legislators, the way that salmon fishers in Scotland or wheat farmers in Saskatchewan do. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  many  of  the  dynamic  personalities  of  the  new  economy  are unlikely to be citizens of even the most encompassing jurisdiction. Thus they  will  have  little  ''voice  in  the  legislative  deliberations  of representative  democracies.  As  a  telling  example,  consider  the disreputable  efforts  of  American  math  PhDs  to  block  foreign mathematicians from taking jobs in the United States. Their xenophobic 417</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-419"></a>representations to Congress to block employers from hiring on the basis of  merit  are  all  too  likely  to  be  heeded.  The  antiquated  geographic representation  left  over  from  the  Industrial  Age  takes  no  heed  of  the foreign  mathematicians,  or  any  other  crucial  contributors  to  prosperity who are not voters. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Why  do  people  believe  in  the  legitimacy  of  democratic  institutions? </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Answering that question is</i> <i class="calibre3">almost as difficult as explaining why people</i> <i class="calibre3">believe in particular religious dogmas, for as is the</i> <i class="calibre3">case with religious</i> <i class="calibre3">beliefs,  the  degree  of  understanding,  of  skepticism  and  faith,  varies</i> <i class="calibre3">widely</i> <i class="calibre3">across the society and over time."9 </i> JUAN J. LINZ</p>

<p class="calibre1">Few have begun to think in a concerted way about the consequences of technological  change  in  undermining  industrialism  and  altering  income distributions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  democracy  is  not  likely  to  be  much  more  than  a  recipe  for legalized  parasitism  if  incomes  diverge  as  widely  as  they  may  in  the information  economy.  Fewer  still  have  noticed  the  implied incompatibility  between  some  of  the  institutions  of  industrial government and the megapolitics of postindustrial society. Whether these 258</p>

<p class="calibre1">contradictions  are  explicitly  acknowledged  or  not,  however,  their consequences will become increasingly obvious as examples of political failure  compound  around  the  world.  Institutions  of  government  that emerged in the modern period reflect the megapolitical conditions of one or more centuries ago. They survived the transition from agrarian society to  urban  industrialism.  But  the  Information  Age  may  require  new mechanisms  of  representation  to  avoid  chronic  dysfunction  and  even Soviet-style collapse. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  can  expect  to  see  crises  of  misgovernment  in  many  countries  as political  promises  are  deflated  and  governments  run  out  of  credit  and institutional support. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ultimately, new institutional forms will have to emerge that are capable of preserving freedom in the new technological conditions, while at the 418</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-420"></a>same  time  giving  expression  and  life  to  the  common  interests  that individuals share. </p>

<p class="calibre1">All this points to the end of mass democracy as we have known it in the twentieth century. The question is, What will take its place? If the only alternative to mass democracy were dictatorship in which the individual has  no  say  in  his  destiny,  then  one  might  be  tempted  to  join  the  neo-Luddites' "revolt against the future." New Institutions Happily, however, dictatorship  is  not  the  sole  alternative  to  mass  democracy.  We  believe that the technology of the Information Age will give rise to new forms of governance-just  as  the  Agricultural  Revolution  and,  later,  the  industrial era brought forth their own distinctive forms of social organization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What might such new institutions be? Somewhere, in some jurisdiction, sometime  before  the  crack  of  doom,  someone  will  realize  the  potential that  computer  technology  offers  to  make  possible  truly  representative government. The supposed problem of excessive campaign expenditures and the undoubted annoyance of chronic political campaigning could be resolved in an instant. Rather than being elected, representatives could be selected by sortition entirely at random, with a high statistical probability that their talents and views would match those of the population at large. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This would be merely a modern version of the ancient Greek system of selection  by  lot.  As  E.  S.  Staveley  details  in  his  authoritative  history   <i class="calibre3">,</i> <i class="calibre3">Greek and Roman Voting</i> <i class="calibre3">and Elections</i>,  numerous  positions  in  Athens, from  the  magistrates  to  the  archons,  were  selected  by  sortition  as  a substitute  for  elections.  This  was  cleverly  accomplished,  in  spite  of mechanical limitations on the randomization of chances, through use of an  allotment  machine,  "or,  as  it  was  called  by  the  Athenians,  the <i class="calibre3">cleroterion</i>."10 A series of black and white beans were used as random counters  to  determine  who  would  be  selected  to  fill  various  offices,  as well as "to determine the order in which the tribal sections in the Council were to take their turns as  <i class="calibre3">plytaneis</i>." 11 The classic provenance of this idea may give it an extra measure of credibility. But its main appeal is precisely that it would avoid the drawbacks of self-selection in politics. It would statistically assure that fewer lawyers and egomaniacs engrossed the public's business. </p>

<p class="calibre1">419</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-421"></a>Legislatures  could  be  composed  of  true  representatives.  Since  they would not be brought together by the pursuit of power, and would have a negligible chance of being selected again by sortition in any event, they would be free to conduct the affairs of government and formulate policy on the basis of a rational analysis of the issues. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Today,  politicians  bent  on  optimizing  votes  have  little  incentive  to analyze problems coherently. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that their records  in  actually  solving  problems  are  so  pathetic  as  compared  to entrepreneurs, business executives, and coaches of sports teams, who are rewarded  according  to  performance.  Performance-based  compensation for legislators would not make everyone chosen at random as effective as Lee  Kuan  Yew.  But  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  performance would be greatly enhanced if the pay of legislators were keyed to some objective  measure  of  performance,  such  as  the  growth  of  after-tax  per capita income. Pay them on the basis of performance, and the chance that they would perform would increase a thousandfold. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The gain to society from policies that improve real income net of taxes could be huge. Why not pay prime ministers and presidents even a tiny share  of  the  gain  that  their  policies  promote?  The  funding  for  such payments  could  be  collected  by  a  small,  unobtrusive  tax.  Such  an arrangement  would  free  society  from  the  threat  it  now  faces  from ambitious  men  with  specialized  political  talent  like  Richard  Nixon  and Bill Clinton. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Messianic Personalities</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Too little attention has been paid to the fact that electoral politics lures disordered, messianic personalities into positions of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such persons existed, and often posed serious threats to social order even in  agrarian  societies  before  the  emergence  of  democratic  political systems.  Reviewing  the  careers  of  Eudo  de  Stell,  the  Breton  Christ, Adelbert  in  the  eighth  century,  Eon  in  the  eleventh,  Tanchelm  of Antwerp, Melchior Hoffman, and Bernt Rothmann and their ilk, several points  stand  out.  The  more  immediately  obvious  their  political  talents seem to be, the greater the damage they appear to have inflicted. Because the  state  was  not  yet  engaged  in  organizing  widespread  systematic coercion, these early protopoliticians frequently took it upon themselves to  rob  and  loot  in  order  to  obtain  cash  to  distribute  to  their  followers among the poor. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Protopoliticians in action</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">260</p>

<p class="calibre1">The stories of their antics give one the impression of talents out of time, like reading about seven-foot men running up and down a court before the  invention  of  basketball.  Today,  thanks  to  the  NBA,  freakishly  tall men  are  making  millions  dribbling  and  dunking.  If  basketball disappeared,  they  would  recede  again  into  the  crevices  of  society, probably appearing mostly as circus attractions and in sideshows. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Demagogues  before  politics  was  invented  were  drawn  to  the  nearest approximation  of  politics  the  agrarian  world  had  to  offer:  itinerant preaching.  They  harangued  crowds  and,  like  politicians,  eloquently promised a better life to those who would follow them. Then as now, the poor were the chief targets of demagogues. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Norman Cohn's great history of millenarian movements,  <i class="calibre3">The Pursuit of</i> <i class="calibre3">the  Millennium</i>,  recounts  the  careers  of  numerous  messianic  leaders before  polling.  It  is  easy  to  recognize  in  his  descriptions  the  strong 421</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-423"></a>similarities  in  personality  type  with  the  charismatic  politician  of  the modern period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">[T]he  leader  has-like  pharaoh  and  many  another  "divine  king"-all  the attributes of an ideal father: he is perfectly wise, he is perfectly just, he protects the weak. But on the other hand, he is also the son whose task is to transform the world, the Messiah who is to establish a new heaven and a  new  earth  and  who  can  say  of  himself:  "Behold,  I  make  all  things new!" And both as father and as son this figure is colossal, superhuman, Omnipotent. He is credited with such abundance of supernatural powers that it is imagined as streaming forth as light. . . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">Moreover  being  thus  filled  with  this  divine  spirit  the  eschatological leader  possesses  unique  miracle-working  powers.  His  armies  will  be invariably and triumphantly victorious. his presence will make the earth yield crops, his reign will be an age of such perfect harmony as the old, corrupt world has never known. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This image was of course a purely fantasic one, in the sense that it bore no relation to the real nature and capacity of any human being who ever existed or ever could exist. It was nevertheless an image which could be projected on to a living man; and there were always men about who were more than willing to accept such a projection, who in fact passionately desired  to  be  seen  as  infallible,  wonder-working  saviours.  .  .  .  And  the secret of the ascendancy which they exercised never lay in their birth nor to  any  great  extent  in  their  education,  but  always  in  their  personalities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Contemporary accounts of these messiahs of the poor commonly stress their  eloquence,  their  commanding  bearing  and  their  personal magnetism. Above all one gets the impression that even if some of these men  may  perhaps  have  been  conscious  impostors,  most  of  them  really saw themselves as incarnate gods. . . . And this total conviction would communicate itself easily enough to the multitudes whose deepest desire was precisely for an eschatological saviour. 13</p>

<p class="calibre1">While  this  passage  is  marvelously  concise  in  describing  the  would-be millenarian saviors who frequently unsettled medieval society, it cannot give  the  full  flavor  of  Cohn's  magisterial  survey.  One  cannot  read  the whole  work  without  recognizing  in  the  antics  of  these  prophetae  the familiar characteristics of the modern demagogue: the eloquence, 261</p>

<p class="calibre1">422</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-424"></a>"the  personal  magneticism,"  the  "messianic  pretensions,"  and  the recurring desire to be worshiped as tribune of the poor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The main difference that one discerns between the reception of medieval society to these impostors and that afforded by democracy at the end of the  twentieth  century  is  that  in  the  Middle  Ages  such  persons  were normally executed, whereas, at the end of the twentieth century, modern democratic  politics  provides  them  with  an  open  channel  by  which  to legitimately  seize  power  in  the  nationstate.  A  system  that  routinely submits control over the largest, most deadly enterprises on earth to the winner of popularity contests between charismatic demagogues is bound to suffer for it in the long run. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Pay Leaders to Do a Good Job</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">A  rational  selection  process,  combined  with  a  constructive  incentive structure  to  reward  positive  leadership,  would  bring  able  people  to  the helm  of  government.  It  would  also  mobilize  new  types  of  talent  who otherwise  would  not  normally  take  an  interest  in  the  problems  of governance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  most  talented  executives  in  the  world  could  be  attracted  to  run faltering governments if they could be paid on the basis of results they actually achieve for society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  leader  who  could  significantly  boost  real  income  in  any  leading Western nation could justly be paid far more than Michael Eisner. In a better  world,  every  successful  head  of  government  would  be  a multimillionaire. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Electronic Plebiscites</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  obvious  alternative  to  representative  misgovernment  would  be electronic plebiscites whereby citizens, perhaps a representative fraction selected  by  tamper-proof  sortition,  could  cast  their  ballots  directly  on legislative  proposals.  Computer  technology  allows  decisions  to  be determined democratically, with electronic plebiscites. Plebiscites could be  easily  combined  with  allotment  to  narrow  the  numbers  voting  on specific issues. </p>

<p class="calibre1">423</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-425"></a>In any event, in principle, it is far less challenging for would-be voters to understand  political  issues  than  to  attempt  to  fathom  politicians  and evaluate these politicians' </p>

<p class="calibre1">evaluations  of  the  same  issues,  much  less  know  what  those  politicians would actually do upon assuming office. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  particularly  difficult  in  that  politicians  and  their  handlers  are becoming increasingly proficient packaging and manipulating the images they present to the public. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We expect to see something new emerge to replace politics. While any of the possibilities we canvass above might be tried with some advantage, our expectation is not that politics will be reformed or improved, but that it will be antiquated and, in most 262</p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike dictatorship, or even democracy, commercialized sovereignty will not  foreclose  choice.  It  will  afford  every  individual  greater  scope  for expressing his views. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And  for  those  with  the  talent  to  take  advantage  of  it,  commercialized sovereignty  will  permit  more  practical  scope  for  decision-making  and self-determination  than  any  form  of  social  organization  that  has heretofore existed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Customized Government</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Lest this sound millenarian, consider that microtechnology miniaturizes and  disaggregates.  It  facilitates  customization  rather  than  mass production. You can now go into a store and purchase blue jeans that will be cut from a pattern customized to your measurements and sewn up half a  world  away.  When  new  institutions  at  last  evolve  to  fit  the  new megapolitical realities of the Information Age, you will be able to obtain governance at least as well customized to meet your personal needs and tastes as blue jeans. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Alvin  Toffler,  of  all  people,  has  criticized  the  idea  that  information technology could make citizens into customers. Toffler says, wrongly we believe, "That is far too narrow of a model. Whether we like it or not, there is a world of religion and feeling out there that cannot be simply reduced to contractual relationships." For reasons we explored earlier, we would  agree  that  it  will  be  difficult  to  "reduce  the  world  of  nationalist feeling" to "contractual relationships." But to say that is not to argue that 425</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-427"></a>it is impossible, much less that it would be a bad arrangement. A little less irrational gusto in nationalism could save millions of lives. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Entry, Exit" and "Voice" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  the  commercialization  of  sovereignty  is  an  unfamiliar concept,  apparently  even  to  Alvin  Toffler.  But  its  central  idea-the economic  mode  of  expression-is  commonplace  in  the  lives  of  people living  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century.  In  any  marginally  free economy,  consumers  can  act  to  express  their  desires  directly  by purchasing  services  and  products.  Or  by  withdrawing  their  custom. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When  you  become  dissatisfied  with  one  version  of  a  product  or  a provider  of  a  service,  you  can  directly  express  your  dissatisfaction  by means of "exit." In other words, you can shift your business elsewhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  last  chapter,  we  analyzed  how  the  advance  of  information technology  will  soon  make  it  feasible  for  you  to  create  assets  in cyberspace  that  will  be  all  but  immune  from  predatory  invasion  by nationstates.  This  will  create  a  de  facto  metaconstitutional  requirement that  governments  actually  provide  you  with  satisfactory  service  before you pay their bills. Why? Because income taxation will become almost as voluntary in fact as it is supposed to be in theory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">263</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Avoiding "Cumbrous Political Channels" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In effect, if information technology evolves as it may, it will assure that governments are actually controlled by their customers. As a customer, you  will  first  have  hundreds,  then  thousands  of  options  to  reduce  your protection  costs  directly  by  contracting  a  private  tax  treaty  with  a nationstate  or  by  defecting  from  nationstates  altogether  to  emerging minisovereignties. These contract "entry" and defection or "exit" </p>

<p class="calibre1">options are economic expressions of your desires as a customer. Voting with  your  feet  and  your  money  has  the  great  advantage  that  it  leads  to results that you desire. </p>

<p class="calibre1">How  do  your  "entry"  and  exit  options  as  a  customer  compare  with  the political  mode  of  expression  in  democracy?  Persons  who  become 426</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-428"></a>dissatisfied with some product or service, especially one provided by or heavily regulated by the government, can give "voice" to their views by writing letters to the president in the United States, or seeking a meeting with their member of Parliament or another appropriate elected official elsewhere.  Sometimes,  such  love  letters  work.  But  not  always.  Not usually. Failing success, at first, persons seeking to employ their "voice" </p>

<p class="calibre1">for  change  can  then  organize  a  demonstration,  take  out  a  full-page advertisement in a newspaper, or even seek elective office themselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  political  mode  of  expression  does  provide  a  channel  for  articulate statements and oratory. But it entails the drawback that you can seldom obtain satisfaction or improve your position by your own action. When faced  with  a  substandard  product  or  service  of  government,  you  are obliged  to  continue  paying  for  it  until  you  can  persuade  the  whole political process to accede to your request for a change. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  Western  countries,  and  now  in  practically  the  entire  earth,  this  has come to mean the necessity of securing majority support of a democratic political system. The requirement to involve a majority imposes massive transaction costs between you and achieving what in all likelihood is a relatively straightforward and rational goal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Milton Friedman discussed the merits of the economic, as opposed to the political,  mode  of  expression  in  advancing  his  proposal  for  school vouchers in  <i class="calibre3">Capitalism and</i> <i class="calibre3">Freedom</i>: Parents could express their views about schools directly, by withdrawing their children from one school and sending them to another, to a much greater  extent  than  is  now  possible.  In  general  they  can  now  take  this step only by changing their place of residence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For the rest, they can express their views only though cumbrous political channels.5 Albert 0. Hirschman, speaking as a partisan of politics, took exception  to  Friedman's  preference  for  "exit  as  the  'direct'  way  of expressing  one's  unfavorable  views  of  an  organization.  A  person  less well  trained  in  economics  might  naively  suggest  that  the  direct  way  of expressing one's views is to express them!" 16 Whether it is more direct or effective to express your opinions through market mechanisms, such 427</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-429"></a>as  providing  or  withdrawing  your  support  as  a  customer,  or  through</p>

<p class="calibre1">"cumbrous political channels" is a 264</p>

<p class="calibre1">complex  and  contentious  question.  Different  persons  will  answer  it  in different ways. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  those  whose  primary  engagement  with  political  expression  is  to demand benefits at the expense of others, shifting to the economic mode of  expression  may  indeed  seem  a  dismal  substitute  to  writing  to  a politician and demanding more. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Economic Expression and "Reciprocal Sociality" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">For those who intend to engage their fellows in "reciprocal" rather than</p>

<p class="calibre1">"coercive" </p>

<p class="calibre1">or  parasitic  sociality,  the  economic  mode  of  expression  opens  the prospect of achieving far greater satisfaction at a lower cost in time and trouble.  Professor  Hirschfield  notwithstanding,  this  is  easily demonstrated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Any  set  of  economic  expressions,  comprising  entry,  ongoing  contracts, and  exits,  could  be  converted  into  an  expression  of  political  "voice" </p>

<p class="calibre1">simply by involving multitudes of people in the decision-making. Try it as  an  experiment.  All  you  would  require  for  the  experiment  are  a  few hundred people who feel there is not enough politics in their lives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  spending  their  disposable  income  in  thousands  of  discrete purchases  over  a  year's  time,  they  would  convert  this  multitude  of economic decisions into a handful of political ones. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To start, all would agree to pool their disposable income and thereafter forgo purchases on an individual basis. Instead of thousands of dollars to spend individually in thousands of ways, everyone would get one vote or perhaps a few votes depending upon the number of offices to be filled. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rather than spending money directly to obtain what you want at any time you  wished,  you  would  spend  your  vote  or  votes  on  the  handful  of occasions when elections were held to select representatives who would then decide how the now gigantic collective purse would be spent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">428</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-430"></a>You, along with the others, would then share in the consumption of those items,  and  only  those  items  that  the  ruling  committee  approved  in  the name of the majority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Does that seem like a "cumbrous political channel" for expression yet? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Just wait. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  model  holds  all  the  potential  for  oratory  and  persuasion  that  one finds  in  politics  at  the  national  level.  And  most  of  the  potential  for frustration. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  example,  if  you  like  fresh  broccoli,  and  the  group  has  an  ordinary distribution of tastes in food, you are in trouble. Chances are that some or most of the others in your group would prefer to spend more of the common  food  allowance  on  red  meat  than  on  fresh  vegetables.  To prevent  the  canteen  committee  from  going  to  a  warehouse  store  and squandering the whole annual vegetable budget on canned peas and corn, you  might  have  to  step  forward  and  give  "voice"  to  your  views.  You could draw the group's attention to the relative merits of ingesting more vitamins  and  phytonutrients  like  sulforaphane  in  broccoli,  as  compared to more saturated fats and cholesterol from red meat. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Just  exactly  how  you  make  this  or  any  point  understood,  of  course, would be as much of a puzzle in this constructed political model as it is to  advocates  of  any  political  cause  or  candidacy.  You  could  give  a speech,  but  that,  of  course,  requires  that  a  good  fraction  of  the  group whom  you  need  to  persuade  is  already  assembled  somewhere  and prepared  to  listen.  You  could  print  up  flyers,  provided  that  such  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">"campaign 265</p>

<p class="calibre1">You could write letters. But both of these options depend upon the other participants being literate enough to read. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If your group in this model political exercise happened to be Americans, you  would  be  hard-pressed  to  get  any  persuasive  message  to  sink  in, particularly  if  the  members  of  the  group  were  similar  to  the  U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">electorate  as  a  whole.  The  perception  that  disproportionally  large numbers  of  citizens  of  the  world's  most  powerful  nationstate  are underachievers has been bleakly confirmed by the most thorough survey ever  undertaken  of  the  competence  of  American  adults.  The  study, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Adult  Literacy  in  America,"  shows  that  finding  a  literate  audience  for any political argument is by no means easy. A large fraction, perhaps a majority of Americans over the age of fifteen, lack basic skills essential to evaluating ideas and formulating judgments. According to the U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Education  Department,  90  million  Americans  cannot  write  a  letter, fathom  a  bus  schedule,  or  even  do  addition  and  subtraction  on  a calculator. This is about what you would expect if 90 million Americans were progressing through various stages of Alzheimer's Disease. Thirty million were judged so incompetent that they could not even respond to questions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">So  if  your  health  message  did  not  turn  the  tide,  which  is  otherwise finding  its  own  level,  then  you  could  call  for  help  from  animal  rights activists.  Perhaps  you  could  get  them  to  picket  your  opponents  in  the canteen committee or make a fuss about the evil of killing cows at the homes of influential members. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  example  could  be  extended  indefinitely,  which  is  probably  far longer  than  the  patience  of  rational  people  would  permit.  It  clearly demonstrates  that  (1)  any  economic  expression  of  entry  or  exit  can  be converted  into  a  political  expression  of  voice  by  making  it  a  collective decision; and (2) that collective decisions, in spite of the invitation they offer to eloquence, are, indeed, cumbrous and often intractable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  exactly  what  experience  has  shown.  It  is  far  from  easy  to mobilize  the  effort  required  to  change  the  course  of  a  democracy.  To 430</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-432"></a>reiterate,  that  may  well  be  the  reason  that  democratic  welfare  states survived  centuries  of  competition  with  alternative  methods  of government to predominate at the end of the industrial era. Democracy succeeded  as  a  political  system  precisely  because  its  operation  made  it difficult  for  customers  to  control  the  government  or  limit  the  state's claims on resources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However, since an unlimited partnership by the state in your affairs will no longer convey a military advantage in the Information Age, ingenious people  will  find  superior  ways  to  obtain  the  few  valuable  services  that governments  actually  provide.  It  is  likely  that  actual  power  will  be contracted out from collective mechanisms that no longer pay 266</p>

<p class="calibre1">their way. We expect to see efficiency predominate over massed power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As Neil Munro succinctly put it, "[I]t is computerized information, not manpower or mass production that increasingly drives the U.S. economy and that will win wars in a world wired for 500</p>

<p class="calibre1">TV  channels.  The  computerized  information  exists  in  cyberspace-the new  dimension  created  by  endless  reproduction  of  computer  networks, satellites, modems, databases and the public Internet." 17 Massed armies will  mean  little  in  such  a  world.  Efficiency  will  mean  more  than  ever before. Because microtechnology creates a new dimension in protection, as we explored in Chapter 6 and elsewhere, individuals for the first time in  human  existence  will  be  able  to  create  and  protect  assets  that  lie entirely  outside  the  realm  of  any  individual  government's  territorial monopoly on violence. These assets, therefore, will be highly susceptible to  individual  control.  It  will  be  perfectly  reasonable  for  you  and significant numbers of other future Sovereign Individuals to "vote with your feet" in opting out of leading nationstates to contract for personal protection  with  an  outlying  nationstate  or  a  new  minisovereignty  that will only charge a commercially tolerable amount, rather than the greater part of your net worth. In short, you would probably accept $50 million to move to Bermuda. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Exit First, Contract Later</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  early  stimulus  to  commercialization  of  sovereignty  will  have  to come  from  persons  expressing  themselves  economically  by  exit.  This 431</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-433"></a>option  will  be  most  difficult  in  the  United  States,  where  it  will  also  be most  valuable.  The  "Berlin  Wall"  for  capitalists  imposed  by  President Bill  Clinton  and  the  Republican  Congress  contradicts  the  slogan  so confidently expressed by American nationalists in the 1960s, "Love it or leave  it."  By  imposing  penal  taxes  on  those  who  leave,  the  exit  tax  is meant  to  compel  loyalty.  Yet  this  vindictive  legislation,  reminiscent  of the penalties imposed on fleeing property owners in the last days of the Roman Empire, may inadvertently set the framework for a more rational policy later in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At  some  point,  when  enough  able  persons  have  left  and  compounded sufficiently  large  fortunes  offshore,  it  will  become  appealing  to  U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">authorities to allow citizens or green card holders to buy their way out of future tax liabilities by paying an exit tax but not exiting. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  the  exit  tax  could  become  the  model  for  a  lump-sum buyout.  The  government  imposing  an  exit  tax  would  realize  far  higher benefits by allowing those exiting to resume residence under terms of a private treaty like those currently available in Switzerland and elsewhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Such moves on the part of the United States or other governments would be  rational  income-optimizing  gestures.  Eventually,  competition  in protection  services  will  force  down  tax  rates  and  adjust  the  terms  of taxation  to  more  civilized  standards.  Rather  than  depending  upon legislatures to enact acceptable tax regimes, Sovereign Individuals in the future will be able to negotiate acceptable, customized policy packages by private treaty. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  we  do  not  contend  for  a  moment  that  much  of  this  will  be popular. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  denationalization  of  the  individual  and  the  commercialization  of sovereignty it implies will offend remaining true believers in the cliches of twentiethcentury politics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like  the  late  Christopher  Lasch,  they  see  the  atrophy  of  politics  as  a threat to the wellbeing of a majority of the population. In their view, a revival  of  industrial-era  politics,  with  its  commitment  to  redistribute income,  could  be  a  solution  to  the  distresses  so  many  feel  with  the competitive pressures brought to bear by information technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">E.  J.  Dionne,  Jr.,  is  a  political  reporter  for  the  Washington  Post.  Like Lasch,  he  harks  back,  nostalgically,  to  politics.  He  also  speaks  for  a social democratic leveling impulse that is bound to find louder voice in the decades to come as the new megapolitical realities of the Information Age  more  decisively  undermine  institutions  left  over  from  the  modern world.  Dionne  sees  the  material  improvements  in  living  standards  that were widely shared within rich jurisdictions in the twentieth century as owing  mainly  to  democratic  politics  rather  than  to  technological  or economic development. His message is that hope for the future requires extending  the  dominion  of  politics  over  the  technologies  of  the Information  Age:  The  overriding  need  in  the  United  States  and throughout  the  democratic  world  is  for  a  new  engagement  with democratic  reform,  the  political  engine  that  made  the  industrial  era  as successful as it was. The technologies of the information age will not on their own construct a successful society, any more than industrialism left to  itself  would  have  made  the  world  better.  ...  Even  the  most extraordinary  breakthroughs  in  technology  and  the  most  ingenious applications  of  the  Internet  will  not  save  us  from  social  breakdown, crime or injustice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Only  politics,  which  is  the  art  of  how  we  organize  ourselves,  can  even begin  to  take  on  such  tasks."  Dionne  and  others  like  him  fail  to understand  that  the  conditions  that  made  twentiethcentury  life 433</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-435"></a>particularly conducive to systematic compulsion were not chosen by any human  agency.  The  "art  of  how  we  organize  ourselves"  is  a  statement that  would  not  have  been  intelligible  prior  to  the  modern  period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Societies are too complex to be rightly considered the fruit of any willful effort  of  self-organization.  The  nationstates  of  the  modern  period emerged  spontaneously  as  a  coincidental  by-product  of  industrial technology that raised returns to violence. Now information technology is reducing the returns to violence. This makes politics anachronistic and irretrievable,  no  matter  how  earnestly  people  might  wish  to  preserve  it into the next millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO" </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fervent  desire  to  "make  laws,"  which  seems  so  much  a  part  of  the common sense" of twentiethcentury politics, is by no means universal to all  cultures.  Its  disappearance  in  the  future  could  be  seen  as  part  of  a cycle that has waxed and waned 268</p>

<p class="calibre1">with  the  centuries.  For  example,  early  Greeks,  among  others,  believed that laws could not be made. In the words of philosopher Ernst Cassirer, the  Greeks  believed  "the  'unwritten  laws,'  the  laws  of  justice,  have  no beginning in time." 'Like other prepolitical peoples, they felt that no one could  improve  upon  the  natural,  "geometrical"  laws  of  justice  that  had not been created by any human power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They did not believe in a "lawgiver." As Cassirer put it, "It is by rational thought  that  we  are  to  find  the  standards  of  moral  conduct,  and  it  is reason,  and  reason  alone,  that  can  give  them  their  authority."  In  this sense,  any  attempt  to  impose  laws  upon  society  through  legislation would be like trying to alter geometry by legislation. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Legislation as Sacrilege</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">For very different reasons, a similar resistance to "lawmaking" prevailed through much of the medieval period. As John B. Morrall writes, "[F]or the  Germans,  law  was  something  which  had  existed  from  time immemorial." It was "a guarantee of the rights" </p>

<p class="calibre1">434</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-436"></a>of individual members of the tribe.20 Kings and councils had as yet no intention of creating new law. Such an intention would have been, from the point of view of these early medieval times, not only superfluous, but even  semi-blasphemous,  for  law,  like  kingship,  possessed  its  own sacrosanct  aura.  Instead,  king  and  councillors  thought  of  themselves  as merely explaining or clarifying the true meaning of the already existing and complete body of law. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Germanic custom handed on to the medieval mind an idea which it was never  able  to  forget,  even  when  in  practice  it  behaved  otherwise.  This idea  was  that  good  laws  were  rediscovered  or  restated  but  never remade.21  After  the  excesses  of  twentiethcentury  legislation,  there  is something  quaint  about  that  ancient  attitude.  The  desire  to  put  the coercive  power  of  the  state  to  work  for  private  ends,  particularly  the redistribution of income, became almost second nature. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Regrets</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Little wonder, then, that there are sad songs for politics in its last days. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  are  entirely  predictable.  And  not  only  because  they  reflect  the blindness  of  most  thinkers  to  the  imperatives  of  megapolitics.  Few political  reporters,  like  Dionne,  are  prepared  to  accept  the  apparent atrophy and demise of politics, when doing so might put them back on the  crime  beat.  At  the  end  of  the  Middle  Ages,  voices  were  raised  in support  of  reviving  chivalry.  Consider   <i class="calibre3">Ii  Libro  del  Cortegiano</i>,  or   <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Book of the Courtier</i>, written by Count Baldassare Castiglione in 1514, and published at Venice in 1528 by Aldus. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Castiglione's longing for a return to virtues of chivalry was deeply felt, but  longing  for  a  defunct  way  of  life  could  not  bring  it  back  in  the sixteenth century. Nor will it in the twenty-first century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  we  have  attempted  to  convey  in  explaining  our  theory  of megapolitics,  technological  imperatives,  not  popular  opinion,  are  the most important sources of change. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If our theory of megapolitics is valid, the reason the modern age, with its concept of 269</p>

<p class="calibre1">435</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-437"></a>citizenship and politics organized around the state, supplanted the feudal system  and  chivalry  organized  around  personal  oaths  and  relationships was  not  a  matter  of  ideas,  but  shifts  in  costs  and  benefits  arising  from new technology. Chivalry did not die because Castiglione or others failed to convince a disinterested populace who had any control over the matter that there was no need for honor or morality in the affairs of state. To the contrary,  Castiglione's  Courtier  is  critical  of  princes  and  the  kind  of behavior  his  contemporary,  Niccolo  Machiavelli,  commended  in  his   <i class="calibre3">Il</i> <i class="calibre3">Principe</i>, or  <i class="calibre3">The Prince</i>. But so what? Machiavelli ultimately reached a larger  audience  with  his  book,  not  because  his  argument  in  The  Prince was more eloquent but because his advice better suited the megapolitical conditions of the modern age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the distinguished twentiethcentury philosopher Ernst Cassirer said in discussing "The Moral Problem in Machiavelli," </p>

<p class="calibre1">The book describes, with complete indifference, the ways and means by which political power is to be acquired and maintained. About the right use of this power it does not say a word. ... No one had ever doubted that political life, as matters stand, is full of crimes, treacheries and felonies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  no  thinker  before  Machiavelli  had  undertaken  to  teach  the  art  of these  crimes.  These  things  were  done,  but  they  were  not  taught.  That Machiavelli promised to become a teacher in the art of craft, perfidy, and cruelty was a thing unheard of. 22</p>

<p class="calibre1">In short,  <i class="calibre3">The Prince</i> was a radical work that spelled out a modern recipe whereby an aspiring ruler could succeed in advancing his career at any cost to others. Machiavelli endorsed conduct that proved well suited to the nature of politics in an age of power. But the art of the double-cross, which  was  a  shrewd  policy  for  politicians  in  the  modern  era,  was outrageous  and  subversive  in  terms  of  the  culture  of  chivalry  that  had grown up in previous centuries. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As we explored earlier, the virtues of chivalry included an emphasis on extreme  fidelity  to  oaths.  This  was  a  necessity  in  a  society  where protection was organized in exchange for personal services. The bargains upon  which  feudal  society  rested  were  not  such  that  they  would  have reemerged  spontaneously  among  people  free  to  determine  where  their best  interests  lay  under  conditions  of  duress.  Therefore,  feudal 436</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-438"></a>commitments that were the basis of chivalry had to be shorn up with a strong  sense  of  honor.  In  that  context,  little  could  have  been  more subversive  than  Machiavelli's  suggestion  that  the  Prince  should  not hesitate to lie, cheat, and steal when so doing served his interests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the twentieth century drew to a close, Machiavelli's arguments were still  being  examined  for  their  importance  in  understanding  modern politics and various twentiethcentury crimes and tyrannies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Castiglione's  work,  by  contrast,  is  all  but  forgotten.  In  a  year's  time,  <i class="calibre3">Il</i> <i class="calibre3">Lihro del</i> <i class="calibre3">Cortegiano</i> may be read from cover to cover by a handful of literature  students  at  the  graduate  level  and  a  few  connoisseurs  of  the history of manners. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sometime  within  the  next  few  decades,  the  new  megapolitics  of  the Information  Age  will  antiquate   <i class="calibre3">The  Prince</i>.  The  Sovereign  Individual will require a new recipe for success, one which will highly emphasize honor and rectittude in deploying resources 270</p>

<p class="calibre1">outside the grip of the state. We can predict that such advice will not be read  with  pleasure  by  E.  J.  Dionne,  Jr.,  and  the  other  living  social democrats. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Policy Set by Customers</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  will  be  especially  true  early  in  the  transition,  when  most jurisdictions  will  still  be  lumbered  with  the  necessity  of  formulating policies  whose  advocates  can  attract  popular  assent  from  a  majority  of the  population.  Later,  as  democracy  fades  away  and  the  market  for sovereignty  services  deepens,  the  market  conditions  that  constrain</p>

<p class="calibre1">"policy" </p>

<p class="calibre1">will become more broadly understood. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What  we  now  think  of  as  "political"  leadership,  which  is  always conceived  in  terms  of  a  nationstate,  will  become  increasingly entrepreneurial  rather  than  political  in  nature.  In  these  conditions,  the viable range of choice in putting together a "policy" </p>

<p class="calibre1">437</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-439"></a>regime  for  a  jurisdiction  will  be  effectively  narrowed  in  the  same  way that the range of options open to entrepreneurs in designing a first-class resort hotel or any similar product or service is defined by what people will  pay  for.  A  resort  hotel,  for  example,  would  seldom  attempt  to operate on terms that required guests to perform hard labor to repair and extend  its  facilities.  Even  a  resort  hotel  owned  or  controlled  by  its employees, like the typical modern democracy, would try in vain to force customers  to  comply  with  such  demands,  especially  after  better accommodations  became  available.  If  the  customers  would  rather  play golf than do heavy labor in the hot sun, then on that question, at least, the market  offers  little  scope  for  imposing  arbitrary  alternatives.  In  such conditions,  presently  "political"  issues  will  recede  into  entrepreneurial judgments,  as  jurisdictions  seek  to  discover  what  policy  bundles  will attract customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Atrophy of Politics</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As this becomes understood, there will be a sea change in attitudes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Populations  in  devolving  jurisdictions  will  no  longer  expect  to  select from  the  same  range  of  wish-fulfilling  policy  options  that  engrossed political  debate  in  the  twentieth  century.  With  income-earning  capacity more highly skewed than in the industrial era, jurisdictions will tend to cater  to  the  needs  of  those  customers  whose  business  is  most  valuable and who have the greatest choice of where to bestow it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, it may matter much less than we are accustomed to  assume  whether  or  not  policies  that  are  commercially  optimal  for  a jurisdiction would appeal to the "median voter" in a focus group. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In short, the commercialization of sovereignty will facilitate the control of governments by their customers. This will tend to make the opinions of noncustomers irrelevant, or less relevant, just as the opinions of Big Mac  eaters  about   <i class="calibre3">foie  gras</i>  are  irrelevant  to  the  success  of  three-star French restaurants, like L'Arpege in Paris. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">"THE BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY" </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">271</p>

<p class="calibre1">438</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-440"></a>Like  the  late  Christopher  Lasch,  objectors  will  not  only  complain  that information  technology  destroys  jobs;  they  will  also  complain  that  it negates democracy because it allows individuals to place their resources outside  the  reach  of  political  compulsion.  For  this  reason,  the reactionaries  of  the  new  millennium  will  find  the  financial  privacy facilitated by information technology especially threatening. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They  will  recoil  from  the  prospect  that  income  and  capital  taxation would  truly  depend  upon  "voluntary  compliance."  They  will  support novel and even drastic means of squeezing resources out of anyone who appears  to  be  prosperous,  such  as  "presumptive  taxation"  and  outright holding of wealthy persons to ransom. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Community Property</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Hints of what is to come are near the surface as we write. Early evidence that  the  capacity  of  governments  to  control  international  markets  is slipping  away  offends  those  who  believe  that  individuals  are,  by  right, assets  of  nationstates.  They  want  to  enforce  their  ability  to  treat  the citizens  of  a  country  as  assets,  not  as  customers.  The  reactionaries believe that all income should be considered revenues of the community, meaning that it should be at the disposal of the state.23 We have already discussed arguments advanced by Lasch  <i class="calibre3">in Revolt of the Elites and the</i> <i class="calibre3">Betrayal of Democracy</i>. But his is not the only diatribe in support of the nationstate. Harvard University political theorist Michael Sandel argues in   <i class="calibre3">Democracy  in  Discontent</i>  that  "Democracy  today  is  not  possible without  a  politics  that  can  control  global  economic  forces,  because without  such  control  it  won't  matter  who  people  vote  for,  the corporations  will  rule."24  In  other  words,  the  state  must  retain  its parasitic  power  over  individuals,  in  order  to  assure  that  political outcomes  can  diverge  from  market  outcomes.  Otherwise  collective decisions to compel diseconomic outcomes would be meaningless. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  our  view,  Sandel's  lament,  like  that  of  Lasch,  is  no  more  than  half right.  We  concede  that  democracy  will  lose  much  of  its  importance  if governments  lack  the  power  to  compel  individuals  to  behave  as politicians  insist.  This  is  obvious.  Indeed,  democracy  as  it  has  been known in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is destined to disappear. </p>

<p class="calibre1">439</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-441"></a>But  Sandel  misses  the  real  importance  of  the  triumph  of  markets  over compulsion. His invocation of corporate rule" as a danger attendant upon the collapse of the nationstate is strikingly anachronistic. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Corporations will hardly be in a position to rule the markets of the new global economy. Indeed, as we have suggested, it is far from obvious that corporations  will  even  continue  to  exist  in  their  familiar  modern  form. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Far  from  it.  Firms  are  almost  bound  to  be  transformed  in  the megapolitical  revolution  that  comes  with  the  introduction  of  the Information Age. As we have previously discussed, microprocessing will alter the "information costs" that help determine the "nexus of contracts" </p>

<p class="calibre1">that  define  firms.  As  economists  Michael  C.  Jensen  and  William  H. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Meckling suggest, corporations are merely one legal form that provides</p>

<p class="calibre1">"a  nexus  for  a  set  of  contracting  relationships  among  individuals."  25</p>

<p class="calibre1">Whether the corporation can even survive, much less "rule" as "a domain of  bureaucratic  direction  that  is  shielded  from  market  forces,"  is  itself likely to be 272</p>

<p class="calibre1">determined, in the words of economists Louis Putterman and Randall S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kroszncr,  by  "the  completeness  of  market  forces  and  the  ability  of market  forces  to  penetrate  intrafirm  relationships."26  As  we  argued earlier,  it  is  doubtful  that  firms  will  be  able  to  survive  the  increasing penetration  of  market  forces  into  what  have  heretofore  been  "intrafirm relationships."  As  a  result,  firms  will  tend  to  dissolve  as  information technology makes it more rewarding to rely upon the price mechanism and  the  auction  market  to  undertake  tasks  that  need  doing  rather  than having them internalized within a formal organization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  information  technology  increasingly  automates  the  production process, it will take away part of the raison d 'etre of the firm, the need to employ and motivate managers to monitor individual workers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Why Are There Firms?" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Remember, the question "Why are there firms?" is not as trivial as it may seem on casual observation. Microeconomics generally assumes that the price  mechanism  is  the  most  effective  means  of  coordinating  resources for  their  most  valued  uses.  As  Putterman  and  Kroszner  observe,  this tends to imply that organizations like firms have no inherent "economic 440</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-442"></a>raison d'etre."27 In this sense, firms are mainly artifacts of information and  transaction  costs,  which  information  technologies  tend  to  reduce drastically. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  Information  Age  will  tend  to  be  the  age  of  independent contractors  without  "jobs"  with  long-lasting  "firms."  As  technology lowers transaction costs, the very process that will enable individuals to escape  from  domination  by  politicians  will  also  prevent  "rule  by corporations." Corporations will compete with "virtual corporations" </p>

<p class="calibre1">from across the globe to a degree that will disturb and threaten all but a few. Most corporations as institutions will be lucky to survive intensified competition as markets become more complete. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  consequence  to  be  expected  is  not  that  individuals  will  be  at  the mercy of corporations. To the contrary. Corporations, per se, will have no more  power  to  rig  markets  than  politicians.  It  is  rather  that  individuals will  finally  be  free  to  determine  their  own  destinies  in  a  truly  free market, ruled neither by big governments nor corporate hierarchies. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  erosion  of  transaction  costs  will  also  put  the  lie  to  recently fashionable  notions  of  "stakeholder  capitalism."  Such  notions,  dear  to Tony Blair of Britain's Labour Party as well as some within Bill Clinton's entourage, are predicated upon the ability of the state to manipulate the corporation.  Socialism  having  collapsed,  interventionists  now  dream  of achieving the ends of socialism through more market-efficient means by heavily regulating the firm. This new redistributive theory holds that the management,  shareholders,  employees,  and  "community"  are  all</p>

<p class="calibre1">"stakeholders"  of  firms.  The  argument  is  that  they  all  derive  benefits from long-lasting firms, and even depend upon these benefits. Therefore, regulation  ought  to  protect  the  stakes  that  managers,  employees,  and local taxing authorities have in the continuation of their historic relations with the firms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Stakeholder  capitalism"  is  a  doctrine  that  ultimately  presupposes  not only  an  ability  of  the  state  to  manipulate  the  decision-making  of corporations, but even more 273</p>

<p class="calibre1">441</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-443"></a>basically  presupposes  the  existence  of  corporations  as  longstanding organizations  capable  of  functioning  independently  of  price  signals  in the auction market. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  suspect  that  the  deepening  of  markets  will  not  only  diminish  the taxing  capacity  of  the  nationstate,  it  will  also  erode  the  capacity  of politicians to impose their will arbitrarily upon the owners of resources by regulation. In a world where jurisdictional advantages will be subject to  market  tests,  and  many  local  markets  will  be  opened  to  competition from anywhere, it is hardly to be expected that local "communities" will have  many  effective  ways  of  isolating  favored  firms  from  global competitive  pressures.  Therefore,  they  will  have  few  ways  of  assuring that  corporations  lumbered  with  higher  costs  (for  example,  to  retain unnecessary employees and management personnel, and keep unneeded facilities open to accommodate local political pressures) will be able to offset those costs and stay in business. In the Industrial Age, politicians could  close  markets  and  restrict  entry  to  a  few  favored  firms  to  meet employment and other objectives. In the future, when information will be freely  tradable  anywhere  on  the  globe,  the  power  of  governments  to insulate  local  businesses  from  global  competitive  pressures  will  be minimal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Neither is it likely that calls for a "new social contract" focused on a so-called  independent  or  volunteer  sector  to  absorb  the  time  of  otherwise unemployed  or  marginalized  workers  "in  the  community"  will  prove viable.28  Jeremy  Ritkin  imagines  "a  new  partnership  between  the government  and  the  third  sector  to  rebuild  the  social  economy.  ... </p>

<p class="calibre1">Feeding  the  poor,  providing  basic  health  care  services,  educating  the nation's  youth,  building  affordable  housing  and  preserving  the environment." 29</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Eclipse of Public Goods</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, the apologists for coercion will argue that the waning of state power will lead to an inability to procure or enjoy public goods. This is unlikely,  both  for  competitive  and  other  reasons.  For  one  thing,  with locational advantages mostly dissipated by technology, jurisdictions that fail  to  provide  essential  public  goods,  such  as  maintenance  of  law  and order, will rapidly lose customers. In the most extreme failures, such as 442</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-444"></a>those  already  evidenced  in  Somalia,  Liberia,  Rwanda,  and  the  former Yugoslavia, hordes of penniless refugees are likely to spill over borders seeking more satisfactory provision of law and order. But these extreme examples of desertion, or voting with one's feet, will differ only by their urgency from straightforward jurisdictional shopping. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In any event, corporations will force local jurisdictions to meet the needs of their customers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">"Competitive Territorial Clubs" </b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This  is  more  than  merely  a  theory,  as  articulated  first  by  economist Charles Tiebout in 1956.30 As economist Fred Foldvary has documented in  Public  Goods  and  Private  Communities:  The  Market  Provision  of Social Services, there is no essential reason that social services and many public goods must be provided by political means. </p>

<p class="calibre1">274</p>

<p class="calibre1">Foldvary's  examples,  among  others,  also  confirm  the  controversial theorem  of  Nobel  Prize~winning  economist  Ronald  Coase  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"government  intervention  is  not  needed  to  resolve  externality  issues," </p>

<p class="calibre1">such  as  problems  of  pollution.31  Entrepreneurs  can  provide  collective goods  by  market  means.  Many  already  do  so  now  in  real  world communities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Foldvary's case studies show how the privatization of communities can result in new mechanisms for providing and financing public goods and services.32</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Road to Prosperity</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Microtechnology  itself  will  facilitate  new  means  of  financing  and regulating the provision of goods heretofore treated as public goods. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In retrospect, some of these goods will prove to have been private goods in  disguise.  Highways  represent  a  key  example.  So  long  as  congestion was  a  minor  problem,  roads  and  highways  could  be  treated  as  if  they were  public  goods,  albeit  subject  to  the  criticisms  leveled  by  Adam Smith  that  they  disproportionally  benefit  those  living  nearby  at  the 443</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-445"></a>expense  of  those  in  remote  regions  who  are  dragooned  into  paying  for them while enjoying few of the benefits. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  it  will  be  technologically  feasible  to  impose tolls, including congestion fees, that accurately price access to highways, runways, and other infrastructure without interrupting traffic flow. Thus the provision transportation infrastructure could be discretely privatized and  financed  directly  by  those  who  use  the  service.  Economist  Paul Krugman  estimates  that  market  pricing  of  U.S.  transportation infrastructure  would  add  from  $60  billion  to  $100  billion  annually  to CIDP  in  the  United  States,  while  improving  the  efficiency  of  resource use and reducing pollution.33</p>

<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  it  is  not  to  be  forgotten  that  the  most  costly  part  of  what modern  nationstates  do-redistributing  income-is  not  the  provision  of  a public good at all, but the provision of private goods at public expense. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Public expense" here is a euphemism for "at the expense of those who pay  the  taxes."  What  of  a  genuine  public  good,  like  the  provision  of  a military force capable of deterring attack by a great power? Such a force has  traditionally  been  expensive.  Obviously,  as  we  have  already explored, a government that lacks an unchecked ability to confiscate the incomes  and  property  of  its  citizens  would  be  unable  to  finance participation in another great power conflict like World War II. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  this  fiscal  limit  poses  less  of  a  threat  than  the  reactionaries  will pretend,  for  the  simple  reason  that  there  will  be  no  more  conflicts  like World War II. The very technology that is liberating individuals will see to that. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Up from Politics</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Instead of leaving the quality and character of such services to the mercy of  politics,  "governments"  can  be  run  entrepreneurially  and  converted into  what  Foldvary  describes  as  "competitive  territorial  clubs."  We suspect that ultimately, the decision-275</p>

<p class="calibre1">TANZI We believe that as the modern nationstate decomposes, latter-day barbarians  will  increasingly  come  to  exercise  real  power  behind  the scenes.  Groups  like  the  Russian  mafiyas  that  pick  the  bones  of  the former  Soviet  Union,  other  ethnic  criminal  gangs,  nomenklaturas,  drug lords,  and  renegade  covert  agencies  will  increasingly  be  laws  unto themselves.  They  already  are.  Far  more  than  is  widely  understood,  the modem  barbarians  have  already  infiltrated  the  forms  of  the  nationstate without  greatly  changing  its  appearances.  They  are  microparasites feeding on a dying system. As violent and unscrupulous as a state at war, these groups employ the techniques of the state on a smaller scale. Their growing influence and power is part of the downsizing of politics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Microprocessing reduces the size that groups must attain in order to be effective  in  the  use  and  control  of  violence.  As  this  technological revolution unfolds, predatory violence will be organized more and more outside of central control. Efforts to contain violence will also devolve in ways that depend more upon efficiency than magnitude of power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The surge of covert criminal activity and corruption within nationstates will form an important subplot as the world changes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What you will see could be a covert and sinister version of a bad movie, <i class="calibre3">Invasion</i> <i class="calibre3">of the Body Snatchers</i>. Before most nationstates visibly collapse they will be dominated by latter-day barbarians. As often as not, as in the famous B-movie from the 1950s, they will be barbarians in disguise. The 446</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-448"></a>Pod  People  of  the  future,  however,  will  not  be  aliens  from  space  but criminals of various affiliations who fill official positions while owing at least partial allegiance outside the constitutional order. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The end of an era is usually a period of intense corruption. As the bonds of the old system dissolve, the social ethos dissolves with it, creating an environment  in  which  people  in  high  places  may  combine  public purposes with private criminal activity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">277</p>

<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, you will not be able to depend upon normal information channels to give you an accurate and timely understanding of the decay of the nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Persistent  make-believe"  of  the  kind  that  disguised  the  fall  of  the Roman  Empire  is  probably  a  typical  feature  of  the  decomposition  of large  political  entities.  It  now  disguises  and  masks  the  collapse  of  the nationstate.  For  a  variety  of  reasons,  the  news  media  cannot  always  be depended upon to tell you the truth. Many are conservative in the sense that  they  represent  the  party  of  the  past.  Some  are  blinded  by anachronistic ideological commitments to socialism and the nationstate. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some  will  be  afraid  for  more  tangible  reasons  to  reveal  the  corruption that  is  likely  to  loom  ever  larger  in  a  decaying  system.  Some  will  lack physical courage that might be required for such a task. Others will fear for  their  jobs  or  be  shy  of  other  retribution  for  speaking  up.  And,  of course,  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  reporters  and  editors  are  any less  prone  to  corrupt  consideration  than  building  inspectors  or  Italian paving contractors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To  a  larger  extent  than  you  might  expect,  important  organs  of information that appear to be keen to report anything and everything may prove  to  be  less  dependable  information  sources  than  is  commonly supposed.  Many  will  have  other  motivations,  including  shoring  up support  for  a  faltering  system,  that  they  will  place  ahead  of  honestly informing you. They will see little and explain less. </p>

<p class="calibre1">447</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-449"></a><b class="calibre4">BEYOND REALITY</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">As  artificial  reality  and  computer  game  technologies  continue  to improve, you'll even be able to order a nightly news report that simulates the  news  you  would  like  to  hear.  Want  to  watch  a  report  showing yourself as the winner of the decathlon at the Olympics? No problem. It could  be  tomorrow's  lead  story.  You'll  see  any  story  you  wish,  true  or false, unfold on your television/computer with greater verisimilitude than anything that NBC or the BBC can now muster. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  are  rapidly  moving  to  a  world  where  information  will  be  as completely liberated from the bounds of reality as human ingenuity can make it. Certainly, this will have tremendous implications for the quality and  character  of  the  information  you  receive.  In  a  world  of  artificial reality  and  instantaneous  transmission  of  everything  everywhere, integrity of judgment and the ability to distinguish the true from the false will be even more important. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  this  will  be  less  of  a  change  from  our  current  circumstances  than many people would imagine. The distinctions between true and false are commonly blurred for reasons that have been amplified by technology. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  say  this  recognizing  that  many  of  the  consequences  of  the Information Revolution have been liberating. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technology  has  already  begun  to  transcend  geographic  proximity  and political domination. Governments can erect barriers to hinder the trade in  goods,  but  they  can  do  much  less  to  halt  the  transmission  of information.  Almost  every  diner  at  any  restaurant  in  Hong  Kong  is connected by cellular phone to the whole globe. The hard-line coup 278</p>

<p class="calibre1">plotters  in  Moscow  in  August  1991  could  not  shut  down  Yeltsin's communications because he had cellular phones. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">More Information, Less Understanding</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">As the barriers to transmission of information have fallen, there has been more of it, which is good. But there has also been more confusion about 448</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-450"></a>what  it  means.  The  modern  technology  that  helps  liberate  information from political controls and impediments of time and place also tends to raise the value of old-fashioned judgment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The kind of insight that helps discern what is important and true from the mountain of facts and fantasies is growing in value almost daily. This is true  for  at  least  three  reasons:  1.  The  very  glut  of  information  now available puts a premium on brevity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise as possible.  Unfortunately,  abbreviated  information  often  provides  a  poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five-second sound-bites  and  misconstrued  on  CNN.  It  is  much  easier  to  convey  a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket  score  much  more  easily  than  you  can  explain  how  baseball  or cricket is played and what it means. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2.  Rapidly  changing  technology  is  undermining  the  megapolitical  basis of  social  and  economic  organization.  As  a  consequence,  broad paradigmatic  understanding,  or  unspoken  theories  about  the  way  the world  works,  are  being  antiquated  more  quickly  than  in  the  past.  This increases the importance of the broad overview and diminishes the value of  individual  "facts"  of  the  kind  that  are  readily  available  to  almost anyone with an information retrieval system. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3.  The  growing  tribalization  and  marginalization  of  life  have  had  a stunting  effect  on  discourse,  and  even  on  thinking.  Many  people  have consequently gotten into the habit of shying away from conclusions that are obviously implied by the facts at their disposal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A recent psychological study disguised as a public opinion poll showed that members of individual occupational groups were almost uniformly unwilling  to  accept  any  conclusion  that  implied  a  loss  of  income  for them, no matter how airtight the logic supporting it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">449</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-451"></a>Given  increased  specialization,  most  of  the  interpretive  information about  most  specialized  occupational  groups  is  designed  to  cater  to  the interests of the groups themselves. They have little interest in views that might  be  impolite,  unprofitable,  or  politically  incorrect.  There  is  no better  example  of  this  general  tendency  than  the  broad  drumbeat  of views implying bright prospects for investing in the stock market. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most of that information is generated by brokerage firms, few of which will  tell  you  that  stocks  are  overvalued.  Their  income  is  derived  from transaction  business  that  depends  on  the  majority  of  customers  being ready to buy. Independent, contrary voices are seldom heard. </p>

<p class="calibre1">279</p>

<p class="calibre1">For these and other reasons, the Age of Information has not yet become the Age of Understanding. To the contrary, there has been a sharp drop-off  in  the  rigor  of  public  discourse.  The  world  now  could  know  more than at any time in the past. But there is almost no public voice left to assess the meaning of events and say what is true. This is why we have been fascinated to see the tepid interest, particularly in the U.S. media, in reporting  hints  of  sensational  corruption  at  high  levels  of  the  U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">government. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  central  theme  we  have  wrestled  with  in  this  book  is  how  changing technology and other "megapolitical" factors alter the "natural economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  "natural  economy"  is  the  Darwinian  "state  of  nature"  where outcomes  are  determined,  sometimes  unfairly,  by  physical  force.  In  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">"natural  economy,"  an  important  strand  of  behavior  is  what  biologists call "interference competition." </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Interference Competition</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">"Interference competitors," as Jack Hirshleifer put it, "gain and maintain control  over  resources  by  directly  fighting  off  or  hampering  their rivals."2 However much we may wish that human behavior were always subject to the rule of law and "other socially enforced rules of the game" </p>

<p class="calibre1">("political economy"), there is ample evidence that many people "play by the rules" only when it suits them. Hirshleifer, an authority on conflict, put it this way: "[T]he persistence of crime, war and politics teaches us 450</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-452"></a>that  actual  human  affairs  still  remain  largely  subject  to  the  underlying pressures of natural economy." 3 In other words, economic outcomes are determined only partly by the peaceful and law-abiding behavior of the <i class="calibre3">Homo  economicus</i>  described  in  textbooks,  who  honor  property  rights</p>

<p class="calibre1">"and  will  not  simply  take  what  does  not  belong  to  them."4  Actual outcomes  are  also  shaped  by  conflict,  including  overt  violence.  As economist Hirshleifer points out, "Even under law and government, the rational,  self-interested  individual  will  strike  a  balance  between  lawful and  unlawful  means  of  acquiring  resources-between  production  and exchange on the one hand and theft, fraud and extortion on the other." 5</p>

<p class="calibre1">451</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-453"></a><b class="calibre4">MUGGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Michelle  R.  Garfinkel  and  Stergios  Skaperdas  explore  this  in  a  useful book on violence, crime, and politics,  <i class="calibre3">The Political Economy of Conflict</i> <i class="calibre3">and Appropriation</i>: "Individuals and groups can either produce and thus create wealth or seize the wealth created by others." 6 They quote a tale of  modern  interference  competition  originally  reported  by  the Economist.' "An American businessman, recently arrived in Moscow to open  an  office,  was  met  at  his  hotel  by  five  men  with  gold  watches, pistols  and  a  printout  of  his  firm's  net  worth.  They  demanded  7%  of future earnings. He took the first flight to New York, where muggers are less sophisticated." 7 This tale of mugging in the Information Age owes more  to  new  technology  than  the  simple  fact  that  thugs  in  Russia  now have  access  to  financial  profiles  and  credit  reports  on  their  victims through the Internet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">280</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Falling Decisiveness of Military Power</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">For good and for ill, by making large-scale military power less decisive, information  technology  has  radically  reduced  the  capacity  of  the nationstate to impose its authority in an unruly world. If once, as Voltaire said, “God was on the side of bigger battalions," there appears to be less divine support with every day that passes for generating large returns to violence.  Instead,  we  see  the  opposite-more  evidence  of  diminishing returns  to  violence-which  strongly  implies  that  large  conglomerations like the nationstate will no longer justify their huge overhead costs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The most obvious evidence of the declining decisiveness of centralized power is the rise of terrorism. High-profile bombings in the United States in the mid-nineties show that even the world's military superpower is not immune from attack. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Another  important  manifestation  of  falling  returns  to  violence  is  the worldwide  growth  of  gangsterism  and  organized  crime,  along  with  its corollary,  political  cronyism  and  corruption.  They  reflect  a  generally amoral atmosphere in which the state can coerce but not protect. As its 452</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-454"></a>monopoly  of  violence  frays,  new  competitors  edge  into  the  scene,  like the  bully-boys  who  tried  to  impose  their  own  private  taxes  on  the American businessman in Moscow. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Small groups, tribes, triads, gangs, gangsters, mafias, militias, and even solitary  individuals  have  gained  increasing  military  effectiveness.  They will  exercise  far  more  real  power  in  the  "natural  economy"  of  the  next millennium than they did in the twentieth century. Weapons that employ microchips have tended to shift the balance of power toward the defense, making decisive aggression less profitable and therefore less likely. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Smart weapons, like Stinger missiles, for example, effectively neutralize much  of  the  advantage  that  large,  wealthy  states  formerly  enjoyed  in deploying expensive air power to attack poorer, smaller groups. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Information War Ahead</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Looming ahead is the widely discussed but little-understood possibility of  "Information  War."  It  also  points  to  diminishing  returns  to  violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Logic bombs" </p>

<p class="calibre1">could  disable  or  sabotage  air-traffic  control  systems,  rail-switching mechanisms,  power  generators  and  distribution  networks,  water  and sewage  systems,  telephone  relays,  even  the  military's  own communications.  As  societies  become  more  dependent  upon computerized controls, "logic bombs" could do almost as much damage as physical explosions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unlike conventional bombs, "logic bombs" could be detonated remotely, not  just  by  hostile  governments  but  by  groups  of  freelance  computer programmers,  and  even  talented  individual  hackers.  Note  that  an Argentine  teenager  was  arrested  in  1996  for  repeatedly  hacking  into Pentagon  computers.  While  to  date  hackers  have  not  tended  to  tamper with computer-controlled systems in destructive ways, this is not because there are truly effective ways of stopping them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">281</p>

<p class="calibre1">When  the  age  of  Information  War  finally  arrives,  it  is  unlikely  that  its antagonists  will  only  be  governments.  A  company  like  Microsoft 453</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-455"></a>certainly has a greater ability to conduct Information War than 90 percent of the world's nationstates. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Age of the Sovereign Individual</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">This is part of the reason why we have entitled this book  <i class="calibre3">The Sovereign</i> <i class="calibre3">Individual</i>. As the scale of warfare falls, defense and protection will be mounted at a smaller scale. Therefore, they will increasingly be private rather  than  public  goods,  provided  on  a  for-profit  basis  by  private contractors.  This  is  already  evident  in  the  privatization  of  policing  in North  America.  One  of  the  more  rapidly  growing  occupations  in  the United  States  is  the  "security  guard."  Projections  indicate  that  the number of private security guards will increase 24 percent to 40 percent above  1990  levels  by  the  year  2005.6  The  privatization  of  policing  is already  a  well-defined  trend.  Yet  as  Anglo-Irish  guru  Hamish  McRae points  out,  this  is  hardly  the  result  of  any  deliberate  decision  of government. He writes in  <i class="calibre3">The World in 2020</i>: No government has made a specific  decision  to  move  out  of  some  policing  tasks,  nor  indeed,  have any moved out; the private sector has moved in. Partly as a result of the perceived  failures  of  the  police,  partly  as  a  result  of  other  changes  in society, private security firms have gradually been taking over much of the  job  of  protecting  ordinary  civilians  in  their  offices  or  shopping centres. As the gated communities of Los Angeles show, people are even moving  some  way  back  towards  the  medieval  concept  of  a  city,  where the citizens live behind town walls patrolled by guards, and where access is possible only at controlled gates.9</p>

<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  this  is  only  a  foretaste  of  more  comprehensive privatization of almost every function undertaken by governments in the twentieth  century.  Because  information  technology  has  undermined  the capacity  of  centralized  authority  to  project  power  and  provide  physical security  for  systems  that  operate  at  a  large  scale,  the  optimal  size  of almost every enterprise in the "natural economy" is falling. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To respond to this technological change will entail a massive investment requirement  (read  opportunity)  to  redesign  vulnerable  systems  with distributed  rather  than  concentrated  capabilities.  If  vulnerabilities  of large scale are not removed, the systems that retain them will be subject to catastrophic failure. </p>

<p class="calibre1">454</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-456"></a>Sooner  or  later,  by  default  if  not  by  design,  services  and  products provided  by  large  bureaucratic  agencies  and  corporations  will  devolve into highly competitive markets, managed not from a 'headquarters" but through a distributed, decentralized network. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The corporation with a headquarters that can be surrounded by pickets or sabotaged  by  terrorists  will  be  vulnerable  until  it  ultimately  becomes  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">"virtual  corporation"  without  a  location,  "dwelling  in  many  places concurrently," as Kevin Kelly, executive editor of  <i class="calibre3">Wired</i> magazine writes in  <i class="calibre3">Out Of Control</i>"' Kelly understands that 282</p>

<p class="calibre1">technology  has  changed  the  imperative  to  bring  production  processes under centralized control. "For most of the industrial revolution, serious wealth was made by bringing processes under one roof. Bigger was more efficient." Now it isn't. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kelly  foresees  the  possibility  that  an  automobile  of  the  future,  the Upstart Car, could be designed and brought to production by as few as a dozen people collaborating in a virtual corporation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  the  future,  excessive  scale  could  be  not  only  counterproductive  but dangerous. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Larger  enterprises  make  more  tempting  targets.  As  practitioners  of  the underground  economy  demonstrate,  one  of  the  secrets  of  avoiding taxation is to avoid detection. This will be much easier for small-scale, </p>

<p class="calibre1">"virtual  corporations"  than  old-line  corporations  operating  out  of  a skyscraper headquarters with their names in lights. They are bound to be more vulnerable to the attentions of "men with gold watches, pistols and a printout of the firm's net worth," the gangsters who will impose their own  private  brand  of  taxation  in  other  parts  of  the  globe  as  they  do  in Russia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As the monopoly on violence enjoyed by the "bigger battalions" breaks down, one of the first results to be expected is increasing prosperity for organized  crime.  Organized  crime,  after  all,  provides  the  main competition  to  nationstates  in  employing  violence  for  predatory purposes. Although it is impolite to say so, it should not be forgotten, as political scientist Charles Tilly reminds us, that governments themselves-</p>

It  is  therefore  not  a  coincidence  that  drug  cartels,  gangs,  mafias, and tri ads of various sorts are proliferating around the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Sistema del Potere</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">From Russia to Japan to the United States, organized crime is a far more important factor in the operation of economies than economic textbooks would  prepare  you  to  believe.  What  the  Sicilians  call  the  "sistema  del potere,'  the  "system  of  power,"  of  organized  crime  has  an  increasingly important role to play in determining how economies function. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Drug  traffickers  have  also  played  a  key  role  in  financing  recent  civil wars and insurgencies in other parts of the globe. Julio Fernandez, chief of the Spanish national police drug squad in Catalonia, says, "From 1986</p>

<p class="calibre1">As soon as we destroyed that network with arrests, it was replaced with Kurds  from  Turkey,  who  completely  dominated  it  for  the  next  two years." '3</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-458"></a>Chances are, whenever a new civil war or insurgency gets under way, the desperately  poor  combatants  will  finance  their  military  effort  by delivering drugs and laundering drug money. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Drug-Financed Discounting</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Organized criminal syndicate activities have placed downward pressures on  prices  of  commodities  other  than  drugs.  At  the  micro  level,  crime syndicates subsidize apparently legitimate businesses from the spoils of criminal enterprise. They can launder drug profits and other illicit funds by  selling  ordinary  goods  below  cost,  thus  undercutting  the  prices  of their clean competitors and putting many out of business. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Yakuza Deflation</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  Japan,  the  powerful  Yakuza  gangs  played  a  key  role  in  Japan's hyperactive real estate bubble of the late 1980s. In spite of the fact that ninety  thousand  Yakuza  make  somewhere  between  $10.19  billion (official  estimate)  and  $71.35  billion  (estimate  of  Professor  Takatsugu Nato)  annually,  a  high  proportion  of  the  uncollectable  loans  that  have threatened the solvency of Japan '5 banks were made to Yakuza-backed deals.'4 The deflation pressures-"price destruction," as the Japanese call it-that have characterized Japan's economy are a consequence. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">A Blind Eye</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Russia's  mafiyas,  as  Yeltsin  himself  has  admitted,  have  merged  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">"commercial structures, administrative agencies, interior ministry bodies, city authorities . ." '~</p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  of  the  immunity  the  mafiyas  have  achieved  by  merging  with police, they are able to enforce collection of their private taxes through blatant violence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Authoritative sources indicate that four of five Russian businesses now pay  protection  money.  "According  to  some  reports,  local  small businesses  in  Russia  have  to  pay  30  to  50  percent  of  their  profits  to racketeers, not just the meager 7 percent demanded from the American businessman." 16 In 1993 there were 355,500 crimes in Russia officially designated as examples of "racketeering," including almost "30,000</p>

<p class="calibre1">457</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-459"></a>284</p>

<p class="calibre1">premeditated murders," mostly gangland assassinations of businessmen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">According to a former interior minister, General Viktor Yerin, "The bulk were contract killings, because of conflicts in the sphere of commercial and  financial  activity."  In  most  cases,  authorities  turned  "a  blind  eye." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Criminal  organizations  "through  their  control  over  coercion  and corruption," as economists Gianluca Fiorentini and Sam Peltzman write in  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Economics of Organized Crime</i>, play a key role in the economy.'7</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  theory,  this  influence  can  sometimes  be  beneficial  because  it constrains regulation and may encourage governments to improve their delivery of public goods. The presence of a powerful mafia "constrains the monopolistic role of government authorities." 8</p>

<p class="calibre1">Governments  in  territories  with  powerful  organized  crime  groups  can only with great difficulty entertain policies that the mafias oppose. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Collusion</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  it  is  notable  how  infrequently  most  governments  are  willing  to directly confront the mafias that are their main competitors in the use of organized coercion. In strictly economic terms this is not surprising. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The most profitable arrangement that "the elected members of the public administration"  can  strike  is  a  "collusive  agreement"  with  organized crime.  Fiorentini  and  Peltzman  note  that  "there  has  been  evidence  of large-scale  agreements  where  organized  crime  ensures  political  support for  groups  of  candidates,  while  the  latter  repay  the  favor  through  a favorable  management  of  public  procurements  and  the  provision  of public  services  or  subsidies."  Contrary  to  the  impression  conveyed  by Hollywood, penetrating and defrauding governments now appears to be one of the main focuses of criminal organizations like the Sicilian mafia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Most  scholars  think  that  by  now  the  greatest  business  of  the  Sicilian mafia  is  precisely  that  of  appropriating  the  different  sources  of  public expenditures  and  of  organizing  frauds  against  the  local,  national  and European Community schemes of subsidization." 20</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-460"></a>As we warned in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, many governments in the world are  thoroughly  corrupted  by  drug  lords.  Mexico  is  an  indisputable example. Former Mexican federal deputy attorney general Eduardo Valle Espinosa  put  the  Mexican  system  in  perspective  in  his  resignation statement: "Nobody can outline a political project in which the heads of drug trafficking and their financiers are not included. Because if you do, you  die."  Valle  indicated  that  bribes  make  serving  as  a  Mexican  police chief so lucrative that candidates pay up to $2 million just to get hired. In a strict profit-and-loss accounting, buying a local police office can be a lucrative  investment.  Drug  cartels  are  willing  to  pay  fortunes  to  even low-ranking Mexican officials because the money buys them immunity from prosecution for their crimes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Colombia  is  another  country  where  the  top  rungs  of  government  are dominated by drug lords. The U.S. authorities have recently revoked the U.S. visa of Colombian 285</p>

<p class="calibre1">president  Ernesto  Samper  on  grounds  that  he  knowingly  received political contributions from drug dealers in exchange for favors. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Pot Calls the Kettle Black</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Anyone  who  has  followed  the  reports  in  our  newsletter,  <i class="calibre3">Strategic</i> <i class="calibre3">Investment</i>, during the 1990s will immediately recognize the irony in the Clinton  administration's  posturing  about  Samper.  There  is  credible evidence that U.S. President Bill Clinton has done everything Samper is accused  of  and  worse.  Even  if  you  would  not  take  our  word  for  it, Clinton's  background  is  highlighted  in  gaudy  detail  in  two  well-researched books by authors on opposite sides of the political divide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Roger  Morris,  who  takes  a  generally  left-wing  perspective,  was  a national security official in the Nixon administration, as well as a senior aide to Dean Acheson, President Lyndon Johnson, and Walter Mondale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris has a doctorate from Harvard University. </p>

<p class="calibre1">His book,  <i class="calibre3">Partners in Power</i> details a sordid past for Clinton that makes Samper seem like a Boy Scout. </p>

<p class="calibre1">459</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-461"></a>Morris recounts Clinton's fatherless childhood in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a center of gambling, prostitution, and organized crime to which most of his family had some connection. Clinton's step-uncle, Raymond Clinton, to  whom  Bill  Clinton  referred  as  a  "father  figure,"  was  reputedly  a leading "Godfather" figure in the Dixie mafia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris  alleges  that  Bill  Clinton  became  a  CIA  recruit  and  spent  his student days at Oxford monitoring anti-Vietnam War activists. As Morris sees  things,  Clinton  remained  a  CIA  asset  through  his  period  as governor, facilitating a CIA drug-and gun-running operation centered in Mena,  Arkansas.  Morris  seems  to  indict  the  CIA  as  a  whole  for  drug trafficking, rather than entertaining the possibility that Clinton threw in with a corrupt faction of the agency, which seems more probable to us. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Either  interpretation,  however,  still  suggests  that  the  main  covert intelligence  agency  of  the  U.S.  government  either  directly  or  indirectly participates in organized drug running on a large scale. If the CIA is not an adjunct of organized crime, it is tripping dangerously close to being 50. 21</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">One Chance in 250,000,000</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  Partners  in  Power  contains  details  that  would  interest  any student  of  the  corruption  of  modern  American  politics.  And  by  no means, however, are all of Morris's fingers pointed at Bill Clinton. </p>

<p class="calibre1">His  wife  comes  in  for  some  critical  attention  as  well.  For  example, consider  this  excerpt  from  Morris's  account  of  Hillary  Clinton's miraculous  commodity  trading:  "In  1995  economists  at  Auburn  and North Florida Universities ran a sophisticated computer statistical model of the First Lady's trades for publication in the  <i class="calibre3">Journal of Economics</i> <i class="calibre3">and</i> <i class="calibre3">Statistics</i>, using all the available records as well as market data from the <i class="calibre3">Wall Street</i> <i class="calibre3">Journal</i>.  The  probability  of  Hillary  Rodham's  having  made her  trades  legitimately,  they  calculated,  was  less  than  one  in 250,000,000." 22 Morris musters many incriminating 286</p>

<p class="calibre1">details  about  the  drug-running  and  money-laundering  operation  that prospered in Arkansas under Clinton. </p>

<p class="calibre1">460</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-462"></a>"By  the  sheer  magnitude  of  the  drugs  and  money  its  flights  generated, tiny  Mena,  Arkansas,  became  in  the  1980s  one  of  the  world  centers  of the narcotics trade." 23</p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris  quotes  an  intimate  as  testifying  about  Clinton  that  "He  knew." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Clinton  not  only  knew  of  the  cocaine  smuggling  but  told  state  trooper L..D.  Brown,  a  former  bodyguard  whom  Clinton  helped  to  land  a position with the CIA, that the drug running was not a CIA operation. " </p>

<p class="calibre1">'Oh, no,' Clinton said, 'That's Lasater's deal.' "24 Dan Lasater, convicted cocaine  distributor,  was  one  of  Clinton's  major  financial  supporters,  a man  who  made  millions  from  Arkansas  state  business  and  once reportedly gave $300,000 in cash in a brown paper bag to then Kentucky Governor  John  Y.  Brown.  According  to  Morris,  Lasater  "was  never merely  another  big  donor  to  be  paid  special  deference,  but  an extraordinary  intimate  whom  Clinton  visited  regularly  at  his  brokerage and who came to the mansion whenever he pleased." 25 Morris recounts that Lasater's driver, who frequently brought him to the mansion, was "a convicted  murderer  who  carried  a  gun  and  was  widely  known  to  deal drugs on the side."26 According to Morris's account, the President of the United States appears to have been on warmer terms with a drug dealer than  the  relationship  alleged  between  Colombian  president  Ernesto Samper and the Cali cartel. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Whew!  Bob  says  things  about  Bill  Clinton  that  even  Hillary  wouldn't</i> <i class="calibre3">say" </i> P.J. O'ROURKE</p>

<p class="calibre1">R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr., editor-in-chief of  <i class="calibre3">The American Spectator</i> is not a left liberal like Morris. But his account  <i class="calibre3">Boy Clinton</i> contains many of the same details cited by Morris in painting a portrait of Clinton as a corrupt politician, intimately linked to drug dealing and other crimes. Indeed, the Prologue  to   <i class="calibre3">Boy  Clinton</i>  quotes  L.  D.  Brown,  Clinton's  former bodyguard, making the sensational allegation that Clinton was complicit in  death-squad  activity  designed  to  eliminate  witnesses  who  were knowledgeable about drug dealing at Mena. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Specifically, Brown testifies that he was personally dispatched to Puerto Vallarta,  Mexico,  on  June  18,  1986,  with  a  Belgian-made  F.A.L.  light automatic  rifle.  Traveling  under  the  alias  Michael  Johnson,  Brown  was to have shot and killed Terry Reed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">461</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-463"></a>Reed,  as  you  may  remember,  came  to  public  attention  in  1994  as  the coauthor  of   <i class="calibre3">Compromised:  Clinton,  Bush  and  the  CIA</i>.  The  thesis  of <i class="calibre3">Compromised</i> is that the CIA has "co-opted the presidency," and that its</p>

<p class="calibre1">"black  operations,  like  a  cancer  have  metastasized  the  organs  of government."  More  specifically,  Reed  and  his  coauthor  claim  that  both Clinton  and  Bush  were  deeply  compromised  by  involvement  in  illegal activities in Arkansas, including drug trafficking. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Brown did not kill Reed, as instructed. He and Reed managed to survive to tell at least part of their tales, which makes them luckier than others who were involved with Clinton, then and later. Consider the late Jerry Parks, who provided security for the Clinton-Gore headquarters in 1992</p>

<p class="calibre1">and was shot dead, in a gangland-style assassination, in September 1993. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In another bizarre twist to a twisted tale, London's  <i class="calibre3">Sunday Telegraph</i> 287</p>

<p class="calibre1">has revealed, on the basis of exclusive information provided by Parks's widow,  that  Parks  was  hired  to  spy  on  Bill  Clinton  by  the  late  Vincent Foster. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Why  Foster  wanted  to  compile  a  dossier  of  compromising  information on Clinton is anyone's guess. (He said he was doing it for Hillary.) But in any event it belies the official depiction of Foster as a naive country boy, so shocked by the ruthless ways of Washington that he killed himself in despair. That never-plausible story becomes less plausible with each new revelation.27</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">The Mob's President</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">While the world as a whole draws back from the disturbing conclusion that the President of the United States is tainted by close association with organized crime and criminals, that is what the evidence suggests. Morris quotes a former U.S. Attorney who tracked organized crime figures and their interests. He claims that Clinton's election as governor in 1984 "was the election when the mob really came into Arkansas politics, the dog-track and racetrack boys, the payoff people who saw a good thing.... it went beyond our old Dixie Mafia, which was penny-ante by comparison. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  was  eastern  and  West  Coast  crime  money  that  noticed  the possibilities just like the legitimate corporations did." </p>

<p class="calibre1">462</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-464"></a>28  Apparently,  others  of  like  mind  have  continued  to  notice  the possibilities with Clinton.  <i class="calibre3">New York</i> magazine, following an earlier piece in  <i class="calibre3">Readers' Digest</i>,  reports  that  "the  president's  key  allies  in  the  trade-union movement are also men affiliated with what to all appearances are some  of  the  dirtiest,  most  mobbed-up  unions  in  America."29  Of particular interest is Clinton's close relationship with Arthur Coia. Coia, who is one of Clinton's "prime fund raisers," is president of the Laborers International  Union  of  North  America,  "one  of  the  most  flamboyantly corrupt  unions  in  labor  history."30  Apparently,  the  Justice  Department under  Mr.  Clinton  struck  what  New  York  describes  as  a  "weirdly generous  deal"  with  Coia  "to  keep  his  job  in  the  face  of  compelling charges  from  that  very  same  Justice  Department  that  he  is  a  long-time associate  of  organized-crime  figures."  31  Whether  or  not  Terry  Reed's thesis  is  correct  that  "the  CIA  has  co-opted  the  presidency,"  there  is obviously  a  strong  temptation  for  individuals  within  a  covert organization  authorized  to  undertake  "black  operations"  to  indulge  in Professor Hirshleifer's rational choice of employing "unlawful means of acquiring resources." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Given  thc  technological  change  that  is  reducing  the  decisiveness  of massed  military  power  in  the  world,  one  should  perhaps  expect  to  see increasing  corruption,  if  not  outright  takeover  of  governments  by organized criminal enterprises. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hirshleifer  argues,  and  we  agree,  that  "the  institutions  of  political economy can never be so perfect as to entirely displace ... the underlying realities of natural economy." </p>

<p class="calibre1">32  Power  is  devolving  in  the  "natural  economy."  This  implies  far-reaching shifts in the internal margins of power in society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Political  corruption,  as  Vito  Tanzi  shrewdly  notes,  "represents  a privatization of the state in which its power is not shi fled to the market, as  privatization  normally  implies,  but  to  government  officials  and bureaucrats."33 In effect, this has happened to 288</p>

<p class="calibre1">the  FBI  and  other  police  agencies  under  Clinton.  The  "rule  of  law"  is becoming whatever Clinton and his cronies want it to be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">463</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-465"></a>As  of  now,  there  seems  little  evidence  that  details  of  these  corrupt connections will carry any weight with voters, even if they were taken up and discussed in the mass media. To the contrary. There seems to be little concern about hints that the President of the United States is complicit in drug running, money laundering, and worse. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  brings  to  mind  the  late  Walter  Lippmann's  fear  that  voters  lacked the perception to see through what he called fictitious personalities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He thought that voters "are ill-served by flattery and adulation. And they are betrayed by the servile hypocrisy which tells them that what is true and what is false, what is right and what is wrong, can be determined by their  votes."  Lippmann  perceived  a  "breakdown  in  the  constitutional order" that could be "the cause of the precipitate and catastrophic decline of Western society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We have fallen far in a short span of time. ... What we have seen is not only decay-though much of the old structure is dissolving-but something which  can  be  called  an  historic  catastrophe."  35  The  problem  is  that political  judgments  seem  less  a  response  to  the  real  world  than  to  a pseudoreality  that  the  general  public  has  constructed  about  phenomena beyond  their  direct  knowledge.36  But  it  is  a  mistake  for  you  to  be governed by the limits of what others see. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  if  you  do  not  give  a  twig  whether  Vincent  Foster  was  murdered, and  his  murder  covered  up  by  the  top  police  agencies  and  responsible officials of the U.S. </p>

<p class="calibre1">government,  including  even  the  current  special  prosecutor,  Kenneth Starr, you might want to consider evidence of the broader pattern of ties between organized criminal enterprise and the White House. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the long run, political corruption at the highest levels makes nonsense of  conventional  celebration  of  the  possibilities  of  democracy  for  the deliberate mastery of public problems. In the Information Age it will be much less important that government be large and powerful than that it be  honest.  Most  of  the  services  that  governments  historically  provided are destined to devolve into the private market in the next millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But  it  is  doubtful  on  the  evidence  from  around  the  world  whether  you 464</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-466"></a>can  long  depend  upon  a  corrupted  system  with  corrupt  leaders  for  the security of your family and investments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Morris  says,  "[T]he  Clintons  are  not  merely  symptomatic,  but emblematic  of  the  larger  bipartisan  system  at  its  end-of-century  dead end." Vito Tanzi, in his essay on corruption, shows that "the only way to deter  corruption  is  to  reduce  significantly  the  scale  of  public intervention."  38  The  Information  Revolution  will  significantly  reduce</p>

<p class="calibre1">"the scale of public intervention" and on that basis holds out hope for a rebirth  of  morality  and  honesty.  The  other  obvious  implication  of  the Information  Revolution  for  morality  is  an  increased  vulnerability  that comes  with  the  possibility  of  cybercommerce  and  virtual  corporations communicating with unbreakable encryption. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Internal thieves within an organization, even a virtual organization, will be  more  difficult  to  detect  and  it  will  be  all  but  impossible  to  recover money  that  is  stolen  or  received  covertly  for  selling  trade  secrets, patents, or other valuable economic assets. </p>

<p class="calibre1">289</p>

<p class="calibre1">Crime pays, and many find it attractive to supplement lawful, productive pursuits  with  unlawful,  predatory  ones.  Unlike  the  usual  situation  that prevailed  in  Western  societies  through  most  of  the  past  two  centuries, criminals  are  not  merely  misfits,  without  social  standing.  When  crime pays, you tend to get a better class of criminal because little social odium attaches to crime. The Sicilian Mafia, for example, along with many drug dealers  who  employ  local  labor  at  inflated  rates,  command  respect  and popular support on their home turf. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE MORAL ORDER AND ITS ENEMIES</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">All strong societies have a strong moral basis. Any study of the history of  economic  development  shows  the  close  relationship  between  moral and  economic  factors.  Countries  and  groups  that  achieve  successful development do so partly because they have an ethic that encourages the economic  virtues  of  self-reliance,  hard  work,  family  and  social responsibility,  high  savings,  and  honesty.  This  is  also  true  of  social subgroups. The business success of Jews, particularly of religious Jews, 465</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-467"></a>of the Puritans in New England, of the Quakers in British business in the eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  or  of  the  Mormons  in  modern America, all show the economic benefits that result from cultures with a strong moral framework. </p>

<p class="calibre1">One  can  take  the  Quakers  as  an  example.  The  Quakers  became successful businesswise, and were particularly successful as bankers, for a number of reasons. They set themselves the highest possible standard of  trustworthiness.  They  would  not  swear  oaths,  but  regarded  every business  commitment  as  being  as  binding  as  an  oath.  "My  word  is  my bond" was for them an absolute principle. They believed in a quiet style of living, decent but frugal. As a religious duty, they avoided spending money on the vanities of this world. They avoided quarrels, and thought war was always sinful. They thought that the businessman had a moral obligation  to  give  fair  value,  and  as  merchants  they  developed  a reputation  for  maintaining  high  quality  with  moderate  prices.  "Caveat emptor"-let the buyer beware-was not good enough for them. In an age when  most  merchants  followed  a  high-price,  high-margin  theory  of trade,  the  Quaker  morality  led  them  naturally  to  a  low-margin,  high-turnover policy. As Henry Ford later showed, this can be potentially far more profitable. They followed this business policy because they thought it their duty not to cheat their customer, but it turned out to be the best way to expand their businesses. The Quakers proved good people to do business with, so their customers came back; there were profits on both sides.  As  a  high-saving  community,  which  honored  its  obligations,  the Quakers  had  an  advantage  as  bankers,  and  membership  in  the  Quakers was itself a business asset which inspired confidence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately  such  business  advantages  can  be  eroded  by  the  very success  they  produce.  Countries  go  through  a  cycle,  which  formed  the basis of Adam Ferguson's sociological theory in the eighteenth century, from poverty and hard work, to riches, to luxury, to decadence, and on to decline.  The  ancient  Romans  themselves  looked  back  to  the  virtues  of the  Republican  period,  when  the  Empire  was  being  built,  and  deplored the luxury and laziness that they regarded as the cause of their decline. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This erosion of the 290</p>

<p class="calibre1">industrious  virtues  by  prosperity  can  happen  surprisingly  quickly.  The Germans are still a capable and efficient people, but they are not working 466</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-468"></a>anything like as hard as they did when they were rebuilding their country after the ruin of defeat in 1945. In two generations, they have gone from working long hours, almost with their bare hands, in conditions of acute poverty,  to  working  short  hours  for  the  highest  pay  and  the  most expensive welfare on earth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  October  1995,  the  Petersburg  Declaration  was  signed  by  sixteen German  associations  of  employers.  It  is  a  catalogue  of  well-justified complaints, which reflect the decline in Germany's industrial morale. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Germany's tax burden reached record highs in 1995, particularly due to the  solidarity  surcharge  and  payments  for  nursing  care  insurance.  With total corporate taxation amounting to more than 60 per cent, Germany is far above the comparative international level of 35 to 40 per cent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Public  sector  habits  such  as  regulated  promotions,  jobs  for  life  and higher pension payments have to be replaced by the free market rules of meritocratic promotion and compensation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Due to the fact that Germany has the highest labour costs in the world, wage  policies  have  to  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  unemployment  by alleviating the costs for enterprises...Wage increases should be measured according  to  competitiveness  and  productivity....  The  behavior  of  the unions has to change. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The yearly ritual of campaigns, demands, workers' mobilization, threats, and warning strikes is damaging. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  anxiety  that  the  Germans,  particularly  the  young  and  the  heirs  of prosperity, have lost the habit of work is shared by Chancellor Kohl. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The existing Volkswagen labor contract gives the highest pay for any car workers on earth, to which welfare taxes have to be added, in return for a 28-hour week-four days of seven hours each. Postwar Germany is now a massive exporter of jobs. The British were regarded in the middle of the nineteenth  century  as  the  most  efficient  industrial  nation,  a  reputation they  had  certainly  lost  a  hundred  years  later.  The  cycle  of  prosperity undoubtedly undermines virtues of hard work and modest expectations, which  exist  at  the  early  stages  of  successful  industrial  development. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-469"></a>Nations are not able to retain their early virtues, just as individuals can become greedy and lazy with too easy a success. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Global  investment  undoubtedly  rewards  these  industrious  virtues  and penalizes those who become greedy and lazy, as it should. Indeed, one could say that sound investment has to be based on a moral as well as a purely  financial  assessment.  The  Englishman  in  the  eighteenth  century who  subscribed  to  the  capital  of  a  Quaker  bank  was  likely  to  do  very well.  In  the  nineteenth  century,  the  Quakers  invested  in  chocolate businesses,  since  they  thought  that  cocoa  was  healthier  than  alcohol.  It probably is. Yet an investment in Fry's or Cadbury's was certainly a good investment.  Investors  should  be  concerned  to  avoid  the  periods  of decadence.  Even  if  Germany  retains  a  strong  position  in  the  European market,  and  high  industrial  skills,  high  labor  costs  and  short  working hours have already reduced Germany's future potential. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Social  morality  and  economic  success  are  insolubly  linked.  But  what factors  help  to  maintain,  or  tend  to  undermine,  the  social  morality? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Arnold  Toynbee,  the  great  philosophic  historian  of  the  first  half  of  the twentieth century, formulated the theory of the challenge and response. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Societies are invigorated by challenges, and develop virtue they did not even know they possessed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There has always been a human recognition that hard times may develop, and  normally  do  develop,  healthier  responses  than  those  of  periods  of prosperity.  In  our  individual  lives,  we  all  try  to  make  ourselves comfortable, we hope to live in a house that we enjoy, have a job that we like, have enough money in the bank, and so on. The struggle to achieve these  objectives  is  a  rewarding  one.  We  study  at  school,  we  train ourselves,  we  work  hard  at  our  wage  policies  have  to  contribute  to  the reduction  of  unemployment  by  alleviating  the  costs  for  enterprises.  -  .. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Wage  increases  should  be  measured  according  to  competitiveness  and productivity.  ...  The  behaviour  of  the  unions  has  to  change.  The  yearly ritual  of  campaigns,  demands,  workers'  mobilization,  threats,  and warning strikes is damaging. </p>

<p class="calibre1">468</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-470"></a>In  far  too  many  people  the  achievement  of  these  objectives  creates something  of  a  trap.  The  struggle  is  better  than  the  achievement.  The great Swiss psychologist Carl Jung had an American businessman as his patient early in this century. The businessman had these very ambitions as  a  young  man.  He  had  worked  to  establish  his  own  business,  and  to make  enough  money  to  retire  by  the  age  of  forty.  He  married  a  young and  attractive  woman,  he  bought  a  beautiful  home,  he  had  a  young family, his business was highly successful, and by the age of forty he had indeed been able to sell out and retire, a rich and independent man with nothing apparently to worry about. At first he enjoyed his freedom, was able  to  do  things  he  had  long  promised  himself.  He  took  his  family  to Europe.  They  visited  art  galleries  and  so  on.  Gradually  these  interests, and his sense of freedom itself, began to pale. He started to look back at the  time  when  he  was  not  free,  when  he  was  working  all  hours  at  his business and had all the usual business worries, as the happy period of his life. He fell into a depression, which led his wife to bring him to Jung as  a  patient.  Jung  diagnosed  him,  in  effect,  as  having  no  outlet  for  his creative  energy,  which  had  turned  in  on  him,  and  was  destroying  him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The diagnosis may well have been correct, but it did not lead to a cure. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The businessman never recovered from his nervous breakdown. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  human  beings  it  is  the  struggle  rather  than  the  achievement  that matters; we are made for action, and the achievement can prove to be a great disappointment. The ambition, whatever it may be, sets the struggle in  motion,  but  the  struggle  is  more  enjoyable  than  its  own  result,  even when the objective is fully achieved. And, of course, for most people, the objectives  can  be  achieved  only  partially.  Most  of  us  do  not  have  as much money as we would like, and do not live in our dream house. We have to settle for something less. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This sense that virtue is dynamic, that it consists in the effort rather than the result, developed strongly in the nineteenth century, and in different ways. There is a well-known poem by Arthur Hugh Clough that brought comfort  to  many  people  in  the  life-and-death  struggle  of  the  Second World War. It is worth noting that suicide rates in 292</p>

<p class="calibre1">the warring countries fell in the Second World War; even the struggle of war can be better than the depression of inactivity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This active competition still appeals to the modern sensibility. Indeed, it is  how  many  modern  men  and  women  lead  their  lives,  in  a  continuous struggle  to  seize  the  opportunities  of  a  potentially  hostile  environment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We all live in a competitive world, and most of us do not wish to contract out  of  it.  There  is,  of  course,  the  contemplative  spiritual  temperament, but it is quite rare. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A  similar  nineteenth-century  perception  of  this  dynamic  morality  was developed by William James, the greatest of American philosophers, in an address to the Yale Philosophical Club in 1891:</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  deepest  difference,  practically,  in  the  moral  life  of  man  is  the difference between the easygoing and the strenuous mood. When in the easygoing  mood  the  shrinking  from  present  ill  is  our  ruling consideration.  The  strenuous  mood,  on  the  contrary,  makes  us  quite indifferent  to  present  ill,  if  only  the  greater  ideal  be  attained.  The capacity for the strenuous mood probably lies slumbering in every man but it has more difficulty in some than others in waking up. It needs the wilder passions to arouse it, the big fears, loves and indignation; or else the  deeply  penetrating  appeal  of  some  one  of  the  higher  fidelities,  like 470</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-472"></a>justice, truth, and freedom. Strong relief is a necessity of its vision; and a world where all the mountains are brought down and all the valleys are exalted is no congenial place for its habitation. This is why in a solitary 293</p>

<p class="calibre1">thinker this mood might slumber on forever without waking. His various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the  same  denominational  value:  he  can  play  fast  or  loose  with  them  at will. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximal stimulating power. Life, to be sure, is even in such a world a genuine ethical symphony; but it is played in  the  compass  of  a  couple  of  poor  octaves,  and  the  infinite  scale  of values fails to open up. </p>

<p class="calibre1">William  James  believed  that  the  dynamic  morality,  which  consists  in doing rather than being, in acting rather than refraining from action, can be  extended  into  the  religious  sphere.  There  is  also  a  powerful development of the morality of competition and survival in the work of Adam Smith (1776), moral doctrine of the present world economic order, its central theme needs careful consideration. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  dominant  idea  of  Darwinism  is  that  species  survive  through adaptation to their environment, and that this process of natural selection shapes  the  characteristics  of  the  species.  In  animals  the  process  is  the result of random mutations, which are now known to belong to a genetic process  Darwin  himself  could  only  guess  at.  The  survival  of  human societies depends, however, on cultural choices that are based on human intelligence.  Culture  changes  human  society  as  genes  change  other species. Change can therefore take place much faster in our societies. It does  not  have  to  work  through  many  generations  as  it  does  when  it depends on random genetic mutations. In place of the natural selection in animals,  human  beings  have  developed  cultural  selection,  with  some cultures,  at  some  stage  of  human  history,  developing  new  technologies that  gave  them  a  decisive  advantage  in  wealth  creation  or  mustering power. The cultural edge of new technologies, such as Iron Age man had over Bronze Age man, or electronic man has over mechanical man, are decisive.  Adam  Smith  may  not  have  been  the  first  writer  on  economic 471</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-473"></a>matters to reduce the welfare of nations to the action of individuals, but he put it most succinctly and with the greatest authority: Every  individual  is  continually  exerting  himself  to  find  out  the  most advantageous  employment  for  whatever  capital  he  can  command.  It  is his own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thomas Malthus, the founder of population studies, saw that the Adam Smith  argument  could  be  applied  not  only  to  the  development  of  the economy of nations but also to the survival of human populations. He is well  known  for  his  proposition  that  "Population,  when  unchecked, increases  in  a  geometrical  ratio.  Subsistence  increases  only  in  an arithmetical  ratio.  A  slight  acquaintance  with  numbers  will  show  the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second." </p>

<p class="calibre1">294</p>

<p class="calibre1">Malthus even saw, long before Darwin, that the same principle applied throughout nature:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Through  the  animal  and  vegetable  kingdoms,  nature  has  scattered  the seeds  of  life  abroad  with  the  most  profuse  and  liberal  hand~  She  has been comparatively sparing in the room, and the nourishment necessary to rear them. The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in  the  course  of  a  few  thousand  years.  Necessity,  that  imperious  all-pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  way  the  world  develops,  even  at  this  stage  of  Adam  Smith  and Malthus, had already come to be understood by the end of the eighteenth century  as  dynamic,  which  it  had  always  been  in  fact.  The  human species,  itself  one  among  many,  is  forced  to  compete  by  the  mismatch between  its  unlimited  capacity  for  generation  and  its  limited  ability  to grow  food.  The  survival  of  human  societies,  as  of  animal  species, depends  on  successlul  adaptation  to  the  environment.  A  dynamic morality  is  therefore  concerned  with  overcoming  the  problems  of 472</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-474"></a>adaptation.  This  is  best  achieved  by  individuals  who  adapt  their  own actions  to  the  opportunities  of  the  environment,  and  therefore  employ resources available in the society to the greatest advantage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Malthus  already  saw  that  Adam  Smith's  ideas  had  changed  the  world, and he wrote that his new argument about population was not new: "The principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume and in part by Dr. Adam Smith." He also saw that this constant competition for  survival  was  a  moral,  not  merely  a  practical,  matter.  The  last paragraph of the 1798 "Essay" reads:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Evil exists in the world, not to create despair, but activities. We are not patiently to submit to it, but to exert ourselves to avoid it. It is not only the interest, but the duty of every individual, to use his utmost efforts to remove evil from himself, and from as large a circle as he can influence; and the more he exercises himself in this duty, the more wisely he directs his  efforts,  and  the  more  successful  these  efforts  are;  the  more  he  will probably improve and exalt his own mind, and the more completely does he appear to fulfil the will of his Creator. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  one  can  illustrate  Darwin's  sense  of  the  importance  of  this argument from his summary of the contents of Chapter 3 of his epoch-making book,  <i class="calibre3">On the Origin</i> <i class="calibre3">of Species</i>, first published in 1859. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He  called  this  crucial  chapter  "Struggle  for  Existence."  The  subject readlines  are:  "Bears  on  Natural  Selection-The  term  used  in  a  wide sense-Geometrical  powers  of  increase-Rapid  increase  of  naturalized animals  and  plants-Nature  of  the  checks  to  increase-Competition universal-Effects of climate-Protection from the number of individuals-Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature-Struggle for  life  most  severe  between  individuals  and  varieties  of  the  same species; oflen severe 295</p>

<p class="calibre1">between species of the same genus-The relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations." Since 1776, it has been evident that the best way to optimize the wealth of nations is to allow individuals to optimize  their  own  return  on  capital  in  conditions  of  free  competition. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Since 1798, it has been evident that the relative survival of populations depended  on  societies  having  sufficient  economic  and  political  success 473</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-475"></a>to  be  able  to  feed  themselves,  protect  themselves  from  infectious diseases,  and  protect  their  populations  in  war.  Since  1859,  it  has  been evident  that  the  whole  drama  of  life,  in  the  human,  the  animal,  or  the vegetable  kingdom,  consists  of  a  continuous  struggle  for  survival,  in which those species or cultures that are nearest to each other may be the greatest rivals. This struggle requires a dynamic morality, which actively wards off evil and does not merely respond to it when it happens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These ideas have been so powerful that it has been impossible for anyone to think about the nature of humanity, or the problems of morality, since the time in which they were developed, without responding to them. Karl Marx  believed  in  the  struggle  for  survival  just  as  much  as  Charles Darwin, but he believed it was a war between social classes, themselves formed  by  economic  forces.  Adolf  Hitler  believed  in  the  struggle  for survival,  and  saw  his  own  political  career  almost  exclusively  in  those terms. But he believed that the struggle was one between different races. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Hitler can all be called social Darwinists, in that they saw the struggle for survival, "Mein Kampf" as Hitler called it,  as  the  central  political  issue.  The  Marxists  saw  social  classes  as though they were separate species; the Nazis saw races in the same light. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This,  however,  makes  not  a  dynamic  morality,  such  as  Malthus envisaged, but a dynamic immorality. Both Marxism and Nazism wished to solve the same problem, the problem of the struggle for survival, but by  destroying  competition.  They  invaded  foreign  territories,  they promoted  conflict  between  different  classes  who  competed  for  social power,  or  different  races  who  were  seen  either  as  economic  exploiters (the normal charge made against Jews by anti-Semites) or as a dangerous underclass (the fear held of blacks by their white enemies). </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Second World War was an attempt by Adolf Hitler, which failed, to secure  an  advantage  in  survival  terms  of  the  German  people,  by destroying  potential  competition,  particularly  Slavs  and  Jews.  By  an interesting  paradox,  defeat  in  war  proved  more  advantageous  to Germany than the victory of the Nazis could ever have been. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The alternative to destructive "interference" competition is collaborative competition,  and  collaborative  competition  is  the  central  idea  of  Adam Smith, and also of Malthus and of William James. </p>

<p class="calibre1">474</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-476"></a>The  archetype  of  destructive  competition  is  the  conqueror.  He  destroys his competitors in order to seize their assets, which may include taking over  their  countries  and  may  involve  the  enslavement  of  their  peoples. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The archetype of collaborative competition is the merchant. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It is in the interest of the merchant that the customer should be satisfied with  the  transaction,  because  onlv  a  satisfied  customer  comes  back  for more  trade.  It  is  also  in  the  interest  of  the  merchant  that  the  customer should be prosperous, because a prosperous customer has the money to go  on  buying.  Conquest  implies  the  destruction  of  the  other  party; commerce  implies  the  satisfaction  of  the  other  party.  As  modern technology has 296</p>

<p class="calibre1">made  conquest  an  extraordinarily  dangerous  policy,  commerce  has become the only rational approach to the problems of survival. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  interdependence  is  strengthened  by  another  central  idea  of  Adam Smith~not  new  with  him~which  is  the  specialization  of  function.  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Wealth of Nations</i> starts with a celebrated passage in which Adam Smith observes  that  "the  greatest  improvement  in  the  productive  powers  of labour,  and  the  greater  part  of  the  skill,  dexterity  and  judgement  with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour." He points out that "the important business of making  a  pin  is,  in  this  manner,  divided  into  about  eighteen  distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands."  The  more  complete  the  specialization  of  function,  the  more efficient the manufacture is likely to be, but obviously such an economy is  highly  interdependent.  If  it  is  to  be  successful,  it  has  to  be collaborative. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A successful social morality must therefore have certain characteristics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It must be strong-a weak morality will be vulnerable and ineffective. It must  contribute  to  the  struggle  for  survival,  but  in  ways  that  are collaborative  rather  than  murderous.  Hitler  had  a  strong  morality  of survival, but its destructive quality nearly destroyed his own society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  must  be  dynamic,  to  match  the  dynamic  changes  of  modern technology, and indeed of all modern social systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">475</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-477"></a>It  must  be  economically  efficient.  The  mixture  of  egalitarian  and authoritarian ideas in the Leninist system simply did not work. Yet these are  not  all  the  characteristics  that  such  a  social  morality  might  be expected  to  possess.  It  has  a  broader  purpose  of  making  the  society  a good one to live in, and of binding people together. Also, moralities have to  adapt  and  survive;  a  brittle  morality  may  be  acceptable  in  our generation only to be rejected in the next. A traditional social morality may be too inflexible to adapt to successive changes in social structure. </p>

<p class="calibre1">On  the  other  hand  a  purely  relativist  system  is  not  a  morality  at  all;  it gives no clear signals on how to behave. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  can  first  of  all  put  all  social  morality  inside  a  context.  A  strong community, even a virtual community, depends upon the morality being widely accepted. The most successtul periods in the history of societies tend to be those in which the collective morality is fully shared. Such a morality  not  only  performs  specific  functions  such  as  reducing  crime, and helping to support family and social structures, but gives citizens a sense of purpose and direction. Such a consensus on morality historically seems  to  depend  on  there  being  a  dominant  religion,  whether  that  is  a state  religion  of  the  early  survival  for  a  dispersed  people;  the  Islamic religion with its social rules; the Catholicism of the Middle Ages; or the Protestantism  of  early  New  England.  The  three  ideas  of  a  people,  a morality,  and  a  religion  depend  upon  one  another,  and  each  tends  to reinforce the others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  such  a  moral  society,  the  individual  citizen  is  able  to  work  toward personal objectives inside a framework of social support. Admittedly the moral laws may be somewhat arbitrary, or at least may appear arbitrary to outsiders. The Orthodox Jew loses the freedom to eat pork or shellfish, or to work on the Sabbath. The loyal Catholic may lose the freedom to use artificial contraceptives, let alone to have an abortion. The Moslem may lose the freedom to drink alcohol. The pious Confucian may have the inconveniently long period of mourning for his reverend father-even Confucius himself 297</p>

<p class="calibre1">warned that mourning rituals could be exaggerated. Yet the adherent to each  of  these  systems  of  belief  regards  these  observations  as  a  small price to pay for a shared and coherent sense of world order, in which the individual has a settled place. An Orthodox Jew could well argue that the 476</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-478"></a>observance of the Sabbath is a small price to pay for the benefits of the Law or the strength of the Jewish family. A shared morality in a tolerant society was the ideal of John Locke and of early philosophers of liberty. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They did not at all believe that a society, of any kind, can be maintained without rules, but they thought that the rules ought to be subject to the best  of  reason,  and  that  people  should  be  coerced  to  accept  only  the essential rules. They did recognize that coercion was inevitable in social morality, particularly in the protection of life or of property, because they considered  that  no  society  can  survive  if  there  is  no  security.  They applied  an  almost  absolute  tolerance  to  variations  in  personal  choices that  did  not  affect  the  welfare  of  others.  The  Confucian,  mourning  his father  for  forty  days,  could  live  next  door  to  the  Jew,  honoring  the Sabbath,  without  either  disturbing  the  other,  or  wanting  to  coerce  him into following his own religious practices. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From this combined doctrine of social morality in essential matters and tolerance in personal decisions, one actually gets a core moral standard that has to be imposed on all citizens and a voluntary ethic that citizens accept  as  individuals  or  as  members  of  subgroups  in  society.  When  a Benedictine  monk  takes  vows  of  poverty,  chastity,  and  obedience,  he does  so  as  a  member  of  such  a  subgroup.  He  does  not  call  on  all Catholics, let alone on all his fellow citizens, to take the same vows, or to observe the same rules. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He  will  be  obedient  to  the  orders  of  his  abbot,  but  he  does  not  expect anyone outside his abbey to pay any attention to them. The adherence to these optional parts of social morality does not need to be universal, but the core morality does have to be shared, and people who will not accept the core morality damage society as well as themselves. In the extreme example, a society overrun with robbers who do not hesitate to murder, as large parts of Europe were afler the fall of the Roman Empire, offers nobody  a  satisfactory  life,  not  even  the  robbers  themselves;  they  are always particularly threatened by other murderers. This is equally true of some inner-city areas of the United States today. Anarchy is not the ideal society,  because  without  the  enforcement  of  law  there  is  no  human security. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When one looks at the forces that are hostile to the morality of society, one needs to consider this core morality, which is broadly similar in most 477</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-479"></a>modern  religious  belief  systems.  Two,  at  least,  of  the  Ten Commandments  of  the  Old  Testament,  for  Christians,  or  the  Torah,  for Jews, can be regarded as universal for anything one could recognize as a religion: "Thou shalt not kill" and "Thou shalt not steal." One can even go beyond that. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Almost  all  serious  agnostics  would  regard  both  murder  and  theft  -  the ultimate threat to life and the ultimate threat to property - as forbidden, and would accept that society has the right to punish people who kill or rob.  They  might  disagree  about  the  appropriate  punishment  for  a particular crime, but not about the right of society to punish as such. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The original phrase of John Locke has it precisely. Everyone has a right to "life, liberty and estate." In 1776 Thomas Jefferson added another of John Locke's phrases, "the pursuit of happiness." That makes a very fine phrase,  and  a  very  fine  aspiration,  but  "life,  liberty  and  estate"  is  more down to earth than "life, liberty, and the pursuit of 298</p>

<p class="calibre1">happiness." Society depends absolutely on the right to life and the right to property. In practice history shows that these rights can be protected only  when  there  is  liberty.  If  the  state  is  all-powerful,  then  the  state becomes  the  great  enemy  of  life,  as  in  wars  of  aggression,  and  of individual property, by taking an inordinate share of the national wealth for its own often undesirable and always wasteful purposes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  core  morality  is,  however,  under  attack  in  the  most  advanced nations,  partly  by  the  very  forces  of  modernity  that  give  these  nations their  technical  edge.  The  United  States  is  the  world's  leading technological  power.  Many  people,  including  most  Americans,  would have  regarded  the  United  States  as  a  moral  example  to  the  rest  of  the world  at  any  time  up  to  the  early  1960s.  Now  that  view  is  seldom expressed, even by Americans who are proud of their country. One could not  listen,  as  the  world  did,  to  the  O.J.  Simpson  trial  and  regard  the United States as the simple virtuous Republic it began by being. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  one  looks  back  at  the  labels  of  the  old  America,  they  reflected  the needs of a frontier society, which colored the attitudes of its citizens even in the big cities. Frontiers are democratic places. </p>

<p class="calibre1">478</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-480"></a>People  feel  themselves  to  be  equal,  and  the  early  Americans  threw  off the class hierarchies of Europe. Even indentured laborers, sent over from England as prisoners, established themselves as independent tradesmen, farmers,  or  free  laborers  once  their  indenture  period  was  over.  Wages were higher than in Europe, and the cost of essentials was low, though imported  manufactures  were  expensive.  On  the  frontier  itself  people depended very much on one another, but the living, if hard, was a good one by European standards. Immigrants might start as low wage earners in the slums of Boston and New York, but they usually escaped from the slums quite soon, and generation after generation found prosperity. After the  Civil  War,  the  blacks  saw  themselves  as  though  they  were  another immigrant group, and many of them shared these American values and objectives. From these the black middle class developed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This aspiration, strengthened by the actual experience of the frontier, and by  the  influence  of  the  churches,  both  Protestant  and  Catholic,  framed the patriotism of Americans. They believed that they lived in God's own country,  a  notion  uniquely  guided  by  democratic  ideals  and  Christian faith,  the  first  and  most  successful  of  the  world's  democracies.  The picture is familiar enough; it is personified in the image we all, or almost all, have of Abraham Lincoln, though one can still find some Americans in the South who see Lincoln as the man who unleashed the horrors of the first modern war to prevent free states from leaving a Union they no longer trusted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the image of Lincoln, craggy, simple, honest, and eloquent, 15 still the supreme American image, and it is essentially a moral one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  Americans  still  feel  the  vivid  original  contrast  between  the democratic  energy  of  the  new  country  and  the  tired  hierarchies  of Europe. This ideal of an essentially dynamic meritocracy is hard for the foreigner to recognize in present-day Los Angeles, New York, Houston, or Washington, even though its traces, and something more than traces, can still be found in the great suburban belts or in the rural areas. The American  Puritan  ethic,  with  all  its  historic  importance,  survives  best north  of  the  snowline,  but  the  entrepreneurial  dynamism  is  more widespread. </p>

<p class="calibre1">299</p>

<p class="calibre1">479</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-481"></a>Americans would point to the decay of the big cities, which have become breeding  grounds  for  crime,  especially  the  narco-business,  as  the  worst symptom  of  the  decline  of  a  communal  sense  of  morality.  Most Americans also recognize that there is a clash of several different moral cultures, all competing in their claims and their authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  'politically  correct"  culture  rejects  many,  but  not  all,  of  the  moral principles that upheld the old culture. It aggressively emphasizes the role and  the  rights  of  groups  who  are  seen  as  having  been  historically exploited  by  a  dominant  white  male  culture,  and  rejects  that  culture, despite its being the founding culture of the United States. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  dominant  male  culture  of  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century centered on the survival of the nuclear family. This historically gave the husband-father  at  least  a  nominal  dominance  in  the  home,  though  in practice the home was often run by the wife-mother with the often meek acceptance of the nominal master. It gave the male boss a real dominance in  the  workplace,  a  dominance  that  the  feminist  movement  has  so  far challenged  but  not  reversed.  The  interest  of  the  family,  and  historic Christian teaching, outlawed abortion. The old morality thought abortion was  unlawful  killing,  was  never  allowable,  and  the  adherents  of  the traditional morality still think that. Adherents of the new morality think the opposite. In Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court based the constitutional right to abortion, which had hitherto been regarded as a question for the individual states, on the doctrine of a right to privacy, itself remote from any language actually to be found in the Constitution or its amendments. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A woman's privacy was held to include the right to have or not to have children,  whatever  the  consequences  to  the  embryo  might  be.  The Supreme Court did not regard the embryo as enjoying any constitutional rights-embryos  being  the  same  extraconstitutional  entities  in  the  late twentieth century that slaves had been in the first half of the nineteenth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" did not apply to slaves, and the  language  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence  was  not  applied  to embryos by the justices in Roe v. Wade. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The abortion debate is the extreme example of the conflict between the old  and  new  morality,  though  there  are  equally  remarkable  conflicts  in other areas where the old social organization with its morality has been 480</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-482"></a>challenged by the new. Traditional Christian morality, in Protestant and Catholic  churches  alike,  laid  great  emphasis  on  sexual  roles:  No heterosexual  intercourse  outside  or  before  marriage.  No  genital homosexual  relationships.  Lesbianism  was  less  emphasized,  because society  hardly  recognized  its  existence.  When  Queen  Victoria  was  first told  of  it,  she  stoutly  refused  to  believe  that  such  things  happened between  women.  Political  correctness  is  the  morality  of  supposedly oppressed  groups.  The  homosexuals  claimed  an  equal  validity  for  their lifestyle,  and  challenged  the  traditional  opposition  to  their  sexual conduct. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Homophobia"  was  regarded  as  being  itself  an  outrageous  form  of prejudice, like racial discrimination. To be critical of gays is regarded by the  new  morality  as  being  as  unacceptable  as  being  critical  of  blacks, Jews, or women. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At the same time other sexual taboos were being eroded or abolished. In the  1960s  there  was  a  new  wave  of  free  love,  partly  based  on  the apparent security of the female contraceptive pill, but also promoted by mood-changing drugs and pop music. It led to an increasing amount of nonmarital cohabitation. By the 1990s it was thought 300</p>

<p class="calibre1">absolutely  normal  in  Bntain,  a  rather  more  old-fashioned  society  than most of the United States, for Prince Edward to sleep with his girlfriend at  Buckingham  Palace,  in  the  same  stable  but  unmarried  intimacy  that students  were  sleeping  with  each  other  in  their  1960s  lodgings.  Few people thought it odd that Queen Elizabeth II, the head of the Church of England, condoned her youngest son's conduct, her three elder children's marriages having already broken down. Those few who complained were regarded as hopelessly out of date and priggish. Yet there were still many people who regarded the old morality as preferable, even if they did not practice it themselves, or seriously expect their children to do so, beyond a fairly early age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  politically  correct  movement  has  had  its  own  puritanical  side. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  it  sprang  from  the  perceived  interests  of  women,  seen  as  the largest  of  the  oppressed  groups,  it  had  a  certain  hostility  to  male sexuality,  both  in  aggressive  and  in  what  would  previously  have  been regarded  as  harmless  forms.  Some  women  took  the  view  that  all  men 481</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-483"></a>were  by  nature  rapists,  and  the  natural  horror  at  rape  was  exaggerated into a general denunciation of the male gender. Others concentrated on sexual  harassment,  a  real  grievance-many  men  have  very  crude  sexual manners-which  became  ludicrous  in  some  trivial  cases.  Sexual harassment  was  even  alleged  in  mere  looks,  without  any  word  being uttered, let alone physical contact. As a result the new morality could be very censorious. </p>

<p class="calibre1">White  people  could  be  accused  of  racial  prejudices,  not  because  they were prejudiced but because they were white. Men could be accused of sexual  harassment  because  their  expressions  showed  that  they  found  a woman  attractive,  something  that  in  an  earlier  generation  had  been regarded as a compliment rather than an insult. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  politically  correct  and  the  fundamentalist  Christian  groups  are bitterly  critical  of  each  other,  yet  in  the  modern  world  they  look  rather alike.  They  both  assume  the  authority  of  a  particular  moral  doctrine  as though it were universal, even though their moral doctrines are different. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Both indeed can be criticized for the same defect, for an exaggerated and overconfident  moralism,  lacking  in  depth,  in  historic  sense,  or  in tolerance.  Both  are  attacked  for  their  supposed  resemblance  to seventeenth~century  Puritanism,  to  the  self-confident  moralists  like Oliver Cromwell in England-he nearly emigrated to New England-or the Salem  witch  hunters.  Neither  the  women’s  movement,  in  its  more dogmatic form, nor the conservative preachers of the Bible belt can be accused of any lack of morality, but of its overdevelopment and rigidity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The heart of these moralities sometimes seems to have turned to stone. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  sort  of  hardening  of  the  moral  arteries  is  as  damaging  to  the consensual morality of society as the "anything goes" </p>

<p class="calibre1">anarchy against which it protests. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  distortion  of  moral  forces,  a  coarsening  into  self-righteousness. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pharisaism,  the  conviction  that  one  is  uniquely  virtuous,  is  as  old  as humankind, and was particularly offensive to Jesus Christ. The erosion of morality, the belief that ethical choices are purely a matter of private preference, as much a matter for the individual as the choice of clothes, is  a  more  recent  phenomenon.  This  belief  reflects  the  absence  of  any shared morality at all. It takes to a quite new stage the classical doctrine 482</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-484"></a>of  liberty,  and  turns  "the  pursuit  of  happiness"  from  what  John  Locke originally meant by the phrase, and Jefferson understood by it in 1776, into a hedonism that is reckless of consequences. </p>

<p class="calibre1">301</p>

<p class="calibre1">The phrase "the pursuit of happiness" is taken from John Locke's Essay on Human Understanding (1691). "the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful pursuit of true and solid happiness, so the care of ourselves  that  we  mistake  not  imaginary  for  real  happiness,  is  the necessary foundation of our liberty." He does go on to say that "everyone does not place his happiness in the same thing.... the mind has a different relish  as  well  as  the  palate....  Men  may  choose  different  things,  yet  all choose  right,  supposing  them  only  like  a  company  of  poor  insects, whereof  some  are  bees,  delighted  with  flowers  and  their  sweetness, others  beetles  delighted  with  other  kinds  of  viands."  Yet  he  goes  on  to argue that to prefer vice to virtue is "manifestly a wrong judgement." He puts particular weight on the religious argument, but considers also that</p>

<p class="calibre1">"wicked  men  have  the  worse  part  here."  He  believes  that  "morality, established upon its true foundations, cannot but determine the choice in anyone who will consider." The Lockean doctrine of liberty undoubtedly gives a wider range to human preferences than more authoritarian moral systems  that  seek  to  treat  all  people  alike,  and  impose  uniformity  of conduct. Yet soon the classic doctrine of liberty recognizes the need for collective  moral  imperatives,  including  respect  for  other  people  in society,  particularly  their  lives  and  the  peaceful  ownership  of  their possessions  under  the  law.  A  general  erosion  of  the  collective  morality threatens  liberty,  both  directly,  in  that  it  introduces  an  element  of anarchy, and indirectly, by encouraging the most authoritarian forces of society.  We  can  see  the  history  of  public  morality  as  a  cycle  between disorder and authoritarianism; the modern authoritarian moralities, both feminism  and  fundamentalism,  have  emerged  as  a  cyclical  response  to the hedonism of the 1960s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We have already described some of the attributes of the new world of the next  century.  It  will  be  shaped  by  two  main  forces,  the  shift  of technology that is opening up the economies of Asia and the new global electronic communications that are making the citizen progressively less dependent  on  his  or  her  local  government.  The  new  technology  will 483</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-485"></a>replace,  or  has  already  replaced,  many  of  the  middle  human  skills-the production  line  worker,  the  office  clerk,  now  increasingly  the  middle manager.  But  it  has  rewarded  the  rarer  skills,  creating  an  international cognitive  elite  of  highly  skilled  people  for  whom  the  new communications open up the widest possible market for their skills. Like most  elites,  the  cognitive  elite  tend  to  be  a  bit  above  themselves,  are rather  arrogant,  and  think  they  can  set  their  own  standards.  They  are alienated from society as a result. </p>

<p class="calibre1">During the first half of the next century there will be a massive transfer of  wealth  from  the  Old  West  to  the  New  East.  Political  failures-and China  is  still  a  politically  backward  country-may  delay  this  transfer  of wealth  and  strategic  power,  but  are  most  unlikely  to  prevent  it.  They cannot reverse it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  process  of  the  shifi  in  wealth  would  in  any  case  put  the  greatest possible  pressure  on  the  white-dominated  countries  of  the  Northern Hemisphere,  on  Europe  and  North  America.  At  present  about  750</p>

<p class="calibre1">million people belong to the advanced countries of this area; until very recently Japan was the only Asian, nonwhite country to have reached the Euro-American  standard  of  living,  though  there  were  ethnically European  populations  in  New  Zealand,  in  Australia,  and  in  the  white population of southern Africa. Even in 1990, the total population of the advanced  industrial  countries  was  only  about  15  percent  of  the  world population  of  5  billion.  The  shape  of  the  distribution  of  the  world's wealth 302</p>

<p class="calibre1">was 15 percent rich, 85 percent poor, very like the income distribution in advanced  industrial  societies  a  hundred  years  ago.  By  2050,  in  an accelerating process, the expectation is that the advanced economies will include about 3 billion people out of a world population that may have risen to 7 billion, or a wealth distribution of 40 percent rich, 60 percent poor. By the end of the century these figures could well be reversed, and the  distribution  could  be  60  percent  rich  and  40  percent  poor,  with poverty  particularly  concentrated  in  Africa.  The  shifi  between  nations will  be  toward  a  greater  equality  of  wealth,  but  inside  nations  it  will probably  be  toward  greater  inequality.  The  efficient  users  of  talent  and capital will have a decisive advantage over those with moderate skills or little  capital.  This  wealth  will  be  highly  mobile.  The  poor  in  the 484</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-486"></a>advanced world will not be able to tax the rich on the twentiethcentury scale;  those  countries  that  try  to  do  so  will  fall  back  in  an  intensely competitive race. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, the total productivity of the world economy will continue to rise, perhaps by an average of 3 percent over the whole world, if there are  no  world  wars.  If  that  proves  correct,  the  total  world  product  will double every twenty-five years, making it more than four times as large as it is now by 2050, and sixteen to twenty times as large by 2100. Even if the world population has increased to 8 billion by 2100, that will give the world GDP per head by the end of the century ten times its present level.  Such  an  increase  in  wealth  can  take  care  of  the  rise  in  the  new industrial societies, and the multimillion-dollar incomes of the cognitive elite, and still provides a decent and rising standard of living for the rest of  the  advanced  workforce.  But  the  differentials  will  be  very  different from those of the twentieth century. In world terms the poor nations will see  their  incomes  grow  much  faster  than  those  of  the  rich  nations;  in national terms, the incomes of the rich, as in the America of the 1990s, will grow much faster than middle or low incomes. In the next century we  shall  witness  the  creation  of  a  world  superclass,  perhaps  of  500</p>

<p class="calibre1">million very rich people, with 100 million being rich enough to emerge as Sovereign Individuals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This process will have an inevitable consequence. Societies will become much less homogeneous; the nationstate will become weaker, or crumble altogether;  the  cognitive  elite  will  see  itself  as  cosmopolitan.  Already people who work in the same global functions are developing a culture that is much closer to that of their fellow workers in other parts of the world  than  to  their  fellow  citizens  in  the  old  nationstates.  A  London investment banker will probably feel more at home in Seoul than he will in Glasgow; a Washington civil servant may feel more at home in Bonn than  in  black  areas  of  Washington  itself.  We  can  already  see  the splintering effect that this process has on moral values. The morality of the individual is partly framed by education, by what the individual has been taught as a child; it is also partly framed by experience of life. Both the  education  and  the  experiences  of  the  cognitive  elite  will  be cosmopolitan,  and  will  tend  to  divorce  people  from  their  local communities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">485</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-487"></a>As we move toward the next century, a high proportion of people in the growing  cognitive  elite  have  been  given  little  religious  or  moral education  in  the  family.  The  commonest  religion  of  the  elite  is  an agnostic humanism. Many such families are themselves split by divorce, remarriage,  and  subsequent  third  marriages.  The  marriage  pattern  in Hollywood is not universal in the United States, but the cognitive elite in Euro-303</p>

<p class="calibre1">America has a high divorce rate, probably averaging a third or more. The children  of  these  divorced  parents  seldom  have  a  basic  religious education,  and  are  aware  of  the  variations  of  moral  attitude  between parents, stepparents, and step-siblings. If one compares the initial moral education of this group with that of an Irish or Polish village, the peasant education obviously provides much the stronger religious training of the two. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A godless, rootless, and rich elite is unlikely to be happy, or to be loved. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This  inadequacy  in  the  initial  moral  education  of  what  will  be  the dominant economic group of the next century is likely to be reinforced by their life experience. </p>

<p class="calibre1">These  people  will  have  the  discipline  of  an  advanced  technical education, of one sort or another, to fit themselves for their new role as the leaders of the new electronic universe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But they will learn from that only some of the moral lessons that have historically  been  the  framework  for  human  social  conduct.  By  the standards of Confucius, Buddha, or Plato (500 B.C.), St. Paul (A.D. 50), or  Mahomet  (A.D.  600),  they  may  be  moral  illiterates.  They  will  have been taught the lessons of economic efficiency, the use of resources, the pursuit  of  money,  but  not  the  virtues  of  humility  or  self-sacrifice,  let alone  chastity.  Essentially  most  of  them  will  have  been  brought  up  as pagans with a set of values closer to those of the late Roman Republic than  to  Christianity.  Even  these  values  will  be  highly  individualistic, rather  than  shared.  Societies,  as  we  have  argued,  can  only  be  strong  if real  moral  values  are  widely  shared.  The  advanced  nations  are  already moving into the situation where many people will hold weak or limited moral values, others will compensate with fierce adherence to irrational 486</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-488"></a>values,  and  few  values  will  be  held  in  common  across  the  whole  of society.  No  doubt,  some  of  the  "competitive  territorial  clubs"  that  we described earlier will impose exacting moral standards for residence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Differences  in  wealth  have  not  in  themselves  historically  produced fundamental differences in religious values. In dense and stable societies with strong traditions, a steep hierarchical structure, "the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate," may conceal values that run through the hierarchy, but this depends upon the strength of the communal feeling of the rich and the poor, and the strength of the social traditions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Neither ofthese conditions exists now, and both community feeling and tradition  are  being  weakened  by  the  economic  and  technological revolution  that  is  taking  place.  The  lives  of  the  many  and  the  few  are becoming  more  and  more  distant  from  each  other.  The  technological revolution  has  been  achieved  by  breaking  away  from  the  old  ways  of doing things. In every field it has been the radical who has won, and the conventional thinker who has fallen behind, who has literally fallen out of  the  race.  Our  politics  may  be  led  by  conventional  thinkers-Bill Clinton,  Helmut  Kohl,  John  Major-but  our  most  successful  businesses are led by radicals with a keen understanding of the new technological world;  the  archetype  is  Bill  Gates.  Conventional  thinking  has  been discredited by its inability to deal with the rapidity and the sheer force of change. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet  morality  is  not  like  that.  If  we  take  the  science  of  Moses,  formed about 1000</p>

<p class="calibre1">B.C., it has very little to tell us. The account of the creation in the Book of Genesis may well contain a theological truth-God made the universe and  humankind  but  it  does  not  give  a  scientific  account  of  the  actual development of physical structures. </p>

<p class="calibre1">304</p>

<p class="calibre1">Yet if we take the morality of Moses-the Ten Commandments-that has a great deal to tell us. </p>

<p class="calibre1">487</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-489"></a>Respect  for  parents  and  faithfulness  in  marriage  are  the  best  ways  to preserve  family  life;  family  life  is  the  best  way  to  bring  up  morally healthy children. Stealing damages the thief and the people from whom things are stolen, and is a disincentive to work and saving. Social order depends on the truth of witnesses. It is wrong to murder, and so on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  science,  three  thousand  years  completely  changed  what  human knowledge  is;  in  morality,  we  may  actually  have  fallen  back.  The average  psychotherapist  probably  gives  the  patient  less  good  moral advice on how to lead his life than the average Jew would have received from his teacher in the period of Moses. Of course, Christianity itself is still available, but it is for most of the world a pale ghost of its former self.  Few  people  have  the  faith  of  the  earlier  ages,  or  even  of  the  less sophisticated communities; one does not look for saints on Park Avenue. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The destruction of tradition has been a necessary condition of scientific progress. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  we  all  still  believed  that  the  sun  revolved  around  the  earth,  then  we could  not  have  developed  satellite  communications.  Indeed  what  we believe  to  be  science  itself  is  only  a  series  of  hypotheses,  imperfect explanations due to be replaced by other explanations, stronger but still imperfect. Yet the destruction of tradition has been a disaster to the moral order of the world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Confucius  taught  that  we  should  always  behave  with  moderation  (he called  the  Golden  Mean  chum  yum,  at  least  as  it  was  translated  by seventeenthcentury scholars). </p>

<p class="calibre1">He  also  taught  that  we  should  respect  authority  and  treat  others  as  we would wish to be treated ourselves. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That  teaching  is  twenty-five  hundred  years  old.  As  a  tradition  it influenced  China  for  all  recorded  history,  but  Confucianism  seems  an outmoded  tradition  to  many  modern  Chinese,  who  do  not  value moderation, who respect force rather than authority, and certainly do not treat others as they would wish to be treated themselves. With the loss of tradition,  societies  can  lose  the  whole  vocabulary  of  their  moral consensus.  China,  with  all  its  advancing  power,  is  now  a  morally 488</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-490"></a>backward country compared to Tibet, impoverished and oppressed as the Tibetans are. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A good social morality has certain characteristics. It should contribute to the survival of society and of individuals, in a dynamic rather than static way. It should include tolerance and avoid self-righteousness. It should be religious, rather than merely agnostic. It should not pretend to decide questions  of  scientific  fact.  It  should  be  neither  anarchic  nor authoritarian. It should be widely shared and deeply held. Such a social morality  is  particularly  important  to  the  family  and  to  the  raising  of children as independent and responsible adults. It provides the focus of a good society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">We  find  that  any  such  morality  is  supported  by  the  logic  of interdependence  that  comes  from  commerce  and  fellow-feeling,  but  is threatened  by  the  attacks  of  a  facile  scientism,  by  the  alienation  of  a superclass  and  a  subclass,  by  the  loss  of  the  rootedness  of  the  old geographical  economies.  Perhaps  there  will  be  a  reaction  against  these trends. </p>

<p class="calibre1">They must be recognized as extremely dangerous to the societies of the next century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">305</p>

<p class="calibre1">As  what  Isaiah  Berlin  called  "the  most  terrible  century  in  Western history" winds down, the age of giantism in social structure also draws to a close. The final days of the twentieth century are destined to be a time of downsizing, devolution, and reorganization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  will  be  the  time  of  the  social  dinosaurs  trapped  in  the  tar  pit.  And  a time of scavengers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Birds will pick the bones of dinosaurs. Governments, corporations, and unions  will  be  obliged  to  adjust  against  their  inclinations  to  new metaconstitutional  conditions  established  by  the  penetration  of microtechnology. It has profoundly shifted the boundaries within which violence is exercised. Today's world has already changed more than we commonly understand, more than CNN and the newspapers tell us. And 489</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-491"></a>it  has  changed  in  precisely  the  directions  indicated  by  a  study  of megapolitical conditions. As we argued first in  <i class="calibre3">Blood in the Streets</i> and then in  <i class="calibre3">The Great Reckoning</i>, when change occurs in technology or the other  factors  that  set  the  boundaries  where  violence  is  exercised,  the character  of  society  inevitably  changes  with  them.  Everything  that  is attached to the way humans interact, including morality and the common sense of the way we see the world, will change as well. After a period of slack morality, which is indicative of the end of an era, we will see the awakening of a sterner morality, with more exacting demands to meet the more exacting requirements of a world of competitive sovereignty. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Several  features  of  the  new  morality  can  be  foreseen.  For  one  thing,  it will  emphasize  the  importance  of  productivity  and  the  correctness  of earnings being retained by those who generate them. Another corollary point will be the importance of efficiency in investment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The morality of the Information Age applauds efficiency, and recognizes the advantage of resources being dedicated to their highest-value uses. In other words, the morality of the Information Age will be the morality of the  market.  As  James  Bennett  has  argued,  the  morality  of  the Information Age will also be a morality of trust. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  cybereconomy  will  be  a  high-trust  community.  In  a  setting  where unbreakable encryption will allow an embezzler or thief to securely place the proceeds of his crimes outside the range of recovery, there will be a very strong incentive to avoid losses by not doing business with thieves and embezzlers in the first place. Just as in the example of the Quakers cited  earlier,  a  reputation  for  honesty  will  be  an  important  asset  in  the cybereconomy. In the anonymity of cyberspace, this reputation may not always apply to a known person, but it will be reliably verifiable through identification  of  cryptographic  keys.  The  possibility  for  radiating difficulties if encryption or certification of encrypted identities becomes corrupted  by  gangsters  or  others  is  daunting  enough  that  it  should strongly militate against the hiring of any person whose behavior could be  indicative  of  a  lack  of  trustworthiness.  Bennett  envisions  "A Gentleman's  Club  of  Cyberspace,"  protected  areas  that  would  require heightened security measures for participation, "possibly using biometric validation  such  as  voice-print  identification.  The  proprietors  would assume the responsibility of vouching for the identity of the participants 490</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-492"></a>and to some extent their trustworthiness, achieving a 'gentleman's club in cyberspace'  (although  ladies  would  be  welcome  these  days).  In  these areas,  people  could  carry  on  transactions  with  greater  security  and confidence than in the general realm of cyberspace. Thus the twenty-first century may see a return to a Victorian-like emphasis 306</p>

<p class="calibre1">on  trustworthiness  and  character  in  an  environment  no  Victorian  could have envisioned." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  protected  areas  of  cyberspace  may  also  offer  guarantees  to  reduce risk similar to the extraterritorial guarantees of protection offered by the Counts  of  Champagne  to  protect  merchants  traveling  to  and  from Champagne  fairs.  Other  jurisdictions  actually  "indemnified  traveling merchants against any losses they might incur while passing through the territory under the jurisdiction of the given noble." "Guards of the Fair," </p>

<p class="calibre1">officials  originally  appointed  by  the  counts,  provided  security  and  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">"tribunal ofjustice" </p>

<p class="calibre1">for merchants at the fair. They ultimately evolved into more independent entities,  with  a  separate  seal,  notarizing  contracts  and  enforcing performance, with the power to "bar from future fairs any trader found guilty of not paying his debts or fulfilling his contracted promises. This was evidently so severe a penalty that few willingly risked this denial of opportunities for future profit. Short of that, however, the guards could seize the goods of a defaulting debtor and sell them for the benefit of his creditors." 39</p>

<p class="calibre1">Ostracism as means of enforcement of contracts declined in importance when the number of alternative markets rose. With the new information technology  now  available,  however,  ostracism  of  cheats  and  those defaulting on contracts could again be a potent enforcement mechanism with the fragmented sovereignties of the next stage of society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Computer linkages can police cyberspace with unforgeable information about credit and fraud. As the world will be in this sense particularly a small community, cheats and frauds will be discouraged. </p>

<p class="calibre1">491</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-493"></a>In  addition  to  emphasizing  the  morality  of  earnings  and  efficiency  and placing  a  renewed  stress  on  character  and  trustworthiness,  the  new morality  is  also~likely  to  stress  the  evil  of  violence,  particularly kidnapping  and  extortion,  which  will  grow  in  importance  as  means  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">"shaking down" individuals whose resources will not otherwise be easy prey to crime. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Still  another  likely  spur  to  sterner  morality  will  be  the  end  of entitlements and income redistribution. When the hope of aid for those falling behind is based primarily upon appeals to private individuals and charitable  bodies,  it  will  be  more  important  than  it  has  been  in  the twentieth  century  that  the  recipients  of  charity  appear  to  be  morally deserving to those voluntarily dispensing the charity. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">"Subsidies, windfalls, and the prospect of economic opportunity remove</i> <i class="calibre3">the  immediacy  of</i> <i class="calibre3">needing  to  conserve.  The  mantras  of  democracy</i> <i class="calibre3">redistribution, and economic development raise</i> <i class="calibre3">expectations and fertility</i> <i class="calibre3">rates,  fostering  population  growth  and  thereby  steepening  a  downward</i> <i class="calibre3">environmental and economic spiral." </i> VIRGINIA ABERNATHY</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  some  ways  the  new  information  world  will  be  better  positioned  to encourage  seriousness  over  moral  issues.  The  promises  of  income redistribution  that  enflamed  expectations  among  the  unlucky  and unsuccessful in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe have also had a perverse effect internationally. There is strong evidence suggesting that  foreign  aid  and  promises  of  intervention  to  forestall  famine  and increase living standards have been major factors stimulating population growth that exceeds the carrying capacities of backward economies. The startling growth of world population since World War II, with its often destructive impact on forests, soils, and water resources, can be traced to intervention on a global scale. This intervention short-307</p>

<p class="calibre1">circuited  the  negative  feedback  consequences  that  had  long  kept  local populations in balance with the resources needed to support them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, many who lived in local environments with few resources and little or no growth were only too pleased to be assured that constraining limitations of their village life could be put aside. </p>

<p class="calibre1">492</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-494"></a>They eagerly adopted the optimistic message carried by international aid workers,  Peace  Corps  volunteers,  local  revolutionaries,  and  the competing ideologues of the Cold War, who told one and all that a better day lay ahead. This was precisely the wrong message. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An important consequence of redistribution among cultures has been to make  those  who  lived  in  nonindustrial  civilizations  and  adhered  to nonindustrial  values  artificially  competitive.  International  aid,  rescue missions to counter famine and disease, and technical intervention fooled many  into  believing  that  their  life  prospects  had  sharply  improved-without  the  necessity  on  their  part  of  updating  their  values  or significantly altering their behavior. </p>

<p class="calibre1">International income redistribution not only encouraged an unsustainable surge  in  the  world's  population,  it  contributed  in  important  ways  to cultural  relativism  and  widespread  confusion  over  the  crucial  role  of culture  in  fitting  people  to  prosper  in  their  local  environment.  Today most people believe that cultures are more matters of taste than sources of guidance for behavior that can mislead as well as inform. We are too keen to believe that all cultures are created equal, too slow to recognize the  drawbacks  of  counterproductive  cultures.  This  is  especially  true  of the hybrid cultures that have begun to emerge in the hothouse of subsidy and  intervention  in  many  parts  of  the  world  in  this  century.  Like  the criminal subculture of America's inner cities, they retain incoherent bits and  pieces  of  cultures  appropriate  to  earlier  stages  of  economic development,  and  combine  them  with  values  for  informing  behavior  in the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Information Revolution, therefore, will not merely release the spirit of genius, it will also unleash the spirit of nemesis. Both will contest as never before in the millennium to come. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  shift  from  an  Industrial  to  an  Information  Society  is  bound  to  be breathtaking. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  transition  from  one  stage  of  economic  life  to  another  has  always involved a revolution. We think that the Information Revolution is likely to be the most far-reaching of all. </p>

<p class="calibre1">493</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-495"></a>It  will  reorganize  life  more  thoroughly  than  either  the  Agricultural Revolution or the Industrial Revolution. And its impact will be felt in a fraction of the time. Fasten your seat belts. </p>

<p class="calibre1">494</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-496"></a><b class="calibre4">IMPLICATIONS AND STRATEGIES</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">"Of all 36 ways to get out of trouble, the best way is - leave." </p>

<p class="calibre1">495</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-497"></a><b class="calibre4">CHINESE PROVERB</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">The  argument  of  this  book  has  many  unorthodox  implications  for achieving  financial  independence  in  the  Information  Age.  Among  the more important: 1. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Citizenship is obsolete. To optimize your lifetime earnings and become a Sovereign  Individual,  you  will  need  to  become  a  customer  of  a government or protection service rather than a citizen. Instead of paying whatever  tax  burden  is  imposed  upon  you  by  grasping  politicians,  you must  place  yourself  in  a  position  to  negotiate  a  private  tax  treaty  that obliges  you  to  pay  no  more  for  services  of  government  than  they  are actually worth to you. </p>

<p class="calibre1">2. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of all the nationalities on the globe, U.S. citizenship conveys the greatest liabilities  and  places  the  most  hindrances  in  the  way  of  becoming  a Sovereign Individual. The American seeking financial independence will therefore obtain other passports as a necessary step toward privatizing or denationalizing himself. If you are not an American, it is economically irrational  to  become  a  resident  of  the  United  States  and  thus  expose yourself to predatory U.S. taxes, including exit taxes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">3. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Based upon the history of other dominant systems facing collapse, those who opt for the ultimum refugium and get out early will be better off in the end. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The dangers of a nationalist reaction to the crisis of the nationstate make it important not to underestimate the scope for tyranny and mischief. You should never leave your money in any jurisdiction that claims the right to conscript you, your children, or grandchildren. </p>

<p class="calibre1">4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">496</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-498"></a>Whatever your current residence or nationality, to optimize your wealth you should primarily reside in a country other than that from which you hold your first passport, while keeping the bulk of your money in yet a third jurisdiction, preferably a tax haven. </p>

<p class="calibre1">5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You  should  travel  widely  to  select  alternative  residences  in  attractive locales where you will have right of entry in an emergency. </p>

<p class="calibre1">6. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Violence will become more random and localized; organized crime will grow  in  scope.  It  will  therefore  be  more  important  to  locate  in  secure physical  spaces  than  in  the  twentieth  century.  Protection  will  be  more technological 309</p>

<p class="calibre1">than  juridical.  Walling  out  troublemakers  is  an  effective  as  well  as traditional way of minimizing criminal violence in times of weak central authority. </p>

<p class="calibre1">7. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If  you  are  financially  successful,  you  should  probably  hire  your  own retainers  to  guarantee  your  protection  against  criminals,  protection rackets,  and  the  covert  mischief  of  governments.  Police  functions  will increasingly  be  filled  by  private  guards  linked  to  merchant  and community associations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">8. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Areas of opportunity and security will shift. Economies that have been rich during the Industrial Era may well be subject to deflation of living standards  and  social  unrest  as  governments  prove  incapable  of guaranteeing prosperity and entitlement programs collapse. </p>

<p class="calibre1">9. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The forty-eight least-developed countries, comprising some 550 million persons  with  per  capita  income  of  less  than  $500  per  head,  will  have 497</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-499"></a>widely  divergent  fates  in  the  information  Age.  Most  will  become  even more  marginalized  and  desperate,  providing  a  venue  for  only  the  most intrepid  investors.  But  those  that  can  overcome  structural  problems  to preserve  public  health  and  order  stand  to  benefit  from  rapid  income growth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">10. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jurisdictions  of  choice  in  which  to  enjoy  high  living  standards  with economic opportunity include reform areas in the Southern hemisphere, such  as  New  Zealand,  Chile,  and  Argentina,  which  boast  adequate  to superior infrastructure and many beautiful landscapes and are unlikely to be targets of terrorists wielding nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. </p>

<p class="calibre1">11. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  fastest-growing  and  most  important  new  economy  of  the  next century will not be China but the cybereconomy. To take full advantage of  it,  you  will  need  to  place  your  business  or  profession  on  the  World Wide Web. </p>

<p class="calibre1">12. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Encryption will be an important feature of commerce on the Web and the realization of individual autonomy. You should acquire and begin using strong  encryption  immediately.  Just  as  the  church  attempted  to  ban printing  at  the  twilight  of  the  Middle  Ages,  so  the  United  States  and other aggressive governments bent on control will seek to bar effective encryption.  As  happened  five  centuries  ago,  this  may  merely  drive  the taboo  technology  into  areas  where  the  writ  of  established  authority  is weakest,  assuring  that  it  will  be  put  to  its  most  subversive  use  in undermining state control everywhere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">13. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Where  possible,  all  businesses  should  be  domiciled  offshore  in  a  tax-haven  jurisdiction.  This  is  particularly  important  for  Websites  and Internet addresses, where there is virtually no advantage in locating in an onshore, high-tax jurisdiction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">498</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-500"></a>14. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Corporations  in  the  Information  Age  will  increasingly  become  "virtual corporations"  -  bundles  of  contracting  relations  without  any  material reality,  and  perhaps  without  physical  assets.  The  virtual  corporation should be domiciled with an offshore trust to minimize tax liabilities. </p>

<p class="calibre1">15. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Incomes will become more unequal within jurisdictions but more equal between them. Countries with a tradition of a very unequal distribution of  incomes  may  be  relatively  more  stable  under  these  conditions  than those 310</p>

<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions  where  strong  expectations  of  income  equality  have developed in the Industrial period. </p>

<p class="calibre1">16. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As a relative performance becomes more important than absolute output in determining compensation, an ever more important occupation will be that of the agent, not merely for the highly paid performer, like a football star or an opera singer, but also for persons of modest skills, who may welcome help in landing a paying position. </p>

<p class="calibre1">17. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Jobs"  will  increasingly  become  tasks  or  "piece  work"  rather  than positions within an organization. </p>

<p class="calibre1">18. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  members  of  regulated  professions  will  be  displaced  by  digital servants employing interactive information-retrieval systems. </p>

<p class="calibre1">19. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Control  over  resources  will  shift  away  from  the  state  to  persons  of superior skills and intelligence, as more wealth will be created by adding knowledge to products. </p>

<p class="calibre1">499</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-501"></a>20. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  Professor  Guy  Bois  observed  in  his  history,  <i class="calibre3">The  Transformation  of</i> <i class="calibre3">the</i> <i class="calibre3">Year  One  Thousand</i>,  "in  a  period  of  increasing  difficulties,  the weaker elements in the social body tend to polarize around a rising star."' </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the transformation of the year two thousand, the rising star will be the Sovereign Individual. As the nationstate system breaks down, risk-averse persons who formerly would have sought employment with government may find an alternative in affiliating as retainers to the very rich. </p>

<p class="calibre1">21. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You should expect a slowdown or decline in per capita consumption in countries  such  as  the  United  States,  which  have  been  the  leading consumers of the world's products in the late stages of industrialism. </p>

<p class="calibre1">22. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Debt deflation may accompany the transition to the new millennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1">23. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  death  of  politics  will  mean  the  end  of  central  bank  regulation  and manipulation of money. Cybermoney will become the new money of the Information  Age,  replacing  the  paper  money  of  Industrialism.  This means not only a change in the fortunes of banknote printers, it implies the  death  of  inflation  as  an  effective  means  by  which  nationstates  can commandeer resources. Real interest rates will tend to rise. </p>

<p class="calibre1">24. </p>

<p class="calibre1">While  the  experience  of  the  nineteenth  century  proves  that  long-term growth  can  proceed  apace  even  while  deflation  raises  the  value  of money,  business  and  investment  strategies  must  be  adjusted  to  the unfamiliar realities of deflation-that is, debt should be avoided; savings and  cost  reductions  should  be  pursued  with  greater  urgency;  long-term contracts  and  compensation  packages  should  probably  be  drawn  with flexible nominal terms. </p>

<p class="calibre1">25. </p>

<p class="calibre1">500</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-502"></a>Taxing  capacity  in  the  leading  nationstates  will  fall  away  by  50  to  70</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent,  while  it  will  prove  far  more  difficult  to  reduce  spending  in  an orderly way. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The result to be expected is a continuation of deficits that plague most OECD</p>

<p class="calibre1">countries, accompanied by high real-interest rates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">26. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Technical  innovations  that  displace  employment  should  probably  be introduced in jurisdictions that have no tradition of producing whatever product or service is in question. </p>

<p class="calibre1">311</p>

<p class="calibre1">27. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Cognitive  skills  will  be  rewarded  as  never  before.  It  will  be  more important to think clearly, as ideas will become a form of wealth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">28. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thinking about the end of the current system is taboo. To understand the great  transformation  to  the  Information  Age,  you  must  transcend conventional thinking and conventional information sources. </p>

<p class="calibre1">29. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Because  incomes  for  the  very  rich  will  rise  faster  than  for  others  in advanced  economies,  an  area  of  growing  demand  will  be  services  and products that cater to the needs of the very rich. </p>

<p class="calibre1">30. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  growing  danger  of  crime,  particularly  embezzlement  and undetectable theft, will make morality and honor among associates more crucial  and  highly  valued  than  it  was  during  the  Industrial  Era, particularly in its waning years. </p>
