<p class="calibre1">done  together  on  various  aspects  of  the  great  transformation  to  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">we  should  probably  repeat  al   of  our  acknowledgments  to  the  friends  and</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-464"></a>PREFACE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medieval men despaired of the wil . They thought of humans as wounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">and weak. But they respected the intel ect. They thought even humans, if we</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  careful y,  have  the  power  to  answer  the  most  profound  questions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">God and the Universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern  men  worship  the  wil ,  but  they  despair  of  the  intel ect.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom  of  crowds;  the  swerve  of  random  particles;  the  in uence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconscious biases: al  of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about</p>
<p class="calibre1">intel ectual weakness&mdash;or ways to talk ourselves into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord  Wil iam  Rees-Mogg  and  James  Dale  Davidson  do  not  promise</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers  about  God  and  the  Universe,  nor  do  they  supply  any.  But  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigation of “megapolitics”&mdash;an anatomy of the forces at work in history</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  a  set  of  predictions  for  the  near  future&mdash;is  unusual,  or  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">countercultural,  because  it  applies  human  reason  to  matters  that  we  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been taught to leave to chance or fate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking back almost a quarter century after the  rst publication of  <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sovereign Individual</i>, the easiest thing to do, and the thing most encouraged</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the culture around us, is to look at what they got wrong&mdash;almost as if to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reassure  ourselves  that  there  was  no  point  al   along  in  thinking  careful y</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  of  course,  there  are  some  things  they  missed:  above  al ,  the  rise  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">China.  The  twenty- rst-century  People’s  Republic  of  China  under  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communist Party has created its very own version of the Information Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  decidedly  nationalist,  ethnical y  homogenous,  profoundly  statist</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics.  This  is  probably  the  single  biggest  “megapolitical” </p>
<p class="calibre1">development  since  the  book  came  out.  To  cite  just  one  key  il ustration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Communist China has crushed the city-state of Hong Kong&mdash;whereas Rees-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mogg and Davidson had described Hong Kong as “a mental model of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of jurisdiction that we expect to see  ourish in the Information Age.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-471"></a>On  one  account,  this  is  a  blind  spot  on  the  part  of  the  authors.  On</p>
<p class="calibre1">another view, it can seem like China’s Politburo must have been keen readers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  <i class="calibre4">The Sovereign Individual</i>. It is only through a unique long-term awareness</p>
<p class="calibre1">that looks back to Lenin and Stalin as wel  as forward to the Information Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the Party’s leaders prevailed amid the trends analyzed by this book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those trends&mdash;winner-take-al  economics, jurisdictional competition, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shift away from mass production, and the arguable obsolescence of interstate</p>
<p class="calibre1">warfare&mdash;are stil  at work today. The rise of China is less a refutation of Rees-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mogg and Davidson than a dramatic raising of the stakes they described. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  truth,  the  great  con ict  over  our  megapolitical  future  is  only  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning. On the dimension of technology, the con ict has two poles: AI</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  crypto.  Arti cial  Intel igence  holds  out  the  prospect  of  nal y  solving</p>
<p class="calibre1">what economists cal  the “calculation problem”: AI could theoretical y make</p>
<p class="calibre1">it possible to central y control an entire economy. It is no coincidence that AI</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  the  favorite  technology  of  the  Communist  Party  of  China.  Strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">cryptography, at the other pole, holds out the prospect of a decentralized and</p>
<p class="calibre1">individualized world. If AI is communist, crypto is libertarian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The future may lie somewhere between these two extreme poles. But we</p>
<p class="calibre1">know the actions we take today wil  determine the overal  outcome. Reading</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Sovereign Individual</i> in 2020 is a way to think careful y about the future</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  your  own  actions  wil   help  to  create.  It  is  an  opportunity  not  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;DANNY HILLIS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PREMONITIONS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The coming of the year 2000 has haunted the Western imagination for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past thousand years. Ever since the world failed to end at the turn of the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium after Christ, theologians, evangelists, poets, seers, and now, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer  programmers  have  looked  to  the  end  of  this  decade  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation that it would bring something momentous. No less an authority</p>
<p class="calibre1">than Isaac Newton speculated that the world would end with the year 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michel  de  Nostradamus,  whose  prophecies  have  been  read  by  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation since they were  rst published in 1568, forecast the coming of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Third Antichrist in July 1999. <a href="#calibre_link-1">2 </a>Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, connoisseur of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  “col ective  unconscious,”  envisioned  the  birth  of  a  New  Age  in  1997. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  forecasts  may  easily  be  ridiculed.  And  so  can  the  sober  forecasts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economists, such as Dr. Edward Yardeni of Deutsche Bank Securities, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">expects computer  malfunctions  on  the  mil ennial  midnight  to  “disrupt  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire global economy.” <a href="#calibre_link-1">3 </a>But whether you view the Y2K computer problem</p>
<p class="calibre1">as groundless hysteria ginned up by computer programmers and Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-36"></a>Technology  consultants  to  stir  up  business,  or  as  a  mysterious  instance  of technology unfolding in concert with the prophetic imagination, there is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">denying that circumstances at the eve of the mil ennium excite more than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual morbid doubt about where the world is tending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sense of disquiet about the future has begun to color the optimism so</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristic of Western societies for the past 250 years. People everywhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  hesitant  and  worried.  You  see  it  in  their  faces.  Hear  it  in  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation. See it re ected in pol s and registered in the bal ot box. Just as</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  invisible,  physical  change  of  ions  in  the  atmosphere  signals  that  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderstorm  is  imminent  even  before  the  clouds  darken  and  lightning</p>
<p class="calibre1">strikes, so now, in the twilight of the mil ennium, premonitions of change are</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the air. One person after another, each in his own way, senses that time is</p>
<p class="calibre1">running  out  on  a  dying  way  of  life.  As  the  decade  expires,  a  murderous</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  expires  with  it,  and  also  a  glorious  mil ennium  of  human</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment. Al  draw to a close with the year 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">be known.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;MATTHEW 10:26</p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that the modern phase of Western civilization wil  end with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This book tel s why. Like many earlier works, it is an attempt to see into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass darkly, to sketch out the vague shapes and dimensions of a future that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil  to be. In that sense, we mean our work to be apocalyptic&mdash;in the original</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning  of  the  word.  <i class="calibre4">Apokalypsis</i>  means  “unveiling”  in  Greek.  We  believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a new stage in history&mdash;the Information Age&mdash;is about to be “unveiled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“We  are  watching  the  beginnings  of  a  new  logical  space,  an  instantaneous</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">electronic everywhereness, which we may all access, enter into, and experience. We</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">have,  in  short,  the  beginnings  of  a  new  kind  of  community.  The  virtual</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">community becomes the model for a secular Kingdom of Heaven; as Jesus said</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">there were many mansions in his Father’s Kingdom, so there are many virtual</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">communities, each reflecting their own needs and desires.” </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE FOURTH STAGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">10</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-472"></a>The theme of this book is the new revolution of power which is liberating</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals at the expense of the twentieth-century nation-state. Innovations</p>
<p class="calibre1">that alter the logic of violence in unprecedented ways are transforming the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boundaries within which the future must lie. If our deductions are correct, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you stand at the threshold of the most sweeping revolution in history. Faster</p>
<p class="calibre1">than al  but a few now imagine, microprocessing wil  subvert and destroy the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state, creating new forms of social organization in the process. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  be far from an easy transformation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chal enge it wil  pose wil  be al  the greater because it wil  happen with</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredible  speed  compared  with  anything  seen  in  the  past.  Through  al   of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human history from its earliest beginnings until now, there have been only</p>
<p class="calibre1">three  basic  stages  of  economic  life:  (1)  hunting-and-gathering  societies;  (2)</p>
<p class="calibre1">agricultural  societies;  and  (3)  industrial  societies.  Now,  looming  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon,  is  something  entirely  new,  the  fourth  stage  of  social  organization:</p>
<p class="calibre1">information societies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each  of  the  previous  stages  of  society  has  corresponded  with  distinctly</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent  phases  in  the  evolution  and  control  of  violence.  As  we  explain  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">detail,  information  societies  promise  to  dramatical y  reduce  the  returns  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence,  in  part  because  they  transcend  locality.  The  virtual  reality  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace,  what  novelist  Wil iam  Gibson  characterized  as  a  “consensual</p>
<p class="calibre1">hal ucination,” wil  be as far beyond the reach of bul ies as imagination can</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  it.  In  the  new  mil ennium,  the  advantage  of  control ing  violence  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  scale  wil   be  far  lower  than  it  has  been  at  any  time  since  before  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">French Revolution. This wil  have profound consequences. One of these wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  rising  crime.  When  the  payo   for  organizing  violence  at  a  large  scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumbles, the payo  from violence at a smal er scale is likely to jump. Violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  become more random and localized. Organized crime wil  grow in scope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We explain why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another logical implication of fal ing returns to violence is the eclipse of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics,  which  is  the  stage  for  crime  on  the  largest  scale.  There  is  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence that adherence to the civic myths of the twentieth-century nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">state  is  rapidly  eroding.  The  death  of  Communism  is  merely  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">striking example. As we explore in detail, the col apse of morality and growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruption  among  leaders  of  Western  governments  are  not  random</p>
<p class="calibre1">developments.  They  are  evidence  that  the  potential  of  the  nation-state  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-37"></a>exhausted.  Even  many  of  its  leaders  no  longer  believe  the  platitudes  they mouth. Nor are they believed by others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">History Repeats Itself</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a situation with striking paral els in the past. Whenever technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">change  has  divorced  the  old  forms  from  the  new  moving  forces  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy, moral standards shift, and people begin to treat those in command</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the old institutions with growing disdain. This widespread revulsion often</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes into evidence wel  before people develop a new coherent ideology of</p>
<p class="calibre1">change. So it was in the late  fteenth century, when the medieval Church was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the predominant institution of feudalism. Notwithstanding popular belief in</p>
<p class="calibre1">“the sacredness of the sacerdotal o ce,” both the higher and lower ranks of</p>
<p class="calibre1">clergy were held in the utmost contempt&mdash;not unlike the popular attitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward politicians and bureaucrats today<a href="#calibre_link-1">.5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that much can be learned by analogy between the situation at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the  fteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by organized religion, and the situation today, when the world has become</p>
<p class="calibre1">saturated with politics. The costs of supporting institutionalized religion at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the  fteenth century had reached a historic extreme, much as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs of supporting government have reached a senile extreme today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  know  what  happened  to  organized  religion  in  the  wake  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gunpowder  Revolution.  Technological  developments  created  strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentives to downsize religious institutions and lower their costs. A similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological  revolution  is  destined  to  downsize  radical y  the  nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">early in the new mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">organization of social institutions. This means that provinces and even cities</p>
<p class="calibre1">that can e ectively uphold property rights and provide for the administration</p>
<p class="calibre1">of justice, while consuming few resources, wil  be viable sovereignties in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  as  they  general y  have  not  been  during  the  last  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries. An entirely new realm of economic activity that is not hostage to</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical violence wil  emerge in cyberspace. The most obvious bene ts wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">ow to the “cognitive elite,” who wil  increasingly operate outside political</p>
<p class="calibre1">boundaries.  They  are  already  equal y  at  home  in  Frankfurt,  London,  New</p>
<p class="calibre1">York,  Buenos  Aires,  Los  Angeles,  Tokyo,  and  Hong  Kong.  Incomes  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">become more unequal within jurisdictions and more equal between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Sovereign Individual</i> explores the social and  nancial consequences of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this revolutionary change. Our desire is to help you to take advantage of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities of the new age and avoid being destroyed by its impact. If only</p>
<p class="calibre1">half of what we expect to see happens, you face change of a magnitude with</p>
<p class="calibre1">few precedents in history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  transformation  of  the  year  2000  wil   not  only  revolutionize  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">character of the world economy, it wil  do so more rapidly than any previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">phase  change.  Unlike  the  Agricultural  Revolution,  the  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution  wil   not  take  mil ennia  to  do  its  work.  Unlike  the  Industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution,  its  impact  wil   not  be  spread  over  centuries.  The  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution wil  happen within a lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  is  more,  it  wil   happen  almost  everywhere  at  once.  Technical  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  innovations  wil   no  longer  be  con ned  to  smal   portions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">globe. The transformation wil  be al  but universal. And it wil  involve a break</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the past so profound that it wil  almost bring to life the magical domain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  gods  as  imagined  by  the  early  agricultural  peoples  like  the  ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greeks. To a greater degree than most would now be wil ing to concede, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  prove di cult or impossible to preserve many contemporary institutions</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the new mil ennium. When information societies take shape they wil  be as</p>

<p class="calibre1">The coming transformation is both good news and bad. The good news is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the Information Revolution wil  liberate individuals as never before. For</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  rst time, those who can educate and motivate themselves wil  be almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely  free  to  invent  their  own  work  and  realize  the  ful   bene ts  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own productivity. Genius wil  be unleashed, freed from both the oppression</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  government  and  the  drags  of  racial  and  ethnic  prejudice.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Society,  no  one  who  is  truly  able  wil   be  detained  by  the  il -</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed  opinions  of  others.  It  wil   not  matter  what  most  of  the  people  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth might think of your race, your looks, your age, your sexual proclivities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or the way you wear your hair. In the cybereconomy, they wil  never see you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ugly, the fat, the old, the disabled wil  vie with the young and beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  equal  terms  in  utterly  color-blind  anonymity  on  the  new  frontiers  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Ideas Become Wealth</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Merit, wherever it arises, wil  be rewarded as never before. In an environment</p>
<p class="calibre1">where the greatest source of wealth wil  be the ideas you have in your head</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly wil  potential y</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  rich.  The  Information  Age  wil   be  the  age  of  upward  mobility.  It  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">a ord far more equal opportunity for the bil ions of humans in parts of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  that  never  shared  ful y  in  the  prosperity  of  industrial  society.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightest,  most  successful  and  ambitious  of  these  wil   emerge  as  truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign Individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  rst, only a handful wil  achieve ful   nancial sovereignty. But this does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  negate  the  advantages  of  nancial  independence.  The  fact  that  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone  attains  an  equal y  vast  fortune  does  not  mean  that  it  is  futile  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaningless  to  become  rich.  There  are  25,000  mil ionaires  for  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">bil ionaire. If you are a mil ionaire and not a bil ionaire, that does not make</p>
<p class="calibre1">14</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-305"></a>you poor. Equal y, in the future, one of the milestones by which you measure</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  nancial success wil  be not just now many zeroes you can add to your</p>
<p class="calibre1">net worth, but whether you can structure your a airs in a way that enables</p>
<p class="calibre1">you to realize ful  individual autonomy and independence. The more clever</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  are,  the  less  propulsion  you  wil   require  to  achieve  nancial  escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">velocity.  Persons  of  even  quite  modest  means  wil   soar,  as  the  gravitational</p>
<p class="calibre1">pul   of  politics  on  the  global  economy  weakens.  Unprecedented  nancial</p>
<p class="calibre1">independence  wil   be  a  reachable  goal  in  your  lifetime  or  that  of  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  highest  plateau  of  productivity,  these  Sovereign  Individuals  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">compete  and  interact  on  terms  that  echo  the  relations  among  the  gods  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greek myth. The elusive Mount Olympus of the next mil ennium wil  be in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace&mdash;a realm without physical existence that wil  nonetheless develop</p>
<p class="calibre1">what promises to be the world’s largest economy by the second decade of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  mil ennium.  By  2025,  the  cybereconomy  wil   have  many  mil ions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">participants. Some of them wil  be as rich as Bil  Gates, worth tens of bil ions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  dol ars  each.  The  cyberpoor  may  be  those  with  an  income  of  less  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">$200,000  a  year.  There  wil   be  no  cyberwelfare.  No  cybertaxes  and  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybergovernment. The cybereconomy, rather than China, could wel  be the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest economic phenomenon of the next thirty years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  good  news  is  that  politicians  wil   no  more  be  able  to  dominate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suppress, and regulate the greater part of commerce in this new realm than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the legislators of the ancient Greek city-states could have trimmed the beard</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Zeus. That is good news for the rich. And even better news for the not so</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich. The obstacles and burdens that politics imposes are more obstacles to</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming  rich  than  to  being  rich.  The  bene ts  of  declining  returns  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence and devolving jurisdictions wil  create scope for every energetic and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambitious person to bene t from the death of politics. Even the consumers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  services  wil   bene t  as  entrepreneurs  extend  the  bene ts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition.  Heretofore,  competition  between  jurisdictions  has  usual y</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant competition by means of violence to enforce the rule of a predominant</p>
<p class="calibre1">group.  Consequently,  much  of  the  ingenuity  of  interjurisdictional</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  was  channeled  into  military  endeavor.  But  the  advent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy  wil   bring  competition  on  new  terms  to  provision  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  services.  A  proliferation  of  jurisdictions  wil   mean  proliferating</p>
<p class="calibre1">15</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-38"></a>experimentation in new ways of enforcing contracts and otherwise securing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the safety of persons and property. The liberation of a large part of the global</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy from political control wil  oblige whatever remains of government</p>
<p class="calibre1">as we have known it to operate on more nearly market terms. Governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  ultimately have little choice but to treat populations in territories they</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve more like customers, and less in the way that organized criminals treat</p>
<p class="calibre1">the victims of a shakedown racket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Beyond Politics</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What mythology described as the province of the gods wil  become a viable</p>
<p class="calibre1">option for the individual&mdash;a life outside the reach of kings and councils. First</p>
<p class="calibre1">in scores, then in hundreds, and ultimately in the mil ions, individuals wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape the shackles of politics. As they do, they wil  transform the character</p>
<p class="calibre1">of governments, shrinking the realm of compulsion and widening the scope</p>
<p class="calibre1">of private control over resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emergence of the sovereign individual wil  demonstrate yet again the</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange prophetic power of myth. Conceiving little of the laws of nature, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early agricultural peoples imagined that “powers we should cal  supernatural” </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  widely  distributed.  These  powers  were  sometimes  employed  by  men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes by “incarnate human gods” who looked like men and interacted</p>
<p class="calibre1">with them in what Sir James George Frazer described in  <i class="calibre4">The Golden Bough</i> as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“a great democracy. <a href="#calibre_link-1">”7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the ancients imagined the children of Zeus living among them they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  inspired  by  a  deep  belief  in  magic.  They  shared  with  other  primitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">agricultural  peoples  an  awe  of  nature,  and  a  superstitious  conviction  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature’s works were set in motion by individual volition, by magic. In that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense, there was nothing self-consciously prophetic about their view of nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">and their gods. They were far from anticipating microtechnology. They could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  have  imagined  its  impact  in  altering  the  marginal  productivity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals thousands of years later. They certainly could not have foreseen</p>
<p class="calibre1">how  it  would  shift  the  balance  between  power  and  e ciency  and  thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolutionize  the  way  that  assets  are  created  and  protected.  Yet  what  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined as they spun their myths has a strange resonance with the world you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are likely to see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-341"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Alt. Abracadabra</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  “abracadabra”  of  the  magic  invocation,  for  example,  bears  a  curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">similarity to the password employed to access a computer. In some respects, </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-speed computation has already made it possible to mimic the magic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the genie. Early generations of “digital servants” already obey the commands</p>
<p class="calibre1">of those who control the computers in which they are sealed much as genies</p>
<p class="calibre1">were sealed in magic lamps. The virtual reality of information technology wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">widen  the  realm  of  human  wishes  to  make  almost  anything  that  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined seem real. Telepresence wil  give living individuals the same capacity</p>
<p class="calibre1">to span distance at supernatural speed and monitor events from afar that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greeks  supposed  was  enjoyed  by  Hermes  and  Apol o.  The  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals  of  the  Information  Age,  like  the  gods  of  ancient  and  primitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">myths, wil  in due course enjoy a kind of “diplomatic immunity” from most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the political woes that have beset mortal human beings in most times and</p>
<p class="calibre1">places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new Sovereign Individual wil  operate like the gods of myth in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same physical environment as the ordinary, subject citizen, but in a separate</p>
<p class="calibre1">realm political y. Commanding vastly greater resources and beyond the reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  many  forms  of  compulsion,  the  Sovereign  Individual  wil   redesign</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  and  recon gure  economies  in  the  new  mil ennium.  The  ful</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications of this change are al  but unimaginable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Genius and Nemesis</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For  anyone  who  loves  human  aspiration  and  success,  the  Information  Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  provide a bounty. That is surely the best news in many generations. But it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is bad news as wel . The new organization of society implied by the triumph</p>
<p class="calibre1">of individual autonomy and the true equalization of opportunity based upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">merit wil  lead to very great rewards for merit and great individual autonomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This wil  leave individuals far more responsible for themselves than they have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been accustomed to being during the industrial period. It wil  also precipitate</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition  crises,  including  a  possibly  severe  economic  depression  that  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduce the unearned advantage in living standards that has been enjoyed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">residents of advanced industrial societies throughout the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we write, the top 15 percent of the world’s population have an average</p>
<p class="calibre1">17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-394"></a>per-capita  income  of  $21,000  annual y.  The  remaining  85  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world have an average income of just $1,000. That huge, hoarded advantage</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  past  is  bound  to  dissipate  under  the  new  conditions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it does, the capacity of nation-states to redistribute income on a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale wil  col apse. Information technology facilitates dramatical y increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  between  jurisdictions.  When  technology  is  mobile,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions  occur  in  cyberspace,  as  they  increasingly  wil   do,  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  no longer be able to charge more for their services than they are worth to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  people  who  pay  for  them.  Anyone  with  a  portable  computer  and  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">satel ite  link  wil   be  able  to  conduct  almost  any  information  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere,  and  that  includes  almost  the  whole  of  the  world’s  multitril ion-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dol ar  nancial transactions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  means  that  you  wil   no  longer  be  obliged  to  live  in  a  high-tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction in order to earn high income. In the future, when most wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">can be earned anywhere, and even spent anywhere, governments that attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">to charge too much as the price of domicile wil  merely drive away their best</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers. If our reasoning is correct, and we believe it is, the nation-state as</p>
<p class="calibre1">we know it wil  not endure in anything like its present form. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE END OF NATIONS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Changes  that  diminish  the  power  of  predominant  institutions  are  both</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsettling  and  dangerous.  Just  as  monarchs,  lords,  popes,  and  potentates</p>
<p class="calibre1">fought ruthlessly to preserve their accustomed privileges in the early stages of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the modern period, so today’s governments wil  employ violence, often of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">covert and arbitrary kind, in the attempt to hold back the clock. Weakened by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the chal enge from technology, the state wil  treat increasingly autonomous</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals,  its  former  citizens,  with  the  same  range  of  ruthlessness  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">diplomacy it has heretofore displayed in its dealing with other governments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  advent  of  this  new  stage  in  history  was  punctuated  with  a  bang  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">August 20, 1998, when the United States  red about $200 mil ion worth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tomahawk  BGM-109  sea-launched  cruise  missiles  at  targets  al egedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">associated  with  an  exiled  Saudi  mil ionaire,  Osama  bin  Laden.  Bin  Laden</p>
<p class="calibre1">became  the  rst  person  in  history  to  have  his  satel ite  phone  targeted  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">18</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-4"></a>attack  by  cruise  missiles.  Simultaneously,  the  United  States  destroyed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pharmaceutical  plant  in  Khartoum,  Sudan,  in  Bin  Laden’s  honor.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergence of Bin Laden as the enemy-in-chief of the United States re ects a</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentous change in the nature of warfare. A single individual, albeit one</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  hundreds  of  mil ions  of  dol ars,  can  now  be  depicted  as  a  plausible</p>
<p class="calibre1">threat  to  the  greatest  military  power  of  the  Industrial  era.  In  statements</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminiscent of propaganda employed during the Cold War about the Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union, the United States president and his national security aides portrayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bin Laden, a private individual, as a transnational terrorist and leading enemy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  same  military  logic  that  has  seen  Osama  bin  Laden  elevated  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">position  as  the  chief  enemy  of  the  United  States  wil   assert  itself  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments’  internal  relations  with  their  subjects.  Increasingly  harsh</p>
<p class="calibre1">techniques of exaction wil  be a logical corol ary of the emergence of a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">type  of  bargaining  between  governments  and  individuals.  Technology  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">make  individuals  more  nearly  sovereign  than  ever  before.  And  they  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">treated that way. Sometimes violently, as enemies, sometimes as equal parties</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  negotiation,  sometimes  as  al ies.  But  however  ruthlessly  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">behave, particularly in the transition period, wedding the IRS with the CIA</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   avail  them  little.  They  wil   be  increasingly  required  by  the  press  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessity  to  bargain  with  autonomous  individuals  whose  resources  wil   no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be so easily control ed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The changes implied by the Information Revolution wil  not only create a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scal crisis for governments, they wil  tend to disintegrate al  large structures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourteen  empires  have  disappeared  already  in  the  twentieth  century.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakdown of empires is part of a process that wil  dissolve the nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself.  Government  wil   have  to  adapt  to  the  growing  autonomy  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual. Taxing capacity wil  plunge by 50-70 percent. This wil  tend to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make  smal er  jurisdictions  more  successful.  The  chal enge  of  setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  terms  to  attract  able  individuals  and  their  capital  wil   be  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily undertaken in enclaves than across continents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  as  the  modern  nation-state  decomposes,  latter-day</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbarians wil  increasingly come to exercise power behind the scenes. Groups</p>
<p class="calibre1">like the Russian ma ya, which picks the bones of the former Soviet Union, </p>
<p class="calibre1">other ethnic criminal gangs, nomenklaturas<a href="#calibre_link-2">,I </a>drug lords, and renegade covert</p>
<p class="calibre1">19</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-39"></a>agencies  wil   be  laws  unto  themselves.  They  already  are.  Far  more  than  is widely understood, the modern barbarians have already in ltrated the forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the nation-state without greatly changing its appearances. They are micro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">parasites feeding on a dying system. As violent and unscrupulous as a state at</p>
<p class="calibre1">war, these groups employ the techniques of the state on a smal er scale. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing  in uence  and  power  are  part  of  the  downsizing  of  politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microprocessing  reduces  the  size  that  groups  must  attain  in  order  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective in the use and control of violence. As this technological revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolds,  predatory  violence  wil   be  organized  more  and  more  outside  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">central  control.  E orts  to  contain  violence  wil   also  devolve  in  ways  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">depend more upon e ciency than magnitude of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">History in Reverse</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The process by which the nation-state grew over the past  ve centuries wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">put into reverse by the new logic of the Information Age. Local centers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  wil   reassert  themselves  as  the  state  devolves  into  fragmented, </p>
<p class="calibre1">overlapping sovereignties<a href="#calibre_link-1">.8</a> The growing power of organized crime is merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">one re ection of this tendency. Multinational companies are already having</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  subcontract  al   but  essential  work.  Some  conglomerates,  such  as  AT&amp;T, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unisys, and ITT, have split themselves into several  rms in order to function</p>
<p class="calibre1">more pro tably. The nation-state wil  devolve like an unwieldy conglomerate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but probably not before it is forced to do so by  nancial crises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only is power in the world changing, but the work of the world is</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing as wel . This means that the way business operates wil  inevitably</p>
<p class="calibre1">change. The “virtual corporation” is evidence of a sweeping transformation</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  nature  of  the  rm,  facilitated  by  the  drop  in  information  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction costs. We explore the implications of the Information Revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  dissolving  corporations  and  doing  away  with  the  “good  job.”  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  a  “job”  wil   be  a  task  to  do,  not  a  position  you  “have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microprocessing has created entirely new horizons of economic activity that</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcend  territorial  boundaries.  This  transcendence  of  frontiers  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">territories  is  perhaps  the  most  revolutionary  development  since  Adam  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eve straggled out of paradise under the sentence of their Maker: “In the sweat</p>
<p class="calibre1">of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” As technology revolutionizes the tools we</p>
<p class="calibre1">20</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-396"></a>use,  it  also  antiquates  our  laws,  reshapes  our  morals,  and  alters  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceptions. This book explains how. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microprocessing and rapidly improving communications already make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible  for  the  individual  to  choose  where  to  work.  Transactions  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internet or the World Wide Web can be encrypted and wil  soon be almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible for tax col ectors to capture. Tax-free money already compounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">far  faster  o shore  than  onshore  funds  stil   subject  to  the  high  tax  burden</p>
<p class="calibre1">imposed  by  the  twentieth-century  nation-state.  After  the  turn  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium, much of the world’s commerce wil  migrate into the new realm</p>
<p class="calibre1">of cyberspace, a region where governments wil  have no more dominion than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they exercise over the bottom of the sea or the outer planets. In cyberspace, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the threats of physical violence that have been the alpha and omega of politics</p>
<p class="calibre1">since time immemorial wil  vanish. In cyberspace, the meek and the mighty</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  meet on equal terms. Cyberspace is the ultimate o shore jurisdiction. An</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy with no taxes. Bermuda in the sky with diamonds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  this  greatest  tax  haven  of  them  al   is  ful y  open  for  business,  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">funds wil  essential y be o shore funds at the discretion of their owner. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   have  cascading  consequences.  The  state  has  grown  used  to  treating  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxpayers as a farmer treats his cows, keeping them in a  eld to be milked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, the cows wil  have wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Revenge of Nations</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like an angry farmer, the state wil  no doubt take desperate measures at  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">to tether and hobble its escaping herd. It wil  employ covert and even violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">means to restrict access to liberating technologies. Such expedients wil  work</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  temporarily,  if  at  al .  The  twentieth-century  nation-state,  with  al   its</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretensions, wil  starve to death as its tax revenues decline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the state  nds itself unable to meet its committed expenditure by</p>
<p class="calibre1">raising tax revenues, it wil  resort to other, more desperate measures. Among</p>
<p class="calibre1">them  is  printing  money.  Governments  have  grown  used  to  enjoying  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly  over  currency  that  they  could  depreciate  at  wil .  This  arbitrary</p>
<p class="calibre1">in ation  has  been  a  prominent  feature  of  the  monetary  policy  of  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth-century  states.  Even  the  best  national  currency  of  the  postwar</p>
<p class="calibre1">period, the German mark, lost 71 percent of its value from January 1, 1949, </p>
<p class="calibre1">21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>through  the  end  of  June  1995.  In  the  same  period,  the  U.S.  dol ar  lost  84</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of its value<a href="#calibre_link-1">.9</a> This in ation had the same e ect as a tax on al  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold  the  currency.  As  we  explore  later,  in ation  as  revenue  option  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">largely  foreclosed  by  the  emergence  of  cybermoney.  New  technologies  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">al ow  the  holders  of  wealth  to  bypass  the  national  monopolies  that  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">issued and regulated money in the modern period. Indeed, the credit crises</p>
<p class="calibre1">that swept through Asia, Russia, and other emerging economies in 1997 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">1998 attest to the fact that national currencies and national credit ratings are</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronisms inimical to the smooth operation of the global economy. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  the  fact  that  the  demands  of  sovereignty  require  al   transactions</p>
<p class="calibre1">within a jurisdiction to be denominated in a national currency that creates</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  vulnerability  to  mistakes  by  central  bankers  and  attacks  by  speculators</p>
<p class="calibre1">which precipitated de ationary crises in one jurisdiction after another. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  individuals  wil   be  able  to  use  cybercurrencies  and  thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">declare  their  monetary  independence.  When  individuals  can  conduct  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own monetary policies over the World Wide Web it wil  matter less or not at</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  that the state continues to control the industrial-era printing presses. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  for  control ing  the  world’s  wealth  wil   be  transcended  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">mathematical  algorithms  that  have  no  physical  existence.  In  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium,  cybermoney  control ed  by  private  markets  wil   supersede  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">money issued by governments. Only the poor wil  be victims of in ation and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensuing col apses into de ation that are consequences of the arti cial leverage</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  at money injects into the economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lacking their accustomed scope to tax and in ate, governments, even in</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional y  civil  countries,  wil   turn  nasty.  As  income  tax  becomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncol ectible,  older  and  more  arbitrary  methods  of  exaction  wil   resurface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ultimate form of withholding tax <i class="calibre4">&mdash;de facto</i> or even overt hostage-taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;  wil   be  introduced  by  governments  desperate  to  prevent  wealth  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping beyond their reach. Unlucky individuals wil   nd themselves singled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out and held to ransom in an almost medieval fashion. Businesses that o er</p>
<p class="calibre1">services  that  facilitate  the  realization  of  autonomy  by  individuals  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  to  in ltration,  sabotage,  and  disruption.  Arbitrary  forfeiture  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">property,  already  commonplace  in  the  United  States,  where  it  occurs  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand times a week, wil  become even more pervasive. Governments wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">violate  human  rights,  censor  the  free  ow  of  information,  sabotage  useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">22</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-306"></a>technologies, and worse. For the same reasons that the late, departed Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union  tried  in  vain  to  suppress  access  to  personal  computers  and  Xerox</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines, Western governments wil  seek to suppress the cybereconomy by</p>
<p class="calibre1">totalitarian means. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">RETURN OF THE LUDDITES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  methods  may  prove  popular  among  some  population  segments.  The</p>

<p class="calibre1">news to many who are frightened by the transition crisis and do not expect to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be winners in the new con guration of society. The apparent popularity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the draconian capital controls imposed in 1998 by Malaysian prime minister</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mahathir Mohamad in the wake of the Asian meltdown testi es to residual</p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiasm among many for the old-fashioned closed economy dominated by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nation-state.  This  nostalgia  for  the  past  wil   be  fed  by  resentments</p>
<p class="calibre1">in amed by the inevitable transition crisis. The greatest resentment is likely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be centered among those of middle talent in currently rich countries. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly may come to feel that information technology poses a threat to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  way  of  life.  The  bene ciaries  of  organized  compulsion,  including</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ions receiving income redistributed by governments, may resent the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">freedom  realized  by  Sovereign  Individuals.  Their  upset  wil   il ustrate  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">It would be misleading, however, to attribute al  the bad feelings that wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  generated  in  the  coming  transition  crisis  to  the  bald  desire  to  live  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone else’s expense. More wil  be involved. The very character of human</p>
<p class="calibre1">society suggests that there is bound to be a misguided moral dimension to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming  Luddite  reaction.  Think  of  it  as  a  bald  desire  tted  with  a  moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">23</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-377"></a>toupee.  We  explore  the  moral  and  moralistic  dimensions  of  the  transition</p>
<p class="calibre1">crisis.  Self-interested  grasping  of  a  conscious  kind  has  far  less  power  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivate actions than does self-righteous fury. While adherence to the civic</p>
<p class="calibre1">myths of the twentieth century is rapidly fal ing away, they are not without</p>
<p class="calibre1">their true believers. Many humans, as the passage quoted from Craig Lambert</p>
<p class="calibre1">attests, are belongers, who place importance on being members of a group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same need to identify that motivates fans of organized sports makes some</p>
<p class="calibre1">partisans of nations. Everyone who came of age in the twentieth century has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been inculcated in the duties and obligations of the twentieth-century citizen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The residual moral imperatives from industrial society wil  stimulate at least</p>
<p class="calibre1">some neo-Luddite attacks on information technologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this sense, this violence to come wil  be at least partial y an expression of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what we cal  “moral anachronism,” the application of moral strictures drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from one stage of economic life to the circumstances of another. Every stage</p>
<p class="calibre1">of society requires its own moral rules to help individuals overcome incentive</p>
<p class="calibre1">traps peculiar to the choices they face in that particular way of life. Just as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming society could not live by the moral rules of a migratory Eskimo band, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so the Information Society cannot satisfy moral imperatives that emerged to</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitate  the  success  of  a  militant  twentieth-century  industrial  state.  We</p>
<p class="calibre1">explain why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next few years, moral anachronism wil  be in evidence at the core</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  of  the  West  in  much  the  way  that  it  has  been  witnessed  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">periphery  over  the  past  ve  centuries.  Western  colonists  and  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">expeditions  stimulated  such  crises  when  they  encountered  indigenous</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunting-and-gathering  bands,  as  wel   as  peoples  whose  societies  were  stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  for  farming.  The  introduction  of  new  technologies  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronistic  settings  caused  confusion  and  moral  crises.  The  success  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian  missionaries  in  converting  mil ions  of  indigenous  peoples  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid in large measure to the local crises caused by the sudden introduction of</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  power  arrangements  from  the  outside.  Such  encounters  recurred  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  over,  from  the  sixteenth  century  through  the  early  decades  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century. We expect similar clashes early in the new mil ennium as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Societies supplant those organized along industrial lines. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Everyone wil  feel some misgivings. And many wil  despise innovations that</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermine the territorial nation-state. It is a fact of human nature that radical</p>
<p class="calibre1">change of any kind is almost always seen as a dramatic turn for the worse. Five</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred  years  ago,  the  courtiers  gathered  around  the  duke  of  Burgundy</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have said that unfolding innovations that undermined feudalism were</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil. They thought the world was rapidly spiraling downhil  at the very time</p>
<p class="calibre1">that later historians saw an explosion of human potential in the Renaissance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise,  what  may  someday  be  seen  as  a  new  Renaissance  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective of the next mil ennium wil  look frightening to tired twentieth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a high probability that some who are o ended by the new ways, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as wel  as many who are disadvantaged by them, wil  react unpleasantly. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">nostalgia for compulsion wil  probably turn violent. Encounters with these</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  “Luddites”  wil   make  the  transition  to  radical  new  forms  of  social</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization at least a measure of bad news for everyone. Get ready to duck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  speed  of  change  outracing  the  moral  and  economic  capacity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  in  living  generations  to  adapt,  you  can  expect  to  see  a  erce  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">indignant  resistance  to  the  Information  Revolution,  notwithstanding  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">great promise to liberate the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  must  understand  and  prepare  for  such  unpleasantness.  A  series  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition  crises  lies  ahead.  De ationary  tribulations,  such  as  the  Asian</p>
<p class="calibre1">contagion  that  swept  through  the  Far  East  to  Russia  and  other  emerging</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies in 1997 and 1998, wil  erupt sporadical y as the dated national and</p>
<p class="calibre1">international institutions left over from the Industrial Era prove inadequate</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  chal enges  of  the  new,  dispersed,  transnational  economy.  The  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  and  communication  technologies  are  more  subversive  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern state than any political threat to its predominance since Columbus</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailed.  This  is  important  because  those  in  power  have  seldom  reacted</p>
<p class="calibre1">peaceful y  to  developments  that  undermined  their  authority.  They  are  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely to now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The clash between the new and the old wil  shape the early years of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new mil ennium. We expect it to be a time of great danger and great reward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and a time of much diminished civility in some realms and unprecedented</p>

<p class="calibre1">expect  to  see  a  radical  restructuring  of  the  nature  of  sovereignty  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtual  death  of  politics  before  the  transition  is  over.  Instead  of  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">domination and control of resources, you are destined to see the privatization</p>
<p class="calibre1">of almost al  services governments now provide. For inescapable reasons that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we explore in this book, information technology wil  destroy the capacity of</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Sovereignty Through Markets</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To an extent that few would have imagined only a decade ago, individuals wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve  increasing  autonomy  over  territorial  nation-states  through  market</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanisms. Al  nation-states face bankruptcy and the rapid erosion of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority. Mighty as they are, the power they retain is the power to obliterate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  to  command.  Their  intercontinental  missiles  and  aircraft  carriers  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">already artifacts, as imposing and useless as the last warhorse of feudalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information technology makes possible a dramatic extension of markets</p>
<p class="calibre1">by altering the way that assets are created and protected. This is revolutionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, it promises to be more revolutionary for industrial society than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">advent of gunpowder proved to be for feudal agriculture. The transformation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the year 2000 implies the commercialization of sovereignty and the death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  politics,  no  less  than  guns  implied  the  demise  of  oath-based  feudalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Citizenship wil  go the way of chivalry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that the age of individual economic sovereignty is coming. Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  steel  mil s,  telephone  companies,  mines,  and  railways  that  were  once</p>
<p class="calibre1">“nationalized” have been rapidly privatized throughout the world, you wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon see the ultimate form of privatization&mdash;the sweeping denationalization</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the individual. The Sovereign Individual of the new mil ennium wil  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be an asset of the state, a  <i class="calibre4">de facto</i> item on the treasury’s balance sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">26</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-369"></a>After the transition of the year 2000, denationalized citizens wil  no longer be</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens as we know them, but customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BANDWIDTH TRUMPS BORDERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The commercialization of sovereignty wil  make the terms and conditions of</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship  in  the  nation-state  as  dated  as  chivalric  oaths  seemed  after  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse of feudalism. Instead of relating to a powerful state as citizens to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxed, the Sovereign Individuals of the twenty- rst century wil  be customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of governments operating from a “new logical space.” They wil  bargain for</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever minimal government they need and pay for it according to contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The governments of the Information Age wil  be organized along di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">principles than those which the world has come to expect over the past several</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries. Some jurisdictions and sovereignty services wil  be formed through</p>
<p class="calibre1">“assortive  matching,”  a  system  by  which  a nities,  including  commercial</p>
<p class="calibre1">a nities, are the basis upon which virtual jurisdictions earn al egiance. In rare</p>
<p class="calibre1">cases, the new sovereignties may be holdovers of medieval organizations, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  900-year-old  Sovereign  Military  Hospital er  Order  of  St.  John  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. More commonly known as the Knights</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Malta, the order is an a nity group for rich Catholics, with 10,000 current</p>
<p class="calibre1">members  and  an  annual  income  of  several  bil ions.  The  Knights  of  Malta</p>
<p class="calibre1">issues its own passports, stamps, and money, and carries on ful  diplomatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">relations  with  seventy  countries.  As  we  write  it  is  negotiating  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Republic  of  Malta  to  reassume  possession  of  Fort  St.  Angelo.  Taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">possession  of  the  castle  would  give  the  Knights  the  missing  ingredient  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">territoriality that wil  enable it to be recognized as a sovereignty. The Knights</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Malta  could  once  again  become  a  sovereign  microstate,  instantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">legitimized by a long history. It was from Fort St. Angelo that the Knights of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malta turned back the Turks in the Great Siege of 1565. Indeed, they ruled</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malta  for  many  years  thereafter,  until  they  were  expel ed  by  Napoleon  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1798. If the Knights of Malta were to return in the next few years, there could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be no clearer evidence that the modern nation-state system, ushered in after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  French  Revolution,  was  merely  an  interlude  in  the  longer  sweep  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history in which it has been the norm for many kinds of sovereignties to exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">27</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-384"></a>Stil  another and very di erent model for a postmodern sovereignty based</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  assortive  matching  is  the  Iridium  satel ite  telephone  network.  At  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">glance, you may think it odd to treat a cel ular telephone service as a kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty.  Yet  Iridium  has  already  received  recognition  as  a  virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty by international authorities. As you may know, Iridium is a global</p>
<p class="calibre1">cel ular  phone  service  that  al ows  subscribers  to  receive  cal s  on  a  single</p>
<p class="calibre1">number,  wherever  they  nd  themselves  on  the  planet,  from  Featherston, </p>
<p class="calibre1">New Zealand, to the Bolivian Chaco. To al ow cal s to be routed to Iridium</p>
<p class="calibre1">subscribers anywhere on the globe, given the architecture of global telecoms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">international telecom authorities had to agree to recognize Iridium as a virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">country, with its own country code: 8816. It is a short step logical y from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtual country comprising satel ite telephone subscribers to sovereignty for</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  coherent  virtual  communities  on  the  World  Wide  Web  that  span</p>
<p class="calibre1">borders. Bandwidth, or the carrying capacity of a communications medium, </p>
<p class="calibre1">has been expanding faster than computational capacity multiplied after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invention of transistors. If this trend to greater bandwidth continues, as we</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe  likely,  it  is  only  a  matter  of  a  few  years,  soon  after  the  turn  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium,  until  bandwidth  becomes  su ciently  capacious  to  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">technical y  possible  the  “metaverse,”  the  alternative,  cyberspace  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined  by  the  science  ction  novelist  Neal  Stephenson.  Stephenson’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">“metaverse” is a dense virtual community with its own laws. We believe it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitable that, as the cybereconomy becomes richer, its participants wil  seek</p>
<p class="calibre1">and obtain exemption from the anachronistic laws of nation-states. The new</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercommunities  wil   be  at  least  as  wealthy  and  competent  at  advancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  interests  as  the  Sovereign  Military  Hospital er  Order  of  St.  John  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jerusalem,  of  Rhodes  and  of  Malta.  Indeed,  they  wil   be  more  capable  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">asserting  themselves  because  of  far-reaching  communications  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">information warfare capabilities. We explore stil  other models of fragmented</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty in which smal  groups can e ectively lease the sovereignty of weak</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states, and operate their own economic havens much as free ports and</p>
<p class="calibre1">free trade zones are licensed to do today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  new  moral  vocabulary  wil   be  required  to  describe  the  relations  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign Individuals with one another and what remains of government. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspect  that  as  the  terms  of  these  new  relations  come  into  focus,  they  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">o end  many  people  who  came  of  age  as  “citizens”  of  twentieth-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">28</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-447"></a>nation-states.  The  end  of  nations  and  the  “denationalization  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual” wil  de ate some warmly held notions, such as “equal protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the law,” that presuppose power relations that are soon to be obsolete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As virtual communities gain coherence, they wil  insist that their members be</p>
<p class="calibre1">held accountable according to their own laws, rather than those of the former</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states  in  which  they  happen  to  reside.  Multiple  systems  of  law  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">again  coexist  over  the  same  geographic  area,  as  they  did  in  ancient  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as attempts to preserve the power of knights in armor were doomed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fail in the face of gunpowder weapons, so the modern notions of nationalism</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  citizenship  are  destined  to  be  short-circuited  by  microtechnology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, they wil  eventual y become comic in much the way that the sacred</p>
<p class="calibre1">principles  of  fteenth-century  feudalism  fel   to  ridicule  in  the  sixteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century. The cherished civic notions of the twentieth century wil  be comic</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronisms to new generations after the transformation of the year 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Don  Quixote  of  the  twenty- rst  century  wil   not  be  a  knight-errant</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggling to revive the glories of feudalism but a bureaucrat in a brown suit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a tax col ector yearning for a citizen to audit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">REVIVING LAWS OF THE MARCH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  seldom  think  of  governments  as  competitive  entities,  except  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadest sense, so the modern intuition about the range and possibilities of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  has  atrophied.  In  the  past,  when  the  power  equation  made  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">more di cult for groups to assert a stable monopoly of coercion, power was</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequently  fragmented,  jurisdictions  overlapped,  and  entities  of  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent  kinds  exercised  one  or  more  of  the  attributes  of  sovereignty.  Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">infrequently,  the  nominal  overlord  actual y  enjoyed  scant  power  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground.  Governments  weaker  than  the  nation-states  are  now  faced  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustained competition in their ability to impose a monopoly of coercion over</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  local  territory.  This  competition  gave  rise  to  adaptations  in  control ing</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence and attracting al egiance that wil  soon be new again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  reach  of  lords  and  kings  was  weak,  and  the  claims  of  one  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  groups  overlapped  at  a  frontier,  it  frequently  happened  that  neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  decisively  dominate  the  other.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  there  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">29</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-378"></a>numerous frontier or “march” regions where sovereignties blended together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These violent frontiers persisted for decades or even centuries in the border</p>
<p class="calibre1">areas  of  Europe.  There  were  marches  between  areas  of  Celtic  and  English</p>
<p class="calibre1">control in Ireland; between Wales and England, Scotland and England, Italy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  France,  France  and  Spain,  Germany  and  the  Slav  frontiers  of  Central</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe,  and  between  the  Christian  kingdoms  of  Spain  and  the  Islamic</p>
<p class="calibre1">kingdom  of  Granada.  Such  march  regions  developed  distinct  institutional</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  legal  forms  of  a  kind  that  we  are  likely  to  see  again  in  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium.  Because  of  the  competitive  position  of  the  two  authorities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">residents of march regions seldom paid tax. What is more, they usual y had a</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice in deciding whose laws they were to obey, a choice that was exercised</p>
<p class="calibre1">through such legal concepts as “avowal” and “distraint” that have now al  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished. We expect such concepts to become a prominent feature of the law</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Information Societies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Transcending Nationality</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the nation-state, it was di cult to enumerate precisely the number of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignties  that  existed  in  the  world  because  they  overlapped  in  complex</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways and many varied forms of organization exercised power. They wil  do so</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.  The  dividing  lines  between  territories  tended  to  become  clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">demarcated and  xed as borders in the nation-state system. They wil  become</p>
<p class="calibre1">hazy again in the Information Age. In the new mil ennium, sovereignty wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be fragmented once more. New entities wil  emerge exercising some but not</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  of the characteristics we have come to associate with governments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these new entities, like the Knights Templar and other religious</p>
<p class="calibre1">military  orders  of  the  Middle  Ages,  may  control  considerable  wealth  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">military power without control ing any  xed territory. They wil  be organized</p>
<p class="calibre1">on principles that bear no relation to nationality at al . Members and leaders</p>
<p class="calibre1">of religious corporations that exercised sovereign authority in parts of Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Middle Ages in no sense derived their authority from national identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were of al  ethnic backgrounds and professed to owe their al egiance to</p>
<p class="calibre1">God, and not to any a nities that members of a nationality are supposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">share in common. </p>
<p class="calibre1">30</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-41"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Merchant Republics of Cyberspace</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">You wil  also see the re-emergence of associations of merchants and wealthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals  with  semisovereign  powers,  like  the  Hanse  (confederation  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchants) in the Middle Ages. The Hanse that operated in the French and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flemish  fairs  grew  to  encompass  the  merchants  of  sixty  cities. <a href="#calibre_link-1">10</a>  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hanseatic  League,”  as  it  is  redundantly  known  in  English  (the  literal</p>
<p class="calibre1">translation  is  “Leaguely  League”),  was  an  organization  of  Germanic</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchant guilds that provided protection to members and negotiated trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">treaties. It came to exercise semisovereign powers in a number of Northern</p>
<p class="calibre1">European and Baltic cities. Such entities wil  re-emerge in place of the dying</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state  in  the  new  mil ennium,  providing  protection  and  helping  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">enforce contracts in an unsafe world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, the future is likely to confound the expectations of those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have absorbed the civic myths of twentieth-century industrial society. Among</p>
<p class="calibre1">them are the il usions of social democracy that once thril ed and motivated</p>
<p class="calibre1">the most gifted minds. They presuppose that societies evolve in whatever way</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  wish  them  to&mdash;preferably  in  response  to  opinion  pol s  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrupulously counted votes. This was never as true as it seemed  fty years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it is an anachronism, as much an artifact of industrialism as a rusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">smokestack.  The  civic  myths  re ect  not  only  a  mindset  that  sees  society’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems  as  susceptible  to  engineering  solutions;  they  also  re ect  a  false</p>
<p class="calibre1">con dence  that  resources  and  individuals  wil   remain  as  vulnerable  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">political compulsion in the future as they have been in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We doubt it. Market forces, not political majorities, wil  compel societies to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recon gure themselves in ways that public opinion wil  neither comprehend</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor welcome. As they do, the naïve view that history is what people wish it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be wil  prove wildly misleading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  wil   therefore  be  crucial  that  you  see  the  world  anew.  That  means</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking from the outside in to reanalyze much that you have probably taken</p>

<p class="calibre1">To prepare yourself for the world that is coming you must understand why it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   be  di erent  from  what  most  experts  tel   you.  That  involves  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely at the hidden causes of change. We have attempted to do this with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unorthodox  analysis  we  cal   the  study  of  megapolitics.  In  two  previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">volumes,  <i class="calibre4">Blood  in  the  Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i>,  we  argued  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most important causes of change are not to be found in political manifestos</p>
<p class="calibre1">or in the pronouncements of dead economists, but in the hidden factors that</p>
<p class="calibre1">alter  the  boundaries  where  power  is  exercised.  Often,  subtle  changes  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">climate,  topography,  microbes,  and  technology  alter  the  logic  of  violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  transform  the  way  people  organize  their  livelihoods  and  defend</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notice that our approach to understanding how the world changes is very</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent from that of most forecasters. We are not experts  <i class="calibre4">in</i> anything, in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense that we pretend to know a great deal more about certain “subjects” than</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  who  have  spent  their  entire  careers  cultivating  highly  specialized</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge.  To  the  contrary,  we  look  from  the  outside  in.  We  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledgeable  <i class="calibre4">around</i> the subjects about which we make forecasts. Most of</p>
<p class="calibre1">al , this involves seeing where the boundaries of necessity are drawn. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they change, society necessarily changes, no matter what people may wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the contrary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  our  view,  the  key  to  understanding  how  societies  evolve  is  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand  factors  that  determine  the  costs  and  rewards  of  employing</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence.  Every  human  society,  from  the  hunting  band  to  the  empire,  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  informed  by  the  interactions  of  megapolitical  factors  that  set  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevailing  version  of  the  “laws  of  nature.”  Life  is  always  and  everywhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex.  The  lamb  and  the  lion  keep  a  delicate  balance,  interacting  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">margin. If lions were suddenly more swift, they would catch prey that now</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape.  If  lambs  suddenly  grew  wings,  lions  would  starve.  The  capacity  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">32</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-43"></a>utilize and defend against violence is the crucial variable that alters life at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">margin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  put  violence  at  the  center  of  our  theory  of  megapolitics  for  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason. The control of violence is the most important dilemma every society</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces. As we wrote in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason that people resort to violence is that it often pays. In some ways, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simplest thing a man can do if he wants money is to take it. That is no less true</p>
<p class="calibre1">for an army of men seizing an oil  eld than it is for a single thug taking a wal et. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Power,  as  Wil iam  Playfair  wrote,  “has  always  sought  the  readiest  road  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth, by attacking those who were in possession of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  chal enge  to  prosperity  is  precisely  that  predatory  violence  does  pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel  in some circumstances. War does change things. It changes the rules. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes the distribution of assets and income. It even determines who lives and</p>
<p class="calibre1">who dies. It is precisely the fact that violence does pay that makes it hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">control. <a href="#calibre_link-1">12</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking in these terms has helped us foresee a number of developments</p>
<p class="calibre1">that better-informed experts insisted could never happen. For example,  <i class="calibre4">Blood</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">in  the  Streets, </i>  published  in  early  1987,  was  our  attempt  to  survey  the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">stages of the great megapolitical revolution now under way. We argued then</p>
<p class="calibre1">that technological change was destabilizing the power equation in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among our principal points:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We said that American predominance was in decline, which would lead to</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  imbalances  and  distress,  including  another  1929-style  stock</p>
<p class="calibre1">market crash. Experts were al  but unanimous in denying that such a thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  happen.  Yet  within  six  months,  in  October  1987,  world  markets</p>
<p class="calibre1">were convulsed by the most violent sel -o  of the century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  told  readers  to  expect  the  col apse  of  Communism.  Again,  experts</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughed. Yet 1989 brought the events that “no one could have predicted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Berlin Wal  fel , as revolutions swept away Communist regimes from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Baltic to Bucharest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  explained  why  the  multiethnic  empire  the  Bolshevik  nomenklatura</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherited  from  the  tsars  would  “inevitably  crack  apart.”  At  the  end  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">December  1991,  the  hammer-and-sickle  banner  was  lowered  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kremlin for the last time as the Soviet Union ceased to exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">33</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-335"></a>During the height of the Reagan arms buildup, we argued that the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood at the threshold of sweeping disarmament. This, too, was considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlikely,  if  not  preposterous.  Yet  the  fol owing  seven  years  brought  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most sweeping disarmament since the close of World War I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At a time when experts in North America and Europe were pointing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan  for  support  of  the  view  that  governments  can  successful y  rig</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets, we said otherwise. We forecast that the Japanese  nancial assets</p>
<p class="calibre1">boom  would  end  in  a  bust  Soon  after  the  fal   of  the  Berlin  Wal ,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Japanese stock market crashed, losing almost half its value. We continue to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe that its ultimate low could match or exceed the 89 percent loss that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wal  Street su ered at the bottom after 1929. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  a  point  when  almost  everyone,  from  the  middle-class  family  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world’s  largest  real  estate  investors,  appeared  to  believe  that  property</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets could only rise and not fal , we warned that a real estate bust was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the o ng. Within four years, real estate investors throughout the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost more than $1 tril ion as property values dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Long  before  it  was  obvious  to  the  experts,  we  explained  in   <i class="calibre4">Blood in the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Streets</i>  that  the  income  of  blue-col ar  workers,  had  decreased  and  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined  to  continue  fal ing  on  a  long-term  basis.  As  we  write  today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost a decade later, it has at last begun to dawn on a sleepy world that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is true. Average hourly wages in the United States have fal en below</p>
<p class="calibre1">those achieved in the second Eisenhower administration. In 1993, average</p>
<p class="calibre1">annualized hourly wages in constant dol ars were $18,808. In 1957, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eisenhower  was  sworn  in  for  his  second  term,  U.S.  annualized  average</p>
<p class="calibre1">hourly wages were $18,903. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  main  themes  of   <i class="calibre4">Blood  in  the  Streets</i>  have  proven  remarkably</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurate  with  the  bene t  of  hindsight,  only  a  few  years  ago  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  rank  nonsense  by  the  guardians  of  conventional  thinking.  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">reviewer  in   <i class="calibre4">Newsweek</i>  in  1987  re ected  the  closed  mental  climate  of  late</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial society when he dismissed our analysis as “an unthinking attack on</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  might  imagine  that   <i class="calibre4">Newsweek</i>  and  similar  publications  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized  with  the  passage  of  time  that  our  line  of  analysis  had  revealed</p>
<p class="calibre1">something useful about the way the world was changing. Not a bit. The  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">edition of  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i> was greeted with the same sniggering hostility</p>
<p class="calibre1">34</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-301"></a>that welcomed  <i class="calibre4">Blood in the Streets. </i> No less an authority than the  <i class="calibre4">Wall Street</i> <i class="calibre4">Journal</i> categorical y dismissed our analysis as the nattering of “your dopey</p>
<p class="calibre1">aunt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  chuckling  aside,  the  themes  of   <i class="calibre4">The  Great  Reckoning</i>  proved  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">ludicrous than the guardians of orthodoxy pretended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We extended our forecast of the death of the Soviet Union, exploring why</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia  and  the  other  former  Soviet  republics  faced  a  future  of  growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">civil disorder, hyperin ation, and fal ing living standards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We explained why the 1990s would be a decade of downsizing, including</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  rst  time  a  worldwide  downsizing  of  governments  as  wel   as</p>
<p class="calibre1">business entities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  also  forecast  that  there  would  be  a  major  rede nition  of  terms  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">income redistribution, with sharp cutbacks in the level of bene ts. Hints</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  scal crisis appeared from Canada to Sweden, and American politicians</p>
<p class="calibre1">began to talk of “ending welfare as we know it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We anticipated and explained why the “new world order” would prove to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a “new world disorder.” Wel  before the atrocities in Bosnia engrossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the headlines, we warned that Yugoslavia would col apse into civil war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Somalia slid into anarchy, we explained why the pending col apse of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments in Africa would lead some countries there to be e ectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed into receivership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We forecast and explained why militant Islam would displace Marxism as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the principal ideology of confrontation with the West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Years  before  the  Oklahoma  bombing  and  the  attempt  to  blow  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">World Trade Center, we explained why the United States faced an upsurge</p>
<p class="calibre1">in terrorism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  headlines  that  told  of  the  rioting  that  swept  Los  Angeles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toronto,  and  other  cities,  we  explained  why  the  emergence  of  criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">subcultures among urban minorities was setting the stage for widespread</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We also anticipated “the  nal depression of the twentieth century,” which</p>
<p class="calibre1">began  in  Asia  in  1989  and  has  been  spreading  back  from  the  periphery</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  the  center  of  the  global  system.  We  said  that  the  Japanese  stock</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  would  fol ow  Wal   Street’s  path  after  1929,  and  that  this  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead  to  credit  col apse  and  depression.  Although  massive  government</p>
<p class="calibre1">35</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-342"></a>intervention in Japan and elsewhere temporarily prevented markets from</p>
<p class="calibre1">ful y re ecting the deterioration of credit conditions, this only displaced</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  compounded  economic  distress,  building  pressures  for  competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">devaluations  and  a  systemic  credit  col apse  of  the  kind  that  imploded</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies worldwide in the 1930s. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i> also spel ed out a number of controversial theses that</p>
<p class="calibre1">have not yet been con rmed, or have not reached the level of development</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we forecast:</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  said  that  the  Japanese  stock  market  would  fol ow  Wal   Street’s  path</p>
<p class="calibre1">after  1929,  and  that  this  would  lead  to  credit  col apse  and  depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  unemployment  rates  in  Spain,  Finland,  and  a  few  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  exceeded  those  of  the  1930s,  and  a  number  of  countries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including Japan, did experience local depressions, there has not yet been a</p>
<p class="calibre1">systemic credit col apse of the kind that imploded economies worldwide</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the 1930s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We argued that the breakdown of the command-and-control system in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">former Soviet Union would lead to the spread of nuclear weapons into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands  of  ministates,  terrorists,  and  criminal  gangs.  To  the  world’s  good</p>
<p class="calibre1">fortune, this has not come to pass, at least not to the degree that we feared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Press reports indicate that Iran purchased several tactical nuclear weapons</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the black market; more worryingly, the  <i class="calibre4">Times</i> of London reported on</p>
<p class="calibre1">October  7,  1998,  that  “Osama  bin  Laden,  the  exiled  mil ionaire  Saudi</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrorist  leader,  has  acquired  tactical  nuclear  weapons  from  the  former</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soviet Central Asian states, according to a leading Arab newspaper.” That</p>
<p class="calibre1">said, there has been no o cial y con rmed deployment or use of nuclear</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons from the arsenals of the former Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  explained  why  the  “War  on  Drugs”  was  a  recipe  for  subverting  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">police  and  judicial  systems  of  countries  where  drug  use  is  widespread, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly the United States. With tens of bil ions of dol ars in hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly pro ts piling up each year, drug dealers have the means as wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  incentive  to  corrupt  even  apparently  stable  countries.  While  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  media  have  carried  occasional  stories  hinting  at  high-level</p>
<p class="calibre1">penetration of the U.S. political system by drug money, the ful  story has</p>
<p class="calibre1">not yet been told. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-385"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Looking Where Others Don’t</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  points  where  our  forecasts  were  mistaken  or  seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistaken in light of what is now known, the record stands to scrutiny. Much</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  what  is  likely  to  gure  in  future  economic  histories  of  the  1990s  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">forecast or anticipated and explained in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning. </i> Many of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">predictions  were  not  simple  extrapolations  or  extensions  of  trends,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">forecasts  of  major  departures  from  what  has  been  considered  normal  since</p>
<p class="calibre1">World  War  II.  We  warned  that  the  1990s  would  be  dramatical y  di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the previous  ve decades. Reading the news of 1991 through 1998, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">see that the themes of  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i> were borne out almost daily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We see these developments not as examples of isolated di culties, trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">here, trouble there, but as shocks and tremors that run along the same fault</p>
<p class="calibre1">line. The old order is being toppled by a megapolitical earthquake that wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolutionize institutions and alter the way thinking people see the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In spite of the central role of violence in determining the way the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">works, it attracts surprisingly little serious attention. Most political analysts</p>
<p class="calibre1">and economists write as if violence were a minor irritant, like a  y buzzing</p>
<p class="calibre1">around a cake, and not the chef who baked it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Another Megapolitical Pioneer</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  there  has  been  so  little  clear  thinking  about  the  role  of  violence  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">history  that  a  bibliography  of  megapolitical  analysis  could  be  written  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single sheet of paper. In  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i> we drew upon and elaborated</p>
<p class="calibre1">arguments  of  an  almost  entirely  forgotten  classic  of  megapolitical  analysis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wil iam Playfair’s  <i class="calibre4">An Enquiry into the Permanent Causes of the Decline and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fall of Powerful and Wealthy Nations, </i> published in 1805. Here one of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">departure  points  is  the  work  of  Frederic  C.  Lane.  Lane  was  a  medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">historian  who  wrote  several  penetrating  essays  on  the  role  of  violence  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">history during the 1940s and 1950s. Perhaps the most comprehensive of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  “Economic  Consequences  of  Organized  Violence,”  which  appeared  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  <i class="calibre4">Journal of Economic History</i> in 1958. Few people other than professional</p>
<p class="calibre1">economists and historians have read it, and most of them seem not to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized its signi cance. Like Playfair, Lane wrote for an audience that did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not yet exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">37</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Insights for the Information Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane published his work on violence and the economic meaning of war wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">before the advent of the Information Age. He certainly was not writing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipation of microprocessing or the other technological revolutions now</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolding.  Yet  his  insights  into  violence  established  a  framework  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding  how  society  wil   be  recon gured  in  the  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  window  Lane  opened  into  the  future  was  one  through  which  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">peered into the past. He was a medieval historian, and particularly a historian</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a trading city, Venice, whose fortunes surged and sagged in a violent world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  thinking  about  how  Venice  rose  and  fel ,  his  attention  was  attracted  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">issues  that  can  help  you  understand  the  future.  He  saw  the  fact  that  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence is organized and control ed plays a large role in determining “what</p>
<p class="calibre1">uses are made of scarce resources.” <a href="#calibre_link-1">13</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  Lane’s  analyses  of  the  competitive  uses  of  violence  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">much to tel  us about how life is likely to change in the Information Age. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t  expect  most  people  to  notice,  much  less  fol ow,  so  unfashionably</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract  an  argument.  While  the  attention  of  the  world  is  riveted  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">dishonest  debates  and  wayward  personalities,  the  meanderings  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitics  continue  almost  unnoted.  The  average  North  American  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably lavished one hundred times more attention on O. J. Simpson and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica Lewinsky than he has on the new microtechnologies that are poised</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  antiquate  his  job  and  subvert  the  political  system  he  depends  on  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">unemployment compensation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE VANITY OF WISHES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The tendency to overlook what is fundamental y important is not con ned</p>
<p class="calibre1">solely to the couch dwel er watching television. Conventional thinkers of al</p>
<p class="calibre1">shapes and sizes observe one of the pretenses of the democratic nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;that  the  views  people  hold  determine  the  way  the  world  changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently  sophisticated  analysts  lapse  into  explanations  and  forecasts  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">interpret  major  historical  developments  as  if  they  were  determined  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishful  way.  A  striking  example  of  this  type  of  reasoning  appeared  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">38</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-45"></a>editorial  page  of  the   <i class="calibre4">New  York  Times</i>  just  as  we  were  writing:  “Goodbye, Nation-State, Hel o… What?,” by Nicholas Colchester. <a href="#calibre_link-1">14 </a>Not only was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">topic, the death of the nation-state, the very topic we are addressing, but its</p>
<p class="calibre1">author presents himself as an excel ent marker to il ustrate how far removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">our way of thinking is from the norm. Colchester is no simpleton. He wrote</p>
<p class="calibre1">as editorial director of the  <i class="calibre4">Economist</i> Intel igence Unit. If anyone should form</p>
<p class="calibre1">a realistic view of the world it should be he. Yet his article clearly indicates in</p>
<p class="calibre1">several places that “the coming of international government” is “now logical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">unstoppable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why?  Because  the  nation-state  is  faltering  and  can  no  longer  control</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In our view, this assumption verges on the absurd. To suppose that some</p>
<p class="calibre1">speci c  new  form  of  governance  wil   emerge  simply  because  another  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed is a fal acy. By that reasoning, Haiti and the Congo would long ago have</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  better  government  simply  because  what  they  had  was  so  luminously</p>
<p class="calibre1">inadequate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colchester’s point of view, widely shared among the few who think about</p>
<p class="calibre1">such things in North America and Europe, utterly fails to take into account</p>
<p class="calibre1">the larger megapolitical forces that determine what types of political systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">are actual y viable. That is the focus of this book. When the technologies that</p>
<p class="calibre1">are shaping the new mil ennium are considered, it is far more likely that we</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  see not one world government, but microgovernment, or even conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching anarchy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For every serious analysis of the role of violence in determining the rules</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  which  everyone  operates,  dozens  of  books  have  been  written  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intricacies  of  wheat  subsidies,  and  hundreds  more  about  arcane  aspects  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">monetary policy. Much of this shortfal  in thinking about the crucial issues</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  actual y  determine  the  course  of  history  probably  re ects  the  relative</p>
<p class="calibre1">stability of the power con guration over the past several centuries. The bird</p>
<p class="calibre1">that fal s asleep on the back of a hippopotamus does not think about losing</p>
<p class="calibre1">its perch until the hippo actual y moves. Dreams, myths, and fantasies play a</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  larger  role  in  informing  the  supposed  social  sciences  than  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is particularly evident in the abundant literature of economic justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mil ions of words have been uttered and written about economic justice and</p>
<p class="calibre1">39</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-474"></a>injustice  for  each  page  devoted  to  careful  analysis  of  how  violence  shapes society, and thus sets the boundaries within which economies must function. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet formulations of economic justice in the modern context presuppose that</p>
<p class="calibre1">society is dominated by an instrument of compulsion so powerful that it can</p>
<p class="calibre1">take away and redistribute life’s good things. Such power has existed for only</p>
<p class="calibre1">a few generations of the modern period. Now it is fading away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Big Brother on Social Security</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial technology gave governments greater instruments of control in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century  than  ever  before.  For  a  time,  it  seemed  inevitable  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments would become so e ective at monopolizing violence as to leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">little  room  for  individual  autonomy.  Nobody  at  mid-century  was  looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward to the triumph of the Sovereign Individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  of  the  shrewdest  observers  of  the  mid-twentieth  century  became</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced on the evidence of the day that the tendency of the nation-state to</p>
<p class="calibre1">centralize power would lead to totalitarian domination over al  aspects of life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  George  Orwel ’s   <i class="calibre4">1984</i>  (1949),  Big  Brother  was  watching  the  individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">vainly  struggle  to  maintain  a  margin  of  autonomy  and  self-respect.  It</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared to be a losing cause. Friedrich von Hayek’s  <i class="calibre4">The  Road  to  Serfdom</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(1944) took a more scholarly view in arguing that freedom was being lost to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new form of economic control that left the state as the master of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These works were written before the advent of microprocessing, which has</p>
<p class="calibre1">incubated a whole range of technologies that enhance the capacity of smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups and even individuals to function independently of central authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  shrewd  as  observers  like  Hayek  and  Orwel   were,  they  were  unduly</p>
<p class="calibre1">pessimistic.  History  has  unfolded  its  surprises.  Totalitarian  Communism</p>
<p class="calibre1">barely outlasted the year 1984. A new form of serfdom may yet emerge in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next mil ennium if governments succeed in suppressing the liberating aspects</p>
<p class="calibre1">of microtechnology. But it is far more likely that we wil  see unprecedented</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  and  autonomy  for  the  individual.  What  our  parents  worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">about may prove to be no problem at al . What they took for granted as  xed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  permanent  features  of  social  life  now  seem  destined  to  disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever  necessity  sets  boundaries  to  human  choice,  we  adjust,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reorganize our lives accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">40</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-46"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Hazards of Forecasting</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">No doubt we put our smal  measure of dignity at risk in attempting to foresee</p>
<p class="calibre1">and explain profound changes in the organization of life and the culture that</p>
<p class="calibre1">binds  it  together.  Most  forecasts  are  doomed  to  make  sil y  reading  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ful ness of time. And the more dramatic the change they envision, the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">embarrassingly  wrong  they  tend  to  be.  The  world  doesn’t  end.  The  ozone</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t  vanish.  The  coming  Ice  Age  dissolves  into  global  warming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding al  the alarms to the contrary, there is stil  oil in the tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.  Antrobus,  the  everyman  of   <i class="calibre4">The  Skin  of  Our  Teeth, </i>  avoids  freezing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">survives wars and threatened economic calamities, and grows old ignoring the</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied alarms of experts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  attempts  to  “unveil”  the  future  soon  turn  out  to  be  comic.  Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  self-interest  provides  a  strong  incentive  to  clear  thinking,  forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision  is  often  myopic.  In  1903,  the  Mercedes  company  said  that  “there</p>
<p class="calibre1">would never be as many as 1 mil ion automobiles worldwide. The reason was</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it was implausible that as many as 1 mil ion artisans worldwide would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">trainable as chau eurs. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Recognizing this should stop our mouths. It doesn’t. We are not afraid to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand in line for a due share of ridicule. If we mistake matters greatly, future</p>
<p class="calibre1">generations  may  laugh  as  heartily  as  they  please,  presuming  anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembers what we said. To dare a thought is to risk being wrong. We are</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardly  so  sti   and  useless  that  we  are  afraid  to  err.  Far  from  it.  We  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather venture thoughts that might prove useful to you than suppress them</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  of  apprehension  that  they  might  prove  overblown  or  embarrassing  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrospect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Arthur  C.  Clarke  shrewdly  noted,  the  two  overriding  reasons  why</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts  to  anticipate  the  future  usual y  fal   at  are  “Failure  of  Nerve  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure of Imagination. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”16 </a>Of the two, he wrote, “Failure of Nerve seems to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  the  more  common;  it  occurs  when   <i class="calibre4">even  given  all  the  relevant  facts</i>  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">would-be prophet cannot see that they point to an inescapable conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these failures are so ludicrous as to be almost unbelievable.” <a href="#calibre_link-3">17</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Where  our  exploration  of  the  Information  Revolution  fal s  short,  as  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably wil , the cause wil  be due more to a lack of imagination than to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lack of nerve. Forecasting the future has always been a bold enterprise, one</p>
<p class="calibre1">41</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-343"></a>which  properly  excites  skepticism.  Perhaps  time  wil   prove  that  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">deductions are wildly o  the mark. Unlike Nostradamus, we do not pretend</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be prophetic personalities. We do not foretel  the future by stirring a wand</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a bowl of water or by casting horoscopes. Nor do we write in cryptic verse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our purpose is to provide you with a sober, detached analysis of issues that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could prove to be of great importance to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We feel an obligation to set out our views, even where they seem heretical, </p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  because  they  may  not  otherwise  be  heard.  In  the  closed  mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmosphere  of  late  industrial  society,  ideas  do  not  tra c  as  freely  as  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">should through the established media. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is written in a constructive spirit. It is the third we have written</p>
<p class="calibre1">together, analyzing various stages of the great change now under way. Like</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Blood  in  the  Streets</i>  and   <i class="calibre4">The  Great  Reckoning, </i>  it  is  a  thought  exercise.  It explores the death of industrial society and its recon guration in new forms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We expect to see amazing paradoxes in the years to come. On the one hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you  wil   witness  the  realization  of  a  new  form  of  freedom,  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergence  of  the  Sovereign  Individual.  You  can  expect  to  see  almost  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete liberation of productivity. At the same time, we expect to see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">death  of  the  modern  nation-state.  Many  of  the  assurances  of  equality  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Western people have grown to take for granted in the twentieth century are</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined to die with it. We expect that representative democracy as it is now</p>
<p class="calibre1">known wil  fade away, to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybermarketplace.  If  our  deductions  are  correct,  the  politics  of  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">century wil  be much more varied and less important than that to which we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have become accustomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  are  con dent  that  our  argument  wil   be  easy  to  fol ow, </p>

<p class="calibre1">For  centuries,  the  end  of  this  mil ennium  has  been  seen  as  a  pregnant</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment in history. More than 850 years ago, St. Malachy  xed 2000 as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">date of the Last Judgment. American psychic Edgar Cayce said in 1934 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the earth would shift on its axis in the year 2000, causing California to split in</p>
<p class="calibre1">two and inundating New York City and Japan. A Japanese rocket scientist, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hideo  Itokawa,  announced  in  1980  that  the  alignment  of  the  planets  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grand Cross” on August 18, 1999, would cause widespread environmental</p>
<p class="calibre1">devastation, leading to the end of human life on earth. <a href="#calibre_link-3">18</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Such visions of apocalypse make a plump target for ridicule. After al , the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year  2000,  while  an  imposing  round  number,  would  appear  to  be  only  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">arbitrary  artifact  of  the  Christian  calendar  as  adopted  in  the  West.  Other</p>
<p class="calibre1">calendars and dating systems calculate centuries and mil ennia from di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting  points.  By  the  reckoning  of  the  Islamic  calendar,  for  example,  A.D. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2000 wil  be the year 1378. As ordinary-sounding as a year can be. According</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the Chinese calendar, which repeats itself every sixty years, A.D. 2000 is just</p>
<p class="calibre1">another  year  of  the  dragon.  It  is  part  of  a  continuous  cycle  that  extends</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennia into the past. Yet there is more than theological investment in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year 2000. Its importance is undergirded not only by Christian tradition, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the limitations of mid-century information technology. The so-cal ed Y2K</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  year  2000  computer  problem,  a  potential y  devastating  logic  aw  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">bil ions of lines of computer code, could approximate apocalyptic conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  closing  down  essential  elements  of  industrial  society  on  the  mil ennial</p>
<p class="calibre1">midnight. Many computers and microprocessors use software preserved and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recycled  from  the  earliest  days  of  computers,  when  memory  space,  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">$600,000  per  megabyte,  was  more  valuable  than  gold.  To  save  expensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">space, the early programmers tracked dates with only the last two numbers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the year. This convention of employing two-digit date  elds was carried over</p>
<p class="calibre1">43</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-48"></a>into most software employed in mainframe computers, and even found wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  in  personal  computers  and  so-cal ed  embedded  chips,  microprocessors</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  are  used  to  control  almost  everything,  from  VCRs  to  car  ignition</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems, security systems, telephones, the switching systems that control the</p>
<p class="calibre1">telephone network, process and control systems in factories, power plants, oil</p>
<p class="calibre1">re neries, chemical plants, pipelines and much more. Thus, abbreviated into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a two-digit  eld, the year 1999 would be “99.” The trouble is what happens</p>
<p class="calibre1">when 00 comes up for the year 2000. Many computers wil  read this as 1900. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This may make it impossible for many unremediated computers and other</p>
<p class="calibre1">digital devices to recognize the year 2000 in date  elds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result wil  be a massive problem of data corruption that wil  provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">an accidental il ustration of a new potential for information warfare. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  potential  adversaries  wil   be  able  to  wreak  havoc  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">detonating “logic bombs” that sabotage the functions of essential systems by</p>
<p class="calibre1">corrupting  the  data  upon  which  their  functioning  depends.  As  a  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise, for example, you would not need to shoot down an airplane, if you</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  corrupt  data  crucial  to  its  safe  operation.  Data  corruption  can  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost as much as physical weapons can to thwart the function of a modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">society.  That  this  has  potential y  far-reaching  consequences  should  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious  on  re ection.  For  example,  the   <i class="calibre4">Mail</i>  of  London  reported  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">December 14, 1997, that airlines around the globe were planning to cancel</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds  of  ights  on  January  1,  2000  out  of  fear  that  air  tra c  control</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems  could  fail<a href="#calibre_link-3">.19</a>  Potential  problems  include  not  only  the  air  tra c systems, but also date-sensitive functions built into the airplanes themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Boeing,  many  airplanes  wil   require  Y2K  remediation.  Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices may have a problem if they try to log an event on an invalid date. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">y-by-wire  computer-control ed  systems  that  operate  airplanes  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">malfunction  if  they  are  programmed  to  conclude  that  crucial  maintenance</p>
<p class="calibre1">was last performed in the year 1900. They many even go into an error loop</p>
<p class="calibre1">and shut down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  potential y  lethal  feedback  e ects  of  a  logic  time  bomb  that  closes</p>

<p class="calibre1">a memorable date for unpleasant reasons. Remember, you can be a ected by</p>
<p class="calibre1">many devices that go into an error loop and shut down even if you are lucky</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough not to  nd yourself in midair when the new mil ennium begins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">44</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-416"></a>You  would  be  wel   advised  to  avoid  an  accident  arising  from  non-Y2K-</p>
<p class="calibre1">compliant pacemakers, or simply inebriated mil ennial revelers, because if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pacemakers shut down, the phone system might also, so the ambulance might</p>
<p class="calibre1">never come. Unless you live in Brazil or Ukraine, you are used to picking up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the telephone or turning on the car phone and automatical y getting a dial</p>
<p class="calibre1">tone. Happily, you seldom have to concern yourself with the technical details</p>
<p class="calibre1">of how the telephone system operates. But it turns out that phone network</p>
<p class="calibre1">switches and routers are highly date dependent. Al  connections are logged to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a date and time, which is crucial to calculating cal  duration for bil ing. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen to make a one-minute cal  at 11:59:30 on December 31, 1999, and at</p>
<p class="calibre1">12:00:00 the system reads your cal  as having had a negative duration of more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  99  years,  error  loops  and  shutdown  are  possible.  While  long-distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">companies are spending great sums to upgrade their switches to make them</p>
<p class="calibre1">year 2000 compliant, and local service providers presumably are too, if even a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few smal er companies fail to comply and go down, the whole network could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a ected. You wil  be lucky to get a dial tone on January 1, 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the words of the Y2K expert Peter de Jager, “If we lose the ability to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make a phone cal , then we lose everything. We lose electronic fund transfers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we lose trading, we lose branch banking.” And the fol ow-on consequences of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Y2K failures could come to more than that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, no one knows how pervasively crucial systems wil  crash because of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the year 2000 problem. Embedded systems that cannot be reprogrammed but</p>
<p class="calibre1">must be replaced if nonfunctional on a date-sensitive basis are found in cars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trucks, and buses built after 1976. (Perhaps you won’t be in an accident with</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles  driven  by  persons  with  noncompliant  pacemakers,  because  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles might not start.) Embedded systems are also widespread in al  types</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  power  plants,  water  and  sewage  systems,  medical  devices,  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment,  aircraft,  o shore  oil  platforms,  oil  tankers,  alarm  systems,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">elevators.  While  many  assemblies  of  microprocessors  perform  no  date-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensitive functions, they may nonetheless depend upon a clock, which may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be Y2K sensitive, for their internal operations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">45</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-475"></a>The  large-scale  command  and  control  systems  of  government  and  major</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations that involve high transaction volumes on mainframe computers</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  the  original  focus  of  Y2K  concern.  Because  they  operate  on  big</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines for which most software is decades old and mostly noncompliant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  original  alarms  about  Y2K,  rst  sounded  by  Peter  de  Jager  early  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1990s, have focused mainly on the need to upgrade operating systems for big, </p>
<p class="calibre1">multiprocessing  mainframes.  Mr.  de  Jager  voiced  concern  that  there  might</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  be  enough  programmers  conversant  with  COBOL,  the  old  mainframe</p>
<p class="calibre1">language, to complete the necessary patches and repairs to date-sensitive code, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even if every company and government agency with a vulnerable system had</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun  a  crash  program  several  years  ago.  Since  this  has  not  happened,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">many operators of date-sensitive information systems have only just begun to</p>
<p class="calibre1">assess  their  vulnerability,  you  can  predict  with  a  high  degree  of  con dence</p>
<p class="calibre1">that many mainframe systems wil  not be prepared to operate smoothly into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the year 2000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is certainly a major concern because there is real y no alternative to</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer processing as the economy is now structured. Most businesses that</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  large  enough  to  require  a  mainframe  to  handle  their  transactions  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">dependent upon transaction volumes that could not be managed with old-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashioned  nineteenth-century  paperwork  systems.  If  such  businesses  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced  to  revert  to  shu ing  paper  they  could  expect  to  complete  only  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraction of their normal transaction volume. The revenue shock from such a</p>
<p class="calibre1">drop-o  in business would endanger the survival of al  but the most highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalized companies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost everything related to money&mdash;invoicing, purchasing, and payrol</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems,  plus  inventory  controls  and  regulatory  compliance&mdash;would  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">fouled up. Huge quantities of data would be lost as computers crash or spew</p>

<p class="calibre1">Also  high  on  your  list  of  concerns  should  be  what  happens  if  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">electricity goes o  because of Y2K-related malfunctions. Without electricity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  most  systems  that  are  not  Y2K-impaired  wil   not  function:  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">refrigerator, your freezer, perhaps even your source of heat. Y2K compliance</p>
<p class="calibre1">issues could e ect safety-related access and control functions at nuclear power</p>
<p class="calibre1">plants.  For  example,  personnel  at  nuclear  facilities  wear  dosimetry  devices</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  measure  the  amount  of  radiation  exposure  they  receive  while  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plant.  These  devices  are  analyzed  regularly,  with  the  data  on  exposure</p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts maintained on a computer system that controls personnel access to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the facility. Obviously, if the control ing computers fail, they wil  make a hash</p>
<p class="calibre1">of al  the elaborate controls designed to insure safe operation and guarantee</p>
<p class="calibre1">proper  maintenance.  But,  more  importantly,  a  Nuclear  Regulatory</p>
<p class="calibre1">Commission  memo  notes  that  many  “non-safety-related,  but  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer-based systems, primarily databases and data col ection necessary for</p>
<p class="calibre1">plant operations,” are date sensitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  conventional  generating  plants  are  not  less  vulnerable  to  Y2K</p>
<p class="calibre1">disruption. For one thing, coal-powered plants are susceptible to disruptions</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the surface transportation system that brings the coal to the boilers. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1997-1998  winter  heating  season,  operators  of  coal- red  electricity</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation  found  themselves  forced  to  reduce  output  in  some  instances</p>
<p class="calibre1">because  of  a  slowdown  in  rail  deliveries  of  Western  coal  arising  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">merger  of  the  Southern  Paci c  and  Union  Paci c  railway  systems.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem  arose  because  of  incompatibilities  between  the  computer  control</p>
<p class="calibre1">and dispatch systems employed by the two railroads. According to a Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">47</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-370"></a>Paci c  spokesman,  integrating  the  two  systems  became  a  “nightmare,”  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">spite  of  the  fact  that  Union  Paci c  Technologies  has  been  considered  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">industry leader in developing computerized transportation control systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  result  of  the  programming  di culties,  the  railroad  was  unable  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurately  track  the  movements  of  its  freight  cars.  The  failure  of  Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paci c  to  master  the  assimilation  of  Southern  Paci c  is  a  bad  omen  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  could  happen  when  Y2K  logic  time  bombs  disrupt  transportation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">power generation, and other aspects of the economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  biggest  worry  about  the  electric  grid,  however,  arises  from  the  fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  whole  system  is  subject  to  sensitive  monitoring  and  computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">control to transfer electricity from areas of surplus generation to those with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">de cit.  This  process  must  be  careful y  monitored  by  computer  to  prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">power surges and system failures. Al  the transfers of electricity are logged to</p>
<p class="calibre1">time and date for duration, much like a telephone connection. While heavy-</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty mechanical relays are used to make the connections, they are control ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by computer systems. These computer controls, essential for load balancing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">may fail for the same reasons as the phone networks. In fact, the power load</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution-control  systems  in  North  America  are  networked  together</p>
<p class="calibre1">through T-1 lines and telephone microwave links. So if the phone network</p>
<p class="calibre1">fails, you can expect the electricity to go down as wel . And remember, as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience  in  Canada  in  January  1998  con rms,  once  the  electricity  shuts</p>
<p class="calibre1">down  over  a  wide  area,  getting  the  system  running  again  is  a  chal enge.  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">blackout may last for an inconveniently long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Y2K AND THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For modern economies to have the electricity turn o  in the dead of winter</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be disruptive and potential y health threatening, especial y for those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who depend upon electric heat and medical equipment. Yet the worst case</p>
<p class="calibre1">scenario  is  even  worse.  According  to  John  Koskinen,  who  heads  President</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton’s  Y2K  Conversion  Council,  U.S.  military  arsenals  may  cease  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">function  on  the  stroke  of  midnight,  December  31,  1999.  While  indicating</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he does not wish to touch o  undue alarm, Koskinen adds, “It needs to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be worried about.” One concern about nuclear missiles “is if the data doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">function and they actual y go o .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">48</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-49"></a>Of course, this concern would apply with equal or greater force to Russian</p>
<p class="calibre1">nuclear missiles. Russia’s bankruptcy has made upgrades for Y2K compliance</p>
<p class="calibre1">even more problematic than in the United States. And there is evidence that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia is not yet taking Y2K conversion seriously. While one would pray that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  accidental  launches  would  occur,  there  should  be  little  doubt  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn of the year 2000 has a potential for aggravating global insecurity if for no</p>
<p class="calibre1">other reason than that military communications systems in many countries</p>
<p class="calibre1">may  not  function  normal y.  As  Koskinen  puts  it,  “If  you’re  sitting  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">country and suddenly you can’t quite  gure out exactly what’s happening, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and your communications don’t work as wel , you get even more nervous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  put  that  on  your  list  of  Y2K  worries.  The  logic  time  bomb  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitate the launch of genuinely explosive bombs&mdash;a fact that highlights</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  danger  from  information  warfare  to  centralized  command  and  control</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If terrorists wish to strike any centralized system, they may pick December</p>
<p class="calibre1">31,  1999,  as  the  date  for  action  because  it  wil   be  a  time  of  maximum</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerability of many systems. Not only wil  communications be strained at</p>
<p class="calibre1">best,  with  the  possibility  that  electricity  may  fail,  vehicles  may  not  start, </p>
<p class="calibre1">police,  re, and ambulance 911 service may not work, and so on, but many</p>
<p class="calibre1">other functions you probably take for granted, such as air tra c control, may</p>
<p class="calibre1">cease to function. No power means no water from the tap. Sewage systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  fail.  Tra c  lights  could  turn  o .  Within  a  few  hours  of  a  genuine</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakdown  in  the  transportation  system,  food  in  grocery  stores  would  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">shopped  out.  (Or  looted.)  On  the  basis  of  recent  experience  in  American</p>
<p class="calibre1">cities, you could suppose that no power, no water, no heat for many, no light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and fragmented communications with emergency services, including police</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  re,  al   add  up  to  no  civilization.  While  no  one  can  be  sure  what  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impact of the Y2K problem may be, it could extend to looting and rioting in</p>

<p class="calibre1">mil ennial  tradition  of  Joachim  de  Fiore  whose  mediations  convinced  him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  Christ  was  only  “the  second  hinge  of  history”  and  that  another  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined  to  unfold. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”21  </a>So  argues  the  philosopher  Michael  Grosso,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggests that the Information Revolution is piloting human history toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  realization  of  the  prophetic  vision  of  the  Western  world.  He  cal s  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">“technocalypse.” Whether or not the development of technology is somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">informed  by  mil ennial  visions,  the  Y2K  phenomenon  is  an  artifact  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominant  Western  imagination  of  time.  In  a  strange  way,  it  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">complement  dreams,  reveries  and  visions,  or  numerical  interpretations  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">visions, like Newton’s gloss on the prophecies of Daniel. These intuitive leaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin with a perspective that takes the birth of Christ to be the central fact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history.  They  are  compounded  by  the  psychological  power  of  large  round</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers, which every trader wil  recognize as having an arresting quality. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">two thousandth year of our epoch cannot help but become a focus for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination of intuitive people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  critic  could  easily  make  these  premonitions  seem  sil y,  without  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">addressing  the  ambiguous  and  debatable  theological  notions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apocalypse and the Last Judgment that give these visions so much of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">power. Interestingly, however, the Y2K computer glitch trumps the errors of</p>
<p class="calibre1">arithmetic that otherwise might seem to devalue the importance of the year</p>
<p class="calibre1">2000 even within the Christian framework. The year 2000 has the potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">to become an in ection point for the next stage of history simply because it</p>
<p class="calibre1">brings  forward  the  arrival  of  the  new  mil ennium.  In  strict  logic,  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium wil  not begin until 2001. The year 2000 wil  be only the last year</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the twentieth century, the two thousandth year since Christ’s birth. Or it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be had Christ been born in the  rst year of the Christian era. He was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. In 533, when Christ’s birth replaced the founding date of Rome as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">basis for calculating years according to the Western calendar, the monks who</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced  the  new  convention  miscalculated  Christ’s  birth.  It  is  now</p>
<p class="calibre1">accepted that he was born in 4 B.C. On that basis, a ful  two thousand years</p>
<p class="calibre1">since  his  birth  were  completed  sometime  in  1997.  Hence  Carl  Jung’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently odd launch date for the start of a New Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">50</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-345"></a>Giggle  if  you  wil ,  but  we  do  not  despise  or  dismiss  intuitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">understandings of history. Although our argument is grounded in logic, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  reveries,  we  are  awed  by  the  prophetic  power  of  human  consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time after time, it redeems the visions of madmen, psychics, and saints. So it</p>
<p class="calibre1">may be with the transformation of the year 2000. The date that has long been</p>
<p class="calibre1">xed in the imagination of the West looks to be the in ection point that at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least  half  con rms  that  history  has  a  destiny.  We  cannot  explain  why  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be, but nonetheless we are convinced that it is so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our  intuition  is  that  history  has  a  destiny,  and  that  free  wil   and</p>
<p class="calibre1">determinism  are  two  versions  of  the  same  phenomenon.  The  human</p>
<p class="calibre1">interactions that form history behave as though they were informed by a kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of destiny. Just as an electron plasma, a dense gas of electrons, behaves as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex system, so do human beings. The freedom of individual movement</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the electrons turns out to be compatible with highly organized col ective</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior.  As  David  Bohm  said  of  an  electron  plasma,  human  history  is  “a</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly organized system which behaves as a whole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding  the  way  the  world  works  means  developing  a  realistic</p>
<p class="calibre1">intuition  of  the  way  that  human  society  obeys  the  mathematics  of  natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes.  Reality  is  nonlinear.  But  most  people’s  expectations  are  not.  To</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand  the  dynamics  of  change,  you  have  to  recognize  that  human</p>
<p class="calibre1">society, like other complex systems in nature, is characterized by cycles and</p>
<p class="calibre1">discontinuities.  That  means  certain  features  of  history  have  a  tendency  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeat themselves, and the most important changes, when they occur, may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">abrupt rather than gradual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the cycles that permeate human life, a mysterious  ve-hundred-</p>
<p class="calibre1">year  cycle  appears  to  mark  major  turning  points  in  the  history  of  Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization. As the year 2000 approaches, we are haunted by the strange fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the  nal decade of each century divisible by  ve has marked a profound</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition in Western civilization, a pattern of death and rebirth that marks</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  phases  of  social  organization  in  much  the  way  that  death  and  birth</p>
<p class="calibre1">delineate the cycle of human generations. This has been true since at least 500</p>
<p class="calibre1">B.C.,  when  Greek  democracy  emerged  with  the  constitutional  reforms  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cleisthenes in 508 B.C. The fol owing  ve centuries were a period of growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and intensi cation of the ancient economy, culminating in the birth of Christ</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  4  B.C.  This  was  also  the  time  of  the  greatest  prosperity  of  the  ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">51</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-51"></a>economy, when interest rates reached their lowest level prior to the modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next  ve centuries saw a gradual winding down of prosperity, leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the col apse of the Roman Empire late in the  fth century A.D. Wil iam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Playfair’s summary is worth repeating: “When Rome was at its highest pitch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  greatness  …  wil   be  seen  to  be  at  the  birth  of  Christ,  that  is,  during  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reign  of  Augustus,  and  by  the  same  means  it  wil   be  found  declining</p>
<p class="calibre1">gradual y til  the year 490.” <a href="#calibre_link-3">22</a> It was then that the last legions dissolved, and the Western world sank into the Dark Ages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the fol owing  ve centuries, the economy withered, long-distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade  ground  to  a  halt,  cities  were  depopulated,  money  vanished  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">circulation,  and  art  and  literacy  almost  disappeared.  The  disappearance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective law with the col apse of the Roman Empire in the West led to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergence of more primitive arrangements for settling disputes. The blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">feud began to be signi cant at the end of the  fth century. The  rst recorded</p>
<p class="calibre1">incident of trial by ordeal occurred precisely in the year 500. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, a thousand years ago, the  nal decade of the tenth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnessed  another  “tremendous  upheaval  in  social  and  economic  systems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the least known of these transitions, the feudal revolution, began at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">time of utter economic and political turmoil. In  <i class="calibre4">The Transformation of the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Year  One  Thousand, </i>  Guy  Bois,  a  professor  of  medieval  history  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">University of Paris, claims that this rupture at the end of the tenth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved the complete col apse of the remnants of ancient institutions, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  emergence  of  something  new  out  of  the  anarchy&mdash;feudalism. <a href="#calibre_link-3">23</a>  In  the words of Raoul Glaber, “It was said that the whole world, with one accord, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shook o  the tatters of antiquity. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”24 </a>The new system that suddenly emerged</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodated the slow revival of economic growth. The  ve centuries now</p>
<p class="calibre1">known as the Middle Ages saw a rebirth of money and international trade, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along with the rediscovery of arithmetic, literacy, and time awareness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, in the  nal decade of the  fteenth century, there was yet another</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning point. It was then that Europe emerged from the demographic de cit</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused by the Black Death and almost immediately began to assert dominion</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the rest of the globe. The “Gunpowder Revolution,” the “Renaissance,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the “Reformation” are names given to di erent aspects of this transition</p>
<p class="calibre1">that ushered in the Modern Age. It was announced with a bang when Charles</p>
<p class="calibre1">52</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-52"></a>VIII invaded Italy with new bronze cannon. It involved an opening to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, epitomized by Columbus sailing to America in 1492. This opening to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the New World launched a push toward the most dramatic economic growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  experience  of  humanity.  It  involved  a  transformation  of  physics  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">astronomy  that  led  to  the  creation  of  modern  science.  And  its  ideas  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">disseminated widely with the new technology of the printing press. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  we  sit  at  the  threshold  of  another  mil ennial  transformation.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  command  and  control  systems  inherited  from  the  Industrial  Era  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">break down like the one-horse shay on the stroke of the mil ennial midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet whether or not the Y2K logic bomb precipitates an immediate col apse of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  society,  its  days  are  numbered.  We  expect  the  advent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Society to utterly transform the world, in ways that this book is</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant to explain. You would be perfectly within your rights to doubt this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">since no cycle that repeats itself only twice in a mil ennium has demonstrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough  iterations  to  be  statistical y  signi cant.  Indeed,  even  much  shorter</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycles  have  been  viewed  skeptical y  by  economists  demanding  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">statistical y  satisfying  proof.  “Professor  Dennis  Robertson  once  wrote  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we had better wait a few centuries before being sure” about the existence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">four-year  and  eight-  to  ten-year  trade  cycles. <a href="#calibre_link-3">25  </a>By  that  standard,  Professor Robertson would have to suspend judgment for about thirty thousand years</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be sure that the  ve-hundred-year cycle is not a statistical  uke. We are less</p>
<p class="calibre1">dogmatic, or more wil ing to take a hint. We recognize that the patterns of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality  are  more  complex  than  the  static-  and  linear-equilibrium  models  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">most economists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  the  coming  of  the  year  2000  marks  more  than  another</p>
<p class="calibre1">convenient division along an endless continuum of time. We believe it wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">an in ection point between the Old World and a New World to come. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial Age is rapidly passing, and its demise may, ironical y, be accelerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the fact that early computer memory was so expensive that it encouraged</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  widespread  adoption  of  two-digit  date  elds.  When  Hal erith  punch</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards  could  accommodate  only  eighty  characters  each,  abbreviating  dates</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  a  prudent  thing  to  do.  Contrary  to  the  expectations  of  the  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmers,  however,  their  abbreviation  of  the  date  eld  endured  four</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades  until  the  end  of  the  mil ennium  as  an  accidental  logic  bomb  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could destroy a large part of Industrial society. The U.S. government’s O ce</p>
<p class="calibre1">53</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-2"></a>of  Management  and  Budget  described  the  problem  in  “Getting  Federal</p>
<p class="calibre1">Computers  Ready  for  2000,”  a  report  dated  February  7,  1997.  The  OMB</p>
<p class="calibre1">concludes of computers: “Unless they are  xed or replaced, they wil  fail at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the turn of the century in one of three ways: they wil  reject legitimate entries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or they wil  compute erroneous results, or they simply wil  not run.” These</p>
<p class="calibre1">three  outcomes  in  combination  could  cripple  Industrial  society.  Its</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology of mass production is destined to be eclipsed by a new technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">of miniaturization in any event. A near-term crisis wil  merely accelerate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">process.  With  the  new  information  technology  has  come  a  new  science  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonlinear  dynamics,  one  whose  startling  conclusions  are  mere  strands  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">have yet to be woven together into a comprehensive worldview. We live in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  of  the  computer,  but  our  dreams  are  stil   spun  on  the  loom.  We</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue to live by the metaphors and thoughts of industrialism. We don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet  imagine  the  world  in  terms  of  strange  attractors.  Our  politics  stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">straddles the industrial divide between right and left, as mapped by thinkers</p>
<p class="calibre1">like Adam Smith and Karl Marx, who died before almost everyone now living</p>
<p class="calibre1">was born. <a href="#calibre_link-2">II </a>The industrial worldview, incorporating the operating principles</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  industrial  science,  is  stil   the  “commonsense”  intuition  of  educated</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion. It is our thesis that the “common sense” of the Industrial Age wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">no longer apply to many areas as the world is transformed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than eighty- ve years after the day in 1911 when Oswald Spengler</p>
<p class="calibre1">was seized with an intuition of a coming world war and “the decline of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">West,”  we,  too,  see   <i class="calibre4">“a  historical  change  of  phase</i>  occurring…  at  the  point</p>
<p class="calibre1">preordained  for  it  hundreds  of  years  ago.” <a href="#calibre_link-3">26  </a>Like  Spengler,  we  see  the impending death of Western civilization, and with it the col apse of the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">order that has predominated these past  ve centuries, ever since Columbus</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailed west to open contact with the New World. Yet unlike Spengler we see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the birth of a new stage in Western civilization in the coming mil ennium. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE WANING OF THE MODERN WORLD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In our view, you are witnessing nothing less than the waning of the Modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age. It is a development driven by a ruthless but hidden logic. More than we</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly understand, more than CNN and the newspapers tel  us, the next</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium wil  no longer be “modern.” We say this not to imply that you</p>
<p class="calibre1">face a savage or backward future, although that is possible, but to emphasize</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the stage of history now opening wil  be qualitatively di erent from that</p>
<p class="calibre1">into which you were born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something new is coming. Just as farming societies di ered in kind from</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunting-and-gathering bands, and industrial societies di ered radical y from</p>
<p class="calibre1">feudal or yeoman agricultural systems, so the New World to come wil  mark a</p>
<p class="calibre1">radical departure from anything seen before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  mil ennium,  economic  and  political  life  wil   no  longer  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized on a gigantic scale under the domination of the nation-state as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  during  the  modern  centuries.  The  civilization  that  brought  you  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">war, the assembly line, social security, income tax, deodorant, and the toaster</p>
<p class="calibre1">oven is dying. Deodorant and the toaster oven may survive. The others won’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  an  ancient  and  once  mighty  man,  the  nation-state  has  a  future</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbered in years and days, and no longer in centuries and decades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">55</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-54"></a>Governments  have  already  lost  much  of  their  power  to  regulate  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">compel. The col apse of Communism marked the end of a long cycle of  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  during  which  magnitude  of  power  overwhelmed  e ciency  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization of government. It was a time when the returns to violence were</p>
<p class="calibre1">high  and  rising.  They  no  longer  are.  A  phase  transition  of  world-historic</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimensions has already begun. Indeed, the future Gibbon who chronicles the</p>
<p class="calibre1">decline and fal  of the once-Modern Age in the next mil ennium may declare</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it had already ended by the time you read this book. Looking back, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">may say, as we do, that it ended with the fal  of the Berlin Wal  in 1989. Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the death of the Soviet Union in 1991. Either date could come to stand</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a de ning event in the evolution of civilization, the end of what we now</p>
<p class="calibre1">know as the Modern Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fourth stage of human development is coming, and perhaps its least</p>
<p class="calibre1">predictable  feature  is  the  new  name  under  which  it  wil   be  known.  Cal   it</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Post-Modern.”  Cal   it  the  “Cyber  Society”  or  the  “Information  Age.”  Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">make up your own name. No one knows what conceptual glue wil  stick a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nickname to the next phase of history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  do  not  even  know  that  the  ve-hundred-year  stretch  of  history  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">ending wil  continue to be thought of as “modern.” If future historians know</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything  about  word  derivations,  it  wil   not  be.  A  more  descriptive  title</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be “The Age of the State” or “The Age of Violence.” But such a name</p>
<p class="calibre1">would fal  outside the temporal spectrum that currently de nes the epochs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history.  “Modern,”  according  to  the   <i class="calibre4">Oxford  English  Dictionary, </i>  means</p>
<p class="calibre1">“pertaining to the present and recent times, as distinguished from the remote</p>

<p class="calibre1">Western  people  consciously  thought  of  themselves  as  “modern”  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  they  came  to  understand  that  the  medieval  period  was  over.  Before</p>
<p class="calibre1">1500, no one had ever thought of the feudal centuries as a “middle” period in</p>

<p class="calibre1">reasonably  be  seen  as  sandwiched  in  the  “middle”  of  two  other  historic</p>
<p class="calibre1">epochs, it must have already come to an end. Those living during the feudal</p>

<p class="calibre1">To see “outside” an existing system is like being a stagehand trying to force a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">the system functioning. Every social order incorporates among its key taboos</p>
<p class="calibre1">the notion that people living in it should not think about how it wil  end and</p>

<p class="calibre1">convention  that  rules  the  world.  Every  social  system,  however  strongly  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakly  it  clings  to  power,  pretends  that  its  rules  wil   never  be  superseded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  are  the  last  word.  Or  perhaps  the  only  word.  Primitives  assume  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">theirs  is  the  only  possible  way  of  organizing  life.  More  economical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">complicated  systems  that  incorporate  a  sense  of  history  usual y  place</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves at its apex. Whether they are Chinese mandarins in the court of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the emperor, the Marxist nomenklatura in Stalin’s Kremlin, or members of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  House  of  Representatives  in  Washington,  the  powers-that-be  either</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine no history at al  or place themselves at the pinnacle of history, in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">superior position compared to everyone who came before, and the vanguard</p>
<p class="calibre1">of anything to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is true for practical reasons. The more apparent it is that a system is</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearing an end, the more reluctant people wil  be to adhere to its laws. Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">57</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-349"></a>social  organization  wil   therefore  tend  to  discourage  or  play  down  analyses that  anticipate  its  demise.  This  alone  helps  ensure  that  history’s  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">transitions  are  seldom  spotted  as  they  happen.  If  you  know  nothing  else</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the future, you can rest assured that dramatic changes wil  be neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcomed nor advertised by conventional thinkers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You cannot depend upon conventional information sources to give you an</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective and timely warning about how the world is changing and why. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you wish to understand the great transition now under way, you have little</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice but to  gure it out for yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Beyond the Obvious</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  means  looking  beyond  the  obvious.  The  record  shows  that  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">transitions that are undeniably real in retrospect may not be acknowledged</p>
<p class="calibre1">for decades or even centuries after they happen. Consider the fal  of Rome. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  probably  the  most  important  historic  development  in  the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium  of  the  Christian  era.  Yet  long  after  Rome’s  demise,  the  ction</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it survived was held out to public view, like Lenin’s embalmed corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one who depended upon the pretenses of o cials for his understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the “news” would have learned that Rome had fal en until long after that</p>
<p class="calibre1">information ceased to matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reason  was  not  merely  the  inadequacy  of  communications  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancient  world.  The  outcome  would  have  been  much  the  same  had  CNN</p>
<p class="calibre1">miraculously been in business, running its videotape in September 476. That</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  when  the  last  Roman  emperor  in  the  West,  Romulus  Augustulus,  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">captured in Ravenna and forcibly retired to a vil a in Campania on a pension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  if  Wolfe  Blitzer  had  been  there  with  minicams  recording  the  news  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">476,  it  is  unlikely  that  he  or  anyone  else  would  have  dared  to  characterize</p>
<p class="calibre1">those events as marking the end of the Roman Empire. That, of course, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly what latter historians said happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CNN editors probably would not have approved a headline story saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rome fel  this evening.” The powers-that-be denied that Rome had fal en. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peddlers of “news” seldom are partisans of controversy in ways that would</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermine  their  own  pro ts.  They  may  be  partisan.  They  may  even  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">outrageously  so.  But  they  seldom  report  conclusions  that  would  convince</p>
<p class="calibre1">58</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-56"></a>subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and head for the hil s. Which is why</p>
<p class="calibre1">few would have reported the fal  of Rome even if it had been technological y</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible. Experts would have come forth to say that it was ridiculous to speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Rome  fal ing.  To  have  said  otherwise  would  have  been  bad  for  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, perhaps, bad for the health of those doing the reporting. The powers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">late- fth-century  Rome  were  barbarians,  and  they  denied  that  Rome  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal en. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was not merely a case of authorities’ saying, “Don’t report this or we</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  kil  you.” Part of the problem was that Rome was already so degenerate</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the later decades of the  fth century that its “fal ” genuinely eluded the</p>
<p class="calibre1">notice of most people who lived through it. In fact, it was a generation later</p>
<p class="calibre1">before Count Marcel inus  rst suggested that “The Western Roman Empire</p>
<p class="calibre1">perished  with  this  Augustulus.” <a href="#calibre_link-3">4  </a>Many  more  decades  passed,  perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries,  before  there  was  a  common  acknowledgment  that  the  Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire in the West no longer existed. Certainly Charlemagne believed that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a legitimate Roman emperor in the year 800. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The point is not that Charlemagne and al  who thought in conventional</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms about the Roman Empire after 476 were fools. To the contrary. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">characterization of social developments is frequently ambiguous. When the</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of predominant institutions is brought into the bargain to reinforce a</p>
<p class="calibre1">convenient conclusion, even one based largely on pretense, only someone of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong character and strong opinions would dare contradict it. If you try to</p>
<p class="calibre1">put yourself in the position of a Roman of the late  fth century, it is easy to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine  how  tempting  it  would  have  been  to  conclude  that  nothing  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed.  That  certainly  was  the  optimistic  conclusion.  To  have  thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise  might  have  been  frightening.  And  why  come  to  a  frightening</p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusion when a reassuring one was at hand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  al ,  a  case  could  have  been  made  that  business  would  continue  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual.  It  had  in  the  past.  The  Roman  army,  and  particularly  the  frontier</p>
<p class="calibre1">garrisons,  had  been  barbarized  for  centuries<a href="#calibre_link-3">.5  </a>By  the  third  century,  it  had become  regular  practice  for  the  army  to  proclaim  a  new  emperor.  By  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourth  century,  even  o cers  were  Germanized  and  frequently  il iterate<a href="#calibre_link-3">.6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There  had  been  many  violent  overthrows  of  emperors  before  Romulus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustulus was removed from the throne. His departure might have seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  di erent  to  his  contemporaries  than  many  other  upheavals  in  a  chaotic</p>
<p class="calibre1">59</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-57"></a>time. And he was sent packing with a pension. The very fact that he received a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pension, even for a brief period before he was murdered, was a reassurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the system survived. To an optimist, Odoacer, who deposed Romulus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustulus,  reuni ed  rather  than  destroyed  the  empire.  A  son  of  Attila’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sidekick  Edecon,  Odoacer  was  a  clever  man.  He  did  not  proclaim  himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">emperor.  Instead,  he  convened  the  Senate  and  prevailed  upon  its  too-</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestible  members  that  they  o er  the  emperorship  and  thus  sovereignty</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the whole empire to Zeno, the Eastern emperor in faraway Byzantium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Odoacer was merely to be Zeno’s  <i class="calibre4">patricius</i> to govern Italy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Wil  Durant wrote in  <i class="calibre4">The Story of Civilization, </i> these changes did not</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear to be the “fal  of Rome” but merely “negligible shifts on the surface of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the national scene. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”7 </a>When Rome fel , Odoacer said that Rome endured. He, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along  with  almost  everyone  else,  was  keen  to  pretend  that  nothing  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed. They knew that “the glory that was Rome” was far better than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbarism that was taking its place. Even the barbarians thought so. As C. W. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Previte-Orton wrote in  <i class="calibre4">The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History, </i> the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  fth century, when “the Emperors had been replaced by barbaric German</p>
<p class="calibre1">kings,” was a time of “persistent make-believe.” <a href="#calibre_link-3">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Persistent Make-Believe” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This “make-believe” involved the preservation of the façade of the old system, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  as  its  essence  was  “deformed  by  barbarism. <a href="#calibre_link-3">”9</a>  The  old  forms  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  remained  the  same  when  the  last  emperor  was  replaced  by  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbarian “lieutenant.” The Senate stil  met. “The praetorian prefecture and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other high o ces continued, and were held by eminent Romans. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”10</a> Consuls</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  stil   nominated  for  a  year.  “The  Roman  civil  administration  survived</p>
<p class="calibre1">intact.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">11 </a>Indeed, in some ways it remained intact until the birth of feudalism at the end of the tenth century. On public occasions, the old imperial insignia</p>
<p class="calibre1">was stil  employed. Christianity was stil  the state religion. The barbarians stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretended to owe fealty to the Eastern emperor in Constantinople, and to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditions of Roman law. In fact, in Durant’s words, “in the West the great</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire was no more. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”12</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">So What? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">60</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-58"></a>The faraway example of the fal  of Rome is relevant for a number of reasons</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  you  contemplate  conditions  in  the  world  today.  Most  books  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future  are  real y  books  about  the  present.  We  have  sought  to  remedy  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">defect by making this book about the future  rst of al  a book about the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  think  that  you  are  likely  to  draw  a  better  perspective  about  what  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future has in store if we il ustrate important megapolitical points about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">logic  of  violence  with  real  examples  from  the  past.  History  is  an  amazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacher. The stories it has to tel  are more interesting than any we could make</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.  And  many  of  the  more  interesting  relate  to  the  fal   of  Rome.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">document  important  lessons  that  could  be  relevant  to  your  future  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  of  al ,  the  fal   of  Rome  is  one  of  history’s  more  vivid  examples  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what  happened  in  a  major  transition  when  the  scale  of  government  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apsing.  The  transitions  of  the  year  1000  also  involved  the  col apse  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">central authority, and did so in a way that increased the complexity and scope</p>
<p class="calibre1">of economic activity. The Gunpowder Revolution at the end of the  fteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  involved  major  changes  in  institutions  that  tended  to  raise  rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than shrink the scale of governance. Today, for the  rst time in a thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">years, megapolitical conditions in the West are undermining and destroying</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments,  corporate  conglomerates,  labor  unions,  and  many  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions that operate on a large scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the col apse in the scale of governance at the end of the Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire had very di erent causes from those prevailing now, at the advent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age. Part of the reason that Rome fel  is simply that it had</p>
<p class="calibre1">expanded  beyond  the  scale  at  which  the  economies  of  violence  could  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained. The cost of garrisoning the empire’s far- ung borders exceeded</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  economic  advantages  that  an  ancient  agricultural  economy  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">support.  The  burden  of  taxation  and  regulation  required  to  nance  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">military  e ort  rose  to  exceed  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corruption  became  endemic.  A  large  part  of  the  e ort  of  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanders, as historian Ramsay MacMul en has documented, was devoted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  pursuit  of  “il icit  pro ts  of  their  command.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">13  </a>This  they  pursued  by shaking  down  the  population,  what  the  fourth-century  observer  Synesius</p>
<p class="calibre1">described as “the peace-time war, one almost worse than the barbarian war</p>
<p class="calibre1">and arising from the military’s indiscipline and the o cers’ greed.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">61</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-476"></a>Another  important  contributing  factor  to  Rome’s  col apse  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">demographic  de cit  caused  by  the  Antonine  plagues.  The  col apse  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roman  population  in  many  areas  obviously  contributed  to  economic  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">military weakness. Nothing of that kind has happened today, at least not yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a longer view, perhaps, the scourge of new “plagues” wil  compound</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  chal enges  of  technological  devolution  in  the  new  mil ennium.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">unprecedented bulge in human population in the twentieth century creates a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempting  target  for  rapidly  mutating  microparasites.  Fears  about  the  Ebola</p>
<p class="calibre1">virus, or something like it, invading metropolitan populations may be wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">founded. But this is not the place to consider the coevolution of humans and</p>
<p class="calibre1">diseases. As interesting a topic as that is, our argument at this juncture is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">about why Rome fel , or even about whether the world today is vulnerable to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some of the same in uences that contributed to Roman decline. It is about</p>
<p class="calibre1">something di erent&mdash;namely, the way that history’s great transformations are</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceived, or rather, misperceived as they happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People  are  always  and  everywhere  to  some  degree  conservative,  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  “c.” That implies a reluctance to think in terms of dissolving venerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">social  conventions,  overturning  the  accepted  institutions,  and  defying  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">laws  and  values  from  which  they  drew  their  bearings.  Few  are  inclined  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine  that  apparently  minor  changes  in  climate  or  technology  or  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  variable  can  somehow  be  responsible  for  severing  connections  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  of  their  fathers.  The  Romans  were  reluctant  to  acknowledge  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes unfolding around them. So are we. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet recognize it or not, we are living through a change of historical season, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  transformation  in  the  way  people  organize  their  livelihoods  and  defend</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves that is so far-reaching that it wil  inevitably transform the whole of</p>
<p class="calibre1">society. The change wil  be so profound, in fact, that to understand it wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">require taking almost nothing for granted. You wil  be invited at almost every</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn  to  believe  that  the  coming  Information  Societies  wil   be  very  like  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial society you grew up in. We doubt it. Microprocessing wil  dissolve</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mortar in the bricks. It wil  so profoundly alter the logic of violence that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  inevitably change the way people organize their livelihoods and defend</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves.  Yet  the  tendency  wil   be  to  downplay  the  inevitability  of  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes,  or  to  argue  about  their  desirability  as  if  it  were  within  the  at  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial institutions to determine how history evolves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">62</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-59"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Grand Illusion</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Authors who are in many ways better informed than we are wil  nevertheless</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead  you  astray  in  thinking  about  the  future  because  they  are  far  too</p>
<p class="calibre1">super cial in examining how societies work. For example, David Kline and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel  Burstein  have  written  a  wel -researched  volume  entitled   <i class="calibre4">Road</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Warriors: Dreams and Nightmares Along the Information Highway. </i> It is ful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  admirable  detail,  but  much  of  this  detail  is  marshaled  in  arguing  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">il usion,  the  idea  “that  citizens  can  act  together,  consciously,  to  shape  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spontaneous  economic  and  natural  processes  going  on  around  them.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it may not be obvious, this is equivalent to saying that feudalism</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have survived if everyone had rededicated himself to chivalry. No one</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  court  of  the  late  fteenth  century  would  have  objected  to  such  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentiment. Indeed, it would have been heresy to do so. But it also would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been entirely misleading, an example of the snake trying to  t the future into</p>
<p class="calibre1">its old skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  basic  causes  of  change  are  precisely  those  that  are  not  subject  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious control. They are the factors that alter the conditions under which</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  pays.  Indeed,  they  are  so  remote  from  any  obvious  means  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulation  that  they  are  not  even  subjects  of  political  maneuvering  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  saturated  with  politics.  No  one  ever  marched  in  a  demonstration</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting, “Increase scale economies in the production process.” No banner</p>
<p class="calibre1">has ever demanded, “Invent a weapons system that increases the importance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the infantry.” No candidate ever promised to “alter the balance between</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ciency and magnitude in protection against violence.” Such slogans would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be ridiculous, precisely because their goals are beyond the capacity of anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">to consciously a ect. Yet as we wil  explore, these variables determine how the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world works to a far greater degree than any political platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  think  about  it  careful y,  it  should  be  obvious  that  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">transitions in history seldom are driven primarily by human wishes. They do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  happen  because  people  get  fed  up  with  one  way  of  life  and  suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">prefer another. A moment’s re ection suggests why. If what people think and</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire  were  the  only  determinants  of  what  happens,  then  al   the  abrupt</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes  in  history  would  have  to  be  explained  by  wild  mood  swings</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconnected to any change in the actual conditions of life. In fact, this never</p>
<p class="calibre1">63</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-308"></a>happens. Only in cases of medical problems a ecting a few people do we see</p>
<p class="calibre1">arbitrary  uctuations  in  mood  that  appear  entirely  divorced  from  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a rule, large numbers of people do not suddenly and al  at once decide</p>
<p class="calibre1">to abandon their way of life simply because they  nd it amusing to do so. No</p>
<p class="calibre1">forager ever said, “I am tired of living in prehistoric times, I would prefer the</p>
<p class="calibre1">life  of  a  peasant  in  a  farming  vil age.”  Any  decisive  swing  in  patterns  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior  and  values  is  invariably  a  response  to  an  actual  change  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  of  life.  In  this  sense,  at  least,  people  are  always  realistic.  If  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">views  do  change  abruptly,  it  probably  indicates  that  they  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">confronted  by  some  departure  from  familiar  conditions:  an  invasion,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">plague, a sudden climatic shift, or a technological revolution that alters their</p>
<p class="calibre1">livelihoods or their ability to defend themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far  from  being  the  product  of  human  desire,  decisive  historic  changes</p>
<p class="calibre1">more often than not confound the wish of most people for stability. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">change occurs, it typical y causes widespread disorientation, especial y among</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who lose income or social status. You wil  look in vain at public opinion</p>
<p class="calibre1">pol s or other measures of mood for an understanding of how the coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical transition is likely to unfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LIFE WITHOUT FORESIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  we  fail  to  perceive  the  great  transition  going  on  around  us,  it  is  partly</p>
<p class="calibre1">because we do not desire to see. Our foraging forebears may have been just as</p>
<p class="calibre1">obdurate, but they had a better excuse. No one ten thousand years ago could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have foreseen the consequences of the Agricultural Revolution. Indeed, no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  could  have  foreseen  much  of  anything  beyond  where  to  nd  the  next</p>
<p class="calibre1">meal. When farming began, there was no record of past events from which to</p>
<p class="calibre1">draw perspective on the future. There was not even a Western sense of time</p>
<p class="calibre1">divided into orderly units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure  out  the  years.  Foragers  lived  in  the  “eternal  present,”  without</p>
<p class="calibre1">calendars, and indeed, without written records at al . They had no science, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  no  other  intel ectual  apparatus  for  understanding  cause  and  e ect</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond their own intuitions. When it came to looking ahead, our primeval</p>
<p class="calibre1">64</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-445"></a>ancestors were blind. To cite the biblical metaphor, they had not yet eaten of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fruit of knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Learning from the Past</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, we have a better vantage point. The past  ve hundred generations</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  given  us  analytic  capabilities  that  our  forebears  lacked.  Science  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mathematics  have  helped  unlock  many  of  nature’s  secrets,  giving  us  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding  of  cause  and  e ect  that  approaches  the  magical  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared to that of the early foragers. Computational algorithms developed</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a result of high-speed computers have shed new insights on the workings of</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex,  dynamic  systems  like  the  human  economy.  The  painstaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">development  of  political  economy  itself,  although  it  fal s  wel   short  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection, has honed understanding of the factors informing human action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Important among these is the recognition that people at al  times and places</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend  to  respond  to  incentives.  Not  always  as  mechanical y  as  economists</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine, but they do respond. Costs and rewards matter. Changes in external</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions that raise the rewards or lower the costs of certain behavior wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead to more of that behavior, other things being-equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Incentives Matter</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  people  tend  to  respond  to  costs  and  rewards  is  an  essential</p>
<p class="calibre1">element of forecasting. You can say with a high degree of con dence that if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you drop a hundred-dol ar bil  on the street, someone wil  soon pick it up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether you are in New York, Mexico City, or Moscow. This is not as trivial</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  it  seems.  It  shows  why  the  clever  people  who  say  that  forecasting  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible are wrong. Any forecast that accurately anticipates the impact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentives  on  behavior  is  likely  to  be  broadly  correct.  And  the  greater  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipated change in costs and rewards, the less trivial the implied forecast is</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most far-reaching forecasts of al  are likely to arise from recognizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the implications of shifting megapolitical variables. Violence is the ultimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">boundary  force  on  behavior;  thus,  if  you  can  understand  how  the  logic  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">65</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-440"></a>violence wil  change, you can useful y predict where people wil  be dropping</p>
<p class="calibre1">or picking up the equivalent of one-hundred-dol ar bil s in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We do not mean by this that you can know the unknowable. We cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">tel  you how to forecast winning lottery numbers or any truly random event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  have  no  way  of  knowing  when  or  whether  a  terrorist  wil   detonate  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">atomic  blast  in  Manhattan.  Or  if  an  asteroid  wil   strike  Saudi  Arabia.  We</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot predict the coming of a new Ice Age, a sudden volcanic eruption, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  emergence  of  a  new  disease.  The  number  of  unknowable  events  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could alter the course of history is large. But knowing the unknowable is very</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent from drawing out the implications of what is already known. If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">see  a  ash  of  lightning  far  away,  you  can  forecast  with  a  high  degree  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">con dence  that  a  thunderclap  is  due.  Forecasting  the  consequences  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical transitions involves much longer time frames, and less certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">connections, but it is a similar kind of exercise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Megapolitical  catalysts  for  change  usual y  appear  wel   before  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  manifest  themselves.  It  took  ve  thousand  years  for  the  ful</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications  of  the  Agricultural  Revolution  to  come  to  the  surface.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition  from  an  agricultural  society  to  an  industrial  society  based  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacturing and chemical power unfolded more quickly. It took centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  transition  to  the  Information  Society  wil   happen  more  rapidly  stil , </p>
<p class="calibre1">probably  within  a  lifetime.  Yet  even  al owing  for  the  foreshortening  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history, you can expect decades to pass before the ful  megapolitical impact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">existing information technology is realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Major and Minor Megapolitical Transitions</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  chapter  analyzes  some  of  the  common  features  of  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">transitions.  In  fol owing  chapters  we  look  more  closely  at  the  Agricultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution,  and  the  transition  from  farm  to  factory,  the  second  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous  great  phase  changes.  Within  the  agricultural  stage  of  civilization</p>
<p class="calibre1">there were many minor megapolitical transitions such as the fal  of Rome and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the feudal revolution of the year 1000. These marked the waxing and waning</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the power equation as governments rose and fel  and the spoils of farming</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed  from  one  set  of  hands  to  another.  The  owners  of  sprawling  estates</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the Roman Empire, yeoman farmers in the European Dark Ages, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">66</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-387"></a>the lords and serfs of the feudal period al  ate grain from the same  elds. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived under very di erent governments because of the cumulative impact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent technologies,  uctuations in climate, and the disruptive in uences</p>
<p class="calibre1">of disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our purpose is not to thoroughly explain al  of these changes. We do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretend to do so, although we have sketched out some il ustrations of the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  changing  megapolitical  variables  have  altered  the  way  that  power  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercised in the past. Governments have grown and shrunk as megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">uctuations have lowered and raised the costs of projecting power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here are some summary points that you should keep in mind as you seek to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand the Information Revolution:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. A shift in the megapolitical foundations of power normal y unfolds far in</p>
<p class="calibre1">advance of the actual revolutions in the use of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Incomes are usual y fal ing when a major transition begins, often because a</p>
<p class="calibre1">society has rendered itself crisis-prone by marginalizing resources due to</p>
<p class="calibre1">population pressures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Seeing “outside” of a system is usual y taboo. People are frequently blind</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the logic of violence in the existing society; therefore, they are almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">always  blind  to  changes  in  that  logic,  latent  or  overt.  Megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">transitions are seldom recognized before they happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Major transitions always involve a cultural revolution, and usual y entail</p>
<p class="calibre1">clashes between adherents of the old and new values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Megapolitical  transitions  are  never  popular,  because  they  antiquate</p>
<p class="calibre1">painstakingly acquired intel ectual capital and confound established moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperatives. They are not undertaken by popular demand, but in response</p>
<p class="calibre1">to changes in the external conditions that alter the logic of violence in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">local setting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Transitions  to  new  ways  of  organizing  livelihoods  or  new  types  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government are initial y con ned to those areas where the megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">catalysts are at work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7. With the possible exception of the early stages of farming, past transitions</p>
<p class="calibre1">have always involved periods of social chaos and heightened violence due</p>
<p class="calibre1">to disorientation and breakdown of the old system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">67</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-60"></a>8. Corruption, moral decline, and ine ciency appear to be signal features of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nal stages of a system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9. The growing importance of technology in shaping the logic of violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">has led to an acceleration of history, leaving each successive transition with</p>
<p class="calibre1">less adaptive time than ever before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">History Speeds Up</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With  events  unfolding  many  times  faster  than  during  previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformations,  early  understanding  of  how  the  world  wil   change  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn  out  to  be  far  more  useful  to  you  than  it  would  have  been  to  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestors at an equivalent juncture in the past. Even if the  rst farmers had</p>
<p class="calibre1">miraculously  understood  the  ful   megapolitical  implications  of  til ing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth, this information would have been practical y useless because thousands</p>
<p class="calibre1">of years were to pass before the transition to the new phase of society was</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not so today. History has sped up. Forecasts that correctly anticipate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical implications of new technology are likely to be far more useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">today.  If  we  can  develop  the  implications  of  the  current  transition  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Society  to  the  same  extent  that  someone  with  current</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge  could  have  grasped  the  implications  of  past  transitions  to  farm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and factory, that information should be many times more valuable now. Put</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply, the action horizon for megapolitical forecasts has shrunk to its most</p>
<p class="calibre1">useful range, within the span of a single lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Looking back over the centuries, or even if looking only at the present, we can</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;FREDERIC C. LANE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our study of megapolitics is an attempt to do just that&mdash;to draw out the</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications of the changing factors that alter the boundaries where violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  exercised.  These  megapolitical  factors  largely  determine  when  and  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence pays. They also help inform the market distribution of income. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">68</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-61"></a>economic historian Frederic Lane so clearly put it, how violence is organized</p>
<p class="calibre1">and control ed plays a large role in determining “what uses are made of scarce</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">17</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A CRASH COURSE IN MEGAPOLITICS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The concept of megapolitics is a powerful one. It helps il uminate some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the major mysteries of history: how governments rise and fal  and what types</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  institutions  they  become;  the  timing  and  outcome  of  wars;  patterns  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic prosperity and decline. By raising or lowering the costs and rewards</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  projecting  power,  megapolitics  governs  the  ability  of  people  to  impose</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  wil   on  others.  This  has  been  true  from  the  earliest  human  societies</p>
<p class="calibre1">onward. It stil  is. We explored many of the important hidden megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">factors that determine the evolution of history in  <i class="calibre4">Blood in the Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Great  Reckoning. </i>  The  key  to  unlocking  the  implications  of  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">change is understanding the factors that precipitate revolutions in the use of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence.  These  variables  can  be  somewhat  arbitrarily  grouped  into  four</p>
<p class="calibre1">categories: topography, climate, microbes, and technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.  <i class="calibre4">Topography</i> is a crucial factor, as evidenced by the fact that control of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence on the open seas has never been monopolized as it has on land. No</p>
<p class="calibre1">government’s laws have ever exclusively applied there. This is a matter of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">utmost importance in understanding how the organization of violence and</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection wil  evolve as the economy migrates into cyberspace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Topography, in conjunction with climate, had a major role to play in early</p>
<p class="calibre1">history. The  rst states emerged on  oodplains, surrounded by desert, such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Mesopotamia  and  Egypt,  where  water  for  irrigation  was  plentiful  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding regions were too dry to support yeoman farming. Under such</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions, individual farmers faced a very high cost for failing to cooperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  maintaining  the  political  structure.  Without  irrigation,  which  could  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided  only  on  a  large  scale,  crops  would  not  grow.  No  crops  meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">starvation. The conditions that placed those who control ed the water in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">desert in a position of strength made for despotic and rich government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  we  analyzed  in   <i class="calibre4">The  Great  Reckoning, </i>  topographic  conditions  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">played a major role in the prosperity of yeoman farmers in ancient Greece, </p>
<p class="calibre1">enabling that region to become the cradle of Western democracy. Given the</p>
<p class="calibre1">69</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-62"></a>primitive  transportation  conditions  prevailing  in  the  Mediterranean  region</p>
<p class="calibre1">three  thousand  years  ago,  it  was  al   but  impossible  for  persons  living  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  a  few  miles  from  the  sea  to  compete  in  the  production  of  high-value</p>
<p class="calibre1">crops of the ancient world, olives and grapes. If the oil and the wine had to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">transported any distance overland, the portage costs were so great that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  be  sold  at  a  pro t.  The  elaborate  shoreline  of  the  Greek  littoral</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant that most areas of Greece were no more than twenty miles from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea.  This  gave  a  decisive  advantage  to  Greek  farmers  over  their  potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitors in landlocked areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of this advantage in trading high-value products, Greek farmers</p>
<p class="calibre1">earned high incomes from control of only smal  parcels of land. These high</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomes  enabled  them  to  purchase  costly  armor.  The  famous  hoplites  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancient Greece were farmers or landlords who armed themselves at their own</p>
<p class="calibre1">expense.  Both  wel   armed  and  wel   motivated,  the  Greek  hoplites  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">militarily formidable and could not be ignored. Topographic conditions were</p>
<p class="calibre1">the foundation of Greek democracy, just as those of a di erent kind gave rise</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the Oriental despotisms of Eygpt and elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  <i class="calibre4">Climate</i> also helps set the boundaries within which brute force can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercised.  A  climatic  change  was  the  catalyst  for  the  rst  major  transition</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  foraging  to  farming.  The  end  of  the  last  Ice  Age,  about  thirteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand years ago, led to a radical alteration in vegetation. Beginning in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Near East, where the Ice Age retreated  rst, a gradual rise in temperature and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rainfal   spread  forests  into  areas  that  had  previously  been  grasslands.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular,  the  rapid  spread  of  beech  forests  seriously  curtailed  the  human</p>
<p class="calibre1">diet. As Susan Ailing Gregg put it in  <i class="calibre4">Foragers and Farmers:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  establishment  of  beech  forests  must  have  had  serious  consequences  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">local  human,  plant  and  animal  populations.  The  canopy  of  an  oak  forest  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">relatively open and al ows large amounts of sunlight to reach the forest  oor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An exuberant undergrowth of mixed shrubs, forbs, and grasses develops, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the diversity of plants supports a variety of wildlife. In contrast, the canopy of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beech forest is closed and the forest  oor is heavily shaded. Other than a  ush</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  spring  annuals  prior  to  the  emergence  of  the  leaves,  only  shade-tolerant</p>
<p class="calibre1">sedges, ferns, and a few grasses are found. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”18</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">70</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-63"></a>Over  time,  dense  forests  encroached  on  the  open  plains,  spreading</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  Europe  into  the  Eastern  steppes<a href="#calibre_link-5">.19  </a>The  forests  reduced  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grazing area available to support large animals, making it increasingly di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the population of human foragers to support themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The population of hunter-gatherers had swol en too greatly during the Ice</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age prosperity to support itself on the dwindling herds of large mammals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  species  of  which  were  hunted  to  extinction.  The  transition  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">agriculture  was  not  a  choice  of  preference,  but  an  improvisation  adopted</p>
<p class="calibre1">under  duress  to  make  up  for  shortfal s  in  the  diet.  Foraging  continued  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominate in those areas farther north, where the warming trend had not</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversely a ected the habitats of large mammals, and in tropical rainforests, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where the global warming trend did not have the perverse e ect of reducing</p>
<p class="calibre1">food supplies. Since the advent of farming, it has been far more common for</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes  to  be  precipitated  by  the  cooling  rather  than  the  warming  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">climate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  modest  understanding  of  the  dynamics  of  climatic  change  in  past</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies  could  wel   prove  useful  in  the  event  that  climates  continue  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">uctuate.  If  you  know  that  a  drop  of  one  degree  Centigrade  on  average</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduces the growing season by three to four weeks and shaves  ve hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet o  the maximum elevation at which crops can be grown, then you know</p>
<p class="calibre1">something about the boundary conditions that wil  con ne people’s action in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the future<a href="#calibre_link-5">.20</a>  You  can  use  this  knowledge  to  forecast  changes  in  everything from  grain  prices  to  land  values.  You  may  even  be  able  to  draw  informed</p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusions about the likely impact of fal ing temperatures on real incomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and political stability. In the past, governments have been overthrown when</p>
<p class="calibre1">crop  failures  extending  over  several  years  raised  food  prices  and  shrank</p>
<p class="calibre1">disposable incomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, it is no coincidence that the seventeenth century, the coldest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the modern period, was also a period of revolution worldwide. A hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical cause of this unhappiness was sharply colder weather. It was so</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold, in fact, that wine froze on the “Sun King’s” table at Versail es. Shortened</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing  seasons  produced  crop  failures  and  undermined  real  income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the colder weather, prosperity began to wind down into a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">global depression that began around 1620. It proved drastical y destabilizing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  economic  crisis  of  the  seventeenth  century  led  to  the  world  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">71</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-64"></a>overwhelmed  by  rebel ions,  many  clustering  in  1648,  exactly  two  hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">years before another and more famous cycle of rebel ions. Between 1640 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">1650,  there  were  rebel ions  in  Ireland,  Scotland,  England,  Portugal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catalonia, France, Moscow, Naples, Sicily, Brazil, Bohemia, Ukraine, Austria, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Even China and Japan were</p>
<p class="calibre1">swept with unrest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  may  also  be  no  coincidence  that  mercantilism  predominated  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeenth  century  during  a  period  of  shrinking  trade.  Economic  closure</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  perhaps  most  pronounced  at  the  end  of  the  century,  “when  a  terrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">famine occurred.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">21</a> By the eighteenth century, especial y after 1750, warmer</p>
<p class="calibre1">temperatures  and  higher  crop  yields  had  begun  to  raise  real  incomes  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Western  Europe  su ciently  to  expand  demand  for  manufactured  goods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More free-market policies were adopted. This led to a self-reinforcing burst of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic growth as industry expanded to a larger scale in what is commonly</p>
<p class="calibre1">described  as  the  Industrial  Revolution.  The  growing  importance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology and manufactured output reduced the impact of the weather on</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic cycles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  today,  however,  you  should  not  underestimate  the  impact  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly colder weather in lowering real incomes&mdash;even in wealthy regions</p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  North  America.  There  is  a  strong  tendency  for  societies  to  render</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  crisis-prone  when  the  existing  con guration  of  institutions  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausted its potential. In the past, this tendency has often been manifested</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  population  increases  that  stretched  the  carrying  capacity  of  land  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">limit. This happened both before the transition of the year 1000 and again at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the  fteenth century. The plunge in real income caused by crop</p>
<p class="calibre1">failures  and  lower  yields  played  a  signi cant  role  in  both  instances  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying  the  predominant  institutions.  Today  the  marginalization  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested in the consumer credit markets. If sharply colder weather reduced</p>
<p class="calibre1">crop yields and lowered disposable incomes, this would lead to debt default as</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel   as  tax  rebel ions.  If  the  past  is  a  guide,  both  economic  closure  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political instability could result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  <i class="calibre4">Microbes</i> convey power to harm or immunity from harm in ways that</p>
<p class="calibre1">have often determined how power was exercised. This was certainly the case</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the European conquest of the New World, as we explored in  <i class="calibre4">The Great</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Reckoning. </i>  European  settlers,  arriving  from  settled  agricultural  societies</p>
<p class="calibre1">72</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-439"></a>riddled with disease, brought with them relative immunity from childhood</p>
<p class="calibre1">infections like measles. The Indians they encountered lived largely in thinly</p>
<p class="calibre1">populated  foraging  bands.  They  possessed  no  such  immunity  and  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">decimated. Often, the greatest mortality occurred before white people even</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived,  as  Indians  who  rst  encountered  Europeans  on  the  coasts  traveled</p>
<p class="calibre1">inland with infections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are also microbiological barriers to the exercise of power. In  <i class="calibre4">Blood</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">in the Streets, </i>  we  discussed  the  role  that  potent  strains  of  malaria  served  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">making  tropical  Africa  impervious  to  invasion  by  white  men  for  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries.  Before  the  discovery  of  quinine  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century, </p>
<p class="calibre1">white  armies  could  not  survive  in  malarial  regions,  however  superior  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons might have been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  interaction  between  humans  and  microbes  has  also  produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">important demographic e ects that altered the costs and rewards of violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  uctuations in mortality are high due to epidemic disease, famine, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  causes,  the  relative  risk  of  mortality  in  warfare  fal s.  The  declining</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency  of  eruptions  in  death  rates  from  the  sixteenth  century  onward</p>
<p class="calibre1">helps  explain  smal er  family  size  and,  ultimately,  the  far  lower  tolerance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden death in war today as compared to the past. This has had the e ect of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowering  the  tolerance  for  imperialism  and  raising  the  costs  of  projecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">power in societies with low birthrates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary societies, comprising smal  families, tend to  nd even smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers of battle deaths intolerable. By contrast, early modern societies were</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  more  tolerant  of  the  mortality  costs  associated  with  imperialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before this century, most parents gave birth to many children, some of whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">were expected to die randomly and suddenly from disease. In an era when</p>
<p class="calibre1">early death was commonplace, would-be soldiers and their families faced the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangers of the battle eld with less resistance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;EMERSON</p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  <i class="calibre4">Technology</i> has played by far the largest role in determining the costs and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewards of projecting power during the modern centuries. The argument of</p>
<p class="calibre1">73</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-383"></a>this book presumes it wil  continue to do so. Technology has several crucial</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimensions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">A.  <i class="calibre4">Balance between offense and defense. </i> The balance between the o ense and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the defense implied by prevailing weapons technology helps determine the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale of political organization. When o ensive capabilities are rising, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability to project power at a distance predominates, jurisdictions tend to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consolidate, and governments form on a larger scale. At other times, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, defensive capabilities are rising. This makes it more costly to project</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  outside  of  core  areas.  Jurisdictions  tend  to  devolve,  and  big</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments break down into smal er ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B.  <i class="calibre4">Equality and the predominance of the infantry. </i> A key feature determining</p>
<p class="calibre1">the degree of equality among citizens is the nature of weapons technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons that are relatively cheap, can be employed by nonprofessionals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and enhance the military importance of infantry tend to equalize power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Thomas  Je erson  wrote  that  “al   men  are  created  equal,”  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying  something  that  was  much  more  true  than  a  similar  statement</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have seemed centuries earlier. A farmer with his hunting ri e was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not only as wel  armed as the typical British soldier with his Brown Bess, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he was better armed. The farmer with the ri e could shoot at the soldier</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a greater distance, and with greater accuracy than the soldier could</p>
<p class="calibre1">return  re. This was a distinctly di erent circumstance from the Middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ages, when a farmer with a pitchfork&mdash;he could not have a orded more</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;could scarcely have hoped to stand against a heavily armed knight on</p>
<p class="calibre1">horseback. No one was writing in 1276 that “al  men are created equal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, in the most manifestly important sense, men were not equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A single knight exercised far more brute force than dozens of peasants put</p>
<p class="calibre1">together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">C.  <i class="calibre4">Advantages  and  disadvantages  of  scale  in  violence. </i>  Another  variable  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">helps determine whether there are a few large governments or many smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones is the scale of organization required to deploy the prevailing weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  there  are  increasing  returns  to  violence,  it  is  more  rewarding  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">operate  governments  at  a  large  scale;  therefore  governments  tend  to  get</p>
<p class="calibre1">bigger. When a smal  group can command e ective means of resisting an</p>
<p class="calibre1">assault  by  a  large  group,  which  was  the  case  during  the  Middle  Ages, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  tends  to  fragment.  Smal ,  independent  authorities  exercise</p>
<p class="calibre1">74</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-477"></a>many of the functions of government. As we explore in a latter chapter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we believe that the Information Age wil  bring the dawn of cybersoldiers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who wil  be heralds of devolution. Cybersoldiers could be deployed not</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely  by  nation-states  but  by  very  smal   organizations,  and  even  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals.  Wars  of  the  next  mil ennium  wil   include  some  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodless battles fought with computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">D.  <i class="calibre4">Economies of scale in production. </i> Another important factor that weighs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the balance in determining whether ultimate power is exercised local y or</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a distance is the scale of the predominant enterprises in which people</p>
<p class="calibre1">gain  their  livelihoods.  When  crucial  enterprises  can  function  optimal y</p>
<p class="calibre1">only when they are organized on a large scale in an encompassing trading</p>
<p class="calibre1">area,  governments  that  expand  to  provide  such  a  setting  for  enterprises</p>
<p class="calibre1">under their protection may rake o  enough additional wealth to pay the</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs of maintaining a large political system. Under such conditions, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  world  economy  usual y  functions  more  e ectively  where  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">supreme world power dominates al  others, as the British Empire did in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the nineteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  sometimes  megapolitical  variables  combine  to  produce  fal ing</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies of scale. If the economic bene ts of maintaining a large trading</p>
<p class="calibre1">area  dwindle,  larger  governments  that  previously  prospered  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploiting the bene ts of encompassing trading areas may begin to break</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart&mdash;even  if  the  balance  of  weaponry  between  o ense  and  defense</p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise remains much as it had been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">E.  <i class="calibre4">Dispersal of technology. </i> Stil  another factor that contributes to the power</p>
<p class="calibre1">equation is the degree of dispersal of key technologies. When weapons or</p>
<p class="calibre1">tools of production can be e ectively hoarded or monopolized, they tend</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  centralize  power.  Even  technologies  that  are  essential y  defensive  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">character, like the machine gun, proved to be potent o ensive weapons, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that contributed to a rising scale of governance during the period when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  were  not  widely  dispersed.  When  the  European  powers  enjoyed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly on machine guns late in the nineteenth century, they were able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  use  those  weapons  against  peoples  at  the  periphery  to  dramatical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">expand colonial empires. Later, in the twentieth century, when machine</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns became widely available, especial y in the wake of World War II, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were deployed to help destroy the power of empires. Other things being</p>
<p class="calibre1">75</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-309"></a>equal,  the  more  widely  dispersed  key  technologies  are,  the  more  widely</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispersed  power  wil   tend  to  be,  and  the  smal er  the  optimum  scale  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE SPEED OF MEGAPOLITICAL CHANGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While technology is by far the most important factor today, and apparently</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing  more  so,  al   four  major  megapolitical  factors  have  played  a  role  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">determining the scale at which power could be exercised in the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together,  these  factors  determine  whether  the  returns  to  violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue to rise as violence is employed on a larger scale. This determines the</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  magnitude  of  repower  versus  e ciency  in  employing</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources. It also strongly in uences the market distribution of income. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">question is, What role wil  they command in the future? A key to estimating</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  answer  lies  in  recognizing  that  these  megapolitical  variables  mutate  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatical y di erent speeds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Topography has been almost  xed through the whole of recorded history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except  for  minor  local  e ects  involving  the  silting  of  harbors,  land l s,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">erosion, the topography of the earth is almost the same today as it was when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam  and  Eve  straggled  out  of  Eden.  And  it  is  likely  to  remain  so  until</p>
<p class="calibre1">another Ice Age recarves the landscapes of continents or some other drastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">event disturbs the surface of the earth. At a more profound scale, geological</p>
<p class="calibre1">ages seem to shift, perhaps in response to large meteorite strikes, over a period</p>
<p class="calibre1">of 10 to 40 mil ion years. Someday, there may again be geological upheavals</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wil  alter signi cantly the topography of our planet. If that happens, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can safely assume that both the basebal  and cricket seasons wil  be canceled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Climate  uctuates  much  more  actively  than  topography.  In  the  last</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ion  years,  climatic  change  has  been  responsible  for  most  of  the  known</p>
<p class="calibre1">variation  in  the  features  of  the  earth’s  surface.  During  Ice  Ages,  glaciers</p>
<p class="calibre1">gouged  new  val eys,  altered  the  course  of  rivers,  severed  islands  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">continents or joined them together by lowering the sea level. Fluctuations in</p>
<p class="calibre1">climate  have  played  a  signi cant  role  in  history,  rst  in  precipitating  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agricultural  Revolution  after  the  close  of  the  last  Ice  Age,  and  later  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">destabilizing regimes during periods of colder temperatures and drought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">76</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-65"></a>Lately,  there  have  been  concerns  over  the  possible  impact  of  “global</p>
<p class="calibre1">warming.”  These  concerns  cannot  be  dismissed  out  of  hand.  Yet,  taking  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer perspective, the more likely risk appears to be a shift toward a colder, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not a warmer climate. Study of temperature  uctuations based upon analysis</p>
<p class="calibre1">of oxygen isotopes in core samples taken from the ocean  oor show that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">current  period  is  the  second  warmest  in  more  than  2  mil ion  years. <a href="#calibre_link-5">22  </a>If temperatures were to turn colder, as they did in the seventeenth century, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">might  prove  megapolitical y  destabilizing.  Current  alarms  about  global</p>
<p class="calibre1">warming may in that sense be reassuring. To the extent that they are true, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">assures  that  temperatures  wil   continue  to  uctuate  within  the  abnormal y</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm and relatively benign range experienced for the past three centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rate of change in the in uence of microbes on the exercise of power is</p>
<p class="calibre1">more of a puzzle. Microbes can mutate very rapidly. This is especial y true of</p>
<p class="calibre1">viruses. The common cold, for example, mutates in an almost kaleidoscopic</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. Yet although these mutations proceed apace, their impact in shifting the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boundaries  where  power  is  exercised  have  been  far  less  abrupt  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological change. Why? Part of the reason is that the normal balance of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature tends to make it bene cial for microbes to infect but not destroy host</p>
<p class="calibre1">populations.  Virulent  infections  that  kil   their  hosts  too  readily  tend  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">eradicate themselves in the process. The survival of microparasites depends</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon their not being too rapidly or uniformly fatal to the hosts they invade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  there  cannot  be  deadly  eruptions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease  that  alter  the  balance  of  power.  Such  episodes  have  gured</p>
<p class="calibre1">prominently  in  history.  The  Black  Death  wiped  out  large  fractions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">population of Eurasia and dealt a crushing blow to the fourteenth-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">version of the international economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">What Might Have Been</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">History can be understood in terms of what might have been as wel  as what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was. We know of no reason that microparasites could not have continued to</p>
<p class="calibre1">play havoc with human society during the modern period. For example, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible that microbiological barriers to the exercise of power, equivalent to</p>
<p class="calibre1">malaria  but  more  virulent,  could  have  halted  the  Western  invasion  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">periphery in its tracks. The  rst intrepid Portuguese adventurers who sailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">77</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-310"></a>into  African  waters  could  have  contracted  a  deadly  retrovirus,  a  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicable version of AIDS, that would have stopped the opening of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new trade route to Asia before it even began. Columbus, too, and the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">waves  of  settlers  in  the  New  World  might  have  encountered  diseases  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">decimated  them  in  the  same  way  that  indigenous  local  populations  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">a ected by measles and other Western childhood diseases. Yet nothing of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind happened, a coincidence that underlines the intuition that history has a</p>
<p class="calibre1">destiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microbes did far less to impede the consolidation of power in the modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">period  than  to  facilitate  it.  Western  troops  and  colonists  at  the  periphery</p>
<p class="calibre1">often found that the technological advantages that al owed them to project</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  were  underscored  by  microbiological  ones.  Westerners  were  armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  unseen  biological  weapons,  their  relative  immunity  to  childhood</p>
<p class="calibre1">diseases  that  frequently  devastated  native  peoples.  This  gave  voyagers  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the West a distinct advantage that their antagonists from less densely settled</p>
<p class="calibre1">regions lacked. As events unfolded, the disease transfer was almost entirely in</p>
<p class="calibre1">one direction&mdash;from Europe outward. There was no equivalent transfer of</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease in the other direction, from the periphery to the core. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a possible counterexample, some have claimed that Western explorers</p>
<p class="calibre1">imported syphilis from the New World to Europe. This is arguable. If true, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, it did not prove to be a signi cant barrier to the exercise of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The major impact of syphilis was to shift sexual mores in the West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the end of the  fteenth century to the last quarter of the twentieth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  impact  of  microbes  on  industrial  society  was  ever  more  benign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  personal  tragedies  and  unhappiness  caused  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">outbreaks  of  tuberculosis,  polio,  and  u,  no  new  diseases  emerged  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern  period  that  even  approached  the  megapolitical  impact  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Antonine  plagues  or  the  Black  Death.  Improving  public  health,  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">advent  of  vaccinations  and  antidotes,  general y  reduced  the  importance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">infectious microbes during the modern period, thereby increasing the relative</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  technology  in  setting  the  boundaries  where  power  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  recent  emergence  of  AIDS  and  alarms  over  the  potential  spread  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">exotic  viruses  are  hints  that  the  role  of  microbes  may  not  be  altogether  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical y benign in the future as it has been over the past  ve hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">78</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-478"></a>years. But when or whether a new plague wil  infect the world is unknowable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An eruption of microparasites, such as a viral pandemic, rather than drastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes  in  climate  or  topography,  would  more  likely  disrupt  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical predominance of technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have no way of monitoring or anticipating drastic departures from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature of life on earth as we have known it. We cross our  ngers and assume</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  major  megapolitical  variables  in  the  next  mil ennium  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological  rather  than  microbiological.  If  luck  continues  to  side  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">humanity,  technology  wil   continue  to  grow  in  prominence  as  the  leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical variable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not always such, however, as a review of the  rst great megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformation, the Agricultural Revolution, clearly shows. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;GENESIS 4:9-10</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five hundred generations ago, the  rst phase change in the organization of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human society began. <a href="#calibre_link-5">1 </a>Our ancestors in several regions reluctantly picked up</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude implements, sharpened stakes and makeshift hoes, and went to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they sowed the  rst crops, they also laid a new foundation for power in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. The Agricultural Revolution was the  rst great economic and social</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolution. It started with the expulsion from Eden and moved so slowly that</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming had not completely displaced hunting and gathering in al  suitable</p>
<p class="calibre1">areas of the globe when the twentieth century opened. Experts believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">even in the Near East, where farming  rst emerged, it was introduced in “a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long  incremental  process”  that  “may  have  taken  ve  thousand  years  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It may seem an exaggeration to describe a process that stretched out over</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennia as a “revolution.” Yet that is precisely what the advent of farming</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,  a  slow-motion  revolution  that  transformed  human  life  by  altering  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">logic  of  violence.  Wherever  farming  took  root,  violence  emerged  as  a  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important  feature  of  social  life.  Hierarchies  adept  at  manipulating  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ing violence came to dominate society. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the character of work can radical y alter the organization of society. Put this</p>
<p class="calibre1">past  revolution  into  perspective  and  you  are  in  a  far  stronger  position  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">forecast  how  history  may  unfold  in  response  to  the  new  logic  of  violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced with microprocessors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To appreciate the revolutionary character of agriculture, you  rst need a</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture of how the primeval society functioned before farming. We surveyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">this in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i> and o er a further sketch below. Hunting-and-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering societies were the only forms of social organization through a long, </p>
<p class="calibre1">prehistoric  slumber  when  human  life  changed  little  or  not  at  al   from</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation  to  generation.  Anthropologists  claim  that  humans  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunters and gatherers for 99 percent of the time since we appeared on earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crucial  to  the  long  success  and  ultimate  failure  of  hunting-and-gathering</p>
<p class="calibre1">bands is the fact that they had to operate on a very smal  scale over a very wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">area.Foragers could survive only where population densities were light. To see</p>
<p class="calibre1">why,  think  of  the  problems  that  larger  groups  would  have  posed.  For  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, a thousand hunters parading together across a landscape would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised such a ruckus as to scare away the game they sought to trap. And even</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse, had a smal  army of hunters occasional y managed to corner a huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">herd  of  game,  the  food  they  harvested,  including  fruits  and  edible  plants</p>
<p class="calibre1">found in the wild, could not have remained plentiful for long. A large group</p>
<p class="calibre1">of foragers would have laid waste to the countryside through overharvesting</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a starving army in the Thirty Years War. Therefore, to minimize overkil , </p>
<p class="calibre1">hunting  bands  had  to  be  smal .  As  Stephen  Boyden  writes  in   <i class="calibre4">Western</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Civilization  in  Biological  Perspective, </i>  “Most  commonly,  hunter-gatherer</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups number between twenty- ve and  fty individuals. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">To  live  on  ten  thousand  acres  in  a  temperate  climate  today  is  a  luxury</p>
<p class="calibre1">al owed only to the very rich. A family of hunter-gatherers could scarcely have</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived on less. They general y required thousands of acres per person, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">in areas that were most fertile for foraging. This suggests why the growth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human  populations  during  periods  particularly  favorable  to  foraging  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  created  the  basis  for  population  crises.  Because  so  much  land  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">81</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-68"></a>required to support a single person, the population densities of hunting-and-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering societies had to be incredibly sparse. Before farming, humans were</p>
<p class="calibre1">about as densely settled as bears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With minor di erences, the human diet resembled that of bears. Foraging</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies depended upon food gathered from the open countryside or from</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby  bodies  of  water.  Although  some  gatherers  were  shers,  most  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunters who depended for a third to a  fth of their food upon protein from</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  mammals.  Other  than  a  few  simple  tools  and  objects  carried  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">with them, hunter-gatherers had almost no technology at their disposal. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual y had no way to e ectively store quantities of meat or other foods for</p>
<p class="calibre1">later use. Most food had to be consumed soon after it was gathered or left to</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoil.  That  is  not  say,  of  course,  that  some  hunter-gatherers  did  not  eat</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoiled food. Eskimos, as Boyden reports, “are said to have a particular liking</p>
<p class="calibre1">for decomposed food. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”4</a> He repeats the observations of experts that Eskimos</p>
<p class="calibre1">“ ‘bury  sh heads and al ow them to decay until the bones become of the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">consistency as the  esh. They then knead the reeking mass into a paste and eat</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’; they also enjoy the ‘fat maggoty larvae of the caribou  y served raw … deer</p>
<p class="calibre1">droppings,  munched  like  berries…  and  marrow  more  than  a  year  old, </p>
<p class="calibre1">swarming with maggots.’ ” <a href="#calibre_link-5">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  than  such  delicacies,  foragers  developed  little  surplus  food.  As</p>
<p class="calibre1">anthropologist  Gregg  notes,  “mobile  populations  general y  do  not  store</p>
<p class="calibre1">foodstu s  against  seasonal  or  unexpected  lows  in  resource  availability.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently, foragers had little to steal. A division of labor that included</p>
<p class="calibre1">specialization to employ violence was insupportable in settings where surplus</p>
<p class="calibre1">food could not be stored. The logic of the hunt also dictated that violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">among  hunting-and-foraging  bands  could  never  rise  above  a  smal   scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the groups themselves had to remain tiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  smal   scale  of  foraging  bands  was  advantageous  in  another  way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Members of such smal  groups would have known one another intimately, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">factor that made them more e ective in working together. Decision-making</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes  more  di cult  as  numbers  rise,  because  incentive  traps  proliferate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You need only think how hard it is to get a dozen people organized to go out</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  dinner.  Imagine  how  hopeless  would  have  been  the  task  of  organizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds  or  thousands  of  persons  to  traipse  around  on  a  moveable  feast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lacking  any  sustained  and  separate  political  organization  or  bureaucracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">82</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-69"></a>required  by  specialization  for  war,  hunting-and-gathering  bands  had  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">depend on persuasion and consensus&mdash;principles that work best among smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups with relatively easygoing attitudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether hunting-and-gathering bands were easygoing is open to debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir Henry Maine refers to “the universal bel igerency of primitive man.” In</p>
<p class="calibre1">his words, “It is not peace which is natural and primitive but war. <a href="#calibre_link-5">”6 </a>His view</p>
<p class="calibre1">has been underlined by the work of evolutionary biologists. R. Paul Shaw and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yuwa  Wong  comment:  “[T]here  are  strong  indications  that  many  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">injuries apparent in remains of Australopithecus, Homo erectus, and Homo</p>
<p class="calibre1">sapiens of the European fourth and pre-fourth glacial periods resulted from</p>
<p class="calibre1">combat.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">7  </a>But  others  doubt  this.  Experts  like  Stephen  Boyden  argue  that primitive  groups  were  usual y  not  warlike  or  prone  to  violence.  Social</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventions developed to reduce internal tensions and facilitate the sharing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the hunt. Especial y in areas where humans preyed on larger game, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was di cult for a single hunter to fel , religious and social doctrines emerged</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  facilitate  the  redistribution  of  any  game  that  was  taken  with  the  whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">group.  The  rst  priority  of  sharing  of  caloric  resources  was  with  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunters. Necessity, rather than sentiment, was the spur. The  rst claim on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  was  exercised  by  the  most  economical y  competent  and  militarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong,  not  by  the  sick  and  the  weak.  Undoubtedly,  a  major  in uence</p>
<p class="calibre1">informing this priority was the fact that hunters in the prime of life were also</p>
<p class="calibre1">militarily  the  most  potent  members  of  the  smal   band.  By  assuring  them  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst  claim  on  the  hunt,  the  group  minimized  potential y  lethal  internal</p>
<p class="calibre1">squabbling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So long as population densities remained low, the foragers’ gods were not</p>
<p class="calibre1">militant gods but embodiments of natural forces or the animals they hunted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  scantiness  of  capital  and  open  frontiers  made  war  in  most  cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">unnecessary. There were few neighbors outside one’s own smal  family or clan</p>
<p class="calibre1">to pose threats. Because foragers tended to roam in search of food, personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessions  beyond  a  bare  minimum  became  an  encumbrance.  Those  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">few possessions necessarily experienced little property crime. When con icts</p>
<p class="calibre1">arose, the contending parties were often content to walk away because they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had little invested in any given locale. Escape was an easy solution to personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">feuds or exorbitant demands of other kinds. This does not mean that early</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans  were  peaceful.  They  may  have  been  violent  and  unpleasant  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">83</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-70"></a>degree we can scarcely imagine. But if they employed violence, it was mostly</p>
<p class="calibre1">for personal reasons or, what may be worse, for sport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The livelihoods of hunter-gatherers depended upon their functioning in</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  bands that al owed little or no scope for a division of labor other than</p>
<p class="calibre1">along  gender  lines.  They  had  no  organized  government,  usual y  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">permanent  settlements,  and  no  possibility  for  accumulating  wealth.  Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">such basic building blocks of civilization as a written language were unknown</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  primeval  economy.  Without  a  written  language  there  could  be  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">formal records and no history. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Overkill</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The dynamic of foraging created very di erent incentives to work than those</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  which  we  have  become  accustomed  since  the  advent  of  farming.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital requirements for life as a forager were minimal. A few primitive tools</p>
<p class="calibre1">and weapons su ced. There was no outlet for investment, not even private</p>
<p class="calibre1">property in land, except occasional y in quarries where  int or soapstone was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mined. <a href="#calibre_link-5">8</a>  As  anthropologist  Susan  Ailing  Gregg  wrote  in   <i class="calibre4">Foragers  and</i> <i class="calibre4">Farmers, </i> “Ownership of and access to resources” was “held in common by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the group.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">9 </a>With rare exceptions, such as  shers living on the shores of lakes, foragers usual y had no  xed place of abode. Having no permanent homes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they had little need to work hard to acquire property or maintain it. They had</p>
<p class="calibre1">no mortgage or taxes to pay, no furniture to buy. Their few consumer goods</p>
<p class="calibre1">were animal skins, and personal adornments made by members of the group</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves. There was little incentive to acquire or accumulate anything that</p>
<p class="calibre1">might  have  passed  for  money  because  there  was  little  to  buy.  Under  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions,  savings  for  the  foragers  could  have  been  no  more  than  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rudimentary concept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With no reason to earn and almost no division of labor, the concept of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard  work  as  a  virtue  must  have  been  foreign  to  hunting-and-gathering</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups. Except during periods of unusual hardship, when protracted e ort</p>
<p class="calibre1">was required to  nd something to eat, little work was done because little was</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed. There was literal y nothing to be gained by working beyond the bare</p>
<p class="calibre1">minimum required for survival. For the members of the typical hunting-and-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering  band,  that  meant  working  only  about  eight  to  fteen  hours  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">84</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-71"></a>week<a href="#calibre_link-5">.10 </a>Because a hunter’s labor did not augment the food supply but could only reduce it, one who heroical y labored overtime to kil  more animals or</p>
<p class="calibre1">pick more fruit than could be eaten before it spoiled contributed nothing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperity. To the contrary, overkil  reduced the prospects of  nding food in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the future, and thus had a detrimental impact on the wel -being of the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why some foragers, such as Eskimos, punished or ostracized members</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the band who engaged in overkil . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  example  of  the  Eskimos  punishing  overkil   is  particularly  tel ing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because they, far more than others, might wel  have been able to store meat by</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezing  it.  Further,  it  would  have  been  feasible  to  provide  at  least  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">storage  for  oils  rendered  from  large  marine  animals.  The  fact  that  foragers</p>
<p class="calibre1">general y chose not to do so re ects their far more passive interactions with</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature.  It  may  also  indicate  the  degree  to  which  cognition  and  mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes  are  biased  by  culture.  Constraints  on  learning  and  behavior  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex  environments  make  adoption  of  some  strategies  far  more  di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">than would otherwise appear. As R. Paul Shaw and Yuwa Wong have written, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because niches di er in many respects, so, too, do biases in learning.” <a href="#calibre_link-5">11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen  in  this  perspective,  the  advent  of  agriculture  entailed  more  than  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">change  in  diet;  it  also  launched  a  great  revolution  in  the  organization  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic life and culture as wel  as a transformation of the logic of violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farming created large-scale capital assets in land and sometimes in irrigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems.  The  crops  and  domesticated  animals  farmers  raised  were  valuable</p>
<p class="calibre1">assets. They could be stored, hoarded, and stolen. Because crops had to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended  over  the  entire  growing  season,  from  planting  through  harvest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">migration away from threats became less attractive, especial y in arid regions</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  opportunities  to  grow  crops  were  con ned  to  the  smal   areas  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">land  with  dependable  water  supplies.  As  escape  became  more  di cult, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities for organized shakedowns and plunder increased. Farmers were</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject to raids at harvesttime, which gradual y raised the scale of warfare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This tended to increase the size of societies because contests of violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">more often than not were won by the larger group. As competition over land</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  control  of  its  output  became  more  intense,  societies  became  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">stationary.  A  division  of  labor  became  more  apparent.  Employment  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slavery arose for the  rst time. Farmers and herders specialized in producing</p>
<p class="calibre1">food. Potters produced containers in which food was stored. Priests prayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">85</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-313"></a>for  rain  and  bountiful  harvests.  Specialists  in  violence,  the  forefathers  of government, increasingly devoted themselves to plunder and protection from</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunder.  Along  with  the  priests,  they  became  the  rst  wealthy  persons  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early stages of agricultural societies, these warriors came to control a</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion of the annual crop as a price of protection. In places where threats</p>
<p class="calibre1">were minimal, yeoman farmers were sometimes able to retain a relatively large</p>
<p class="calibre1">degree of autonomy. But as population densities rose, and competition over</p>
<p class="calibre1">food intensi ed, especial y in regions around deserts where productive land</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  at  a  premium,  the  warrior  group  could  take  a  large  fraction  of  total</p>
<p class="calibre1">output. These warriors founded the  rst states with the proceeds of this rake-</p>
<p class="calibre1">o , which reached as high as 25 percent of the grain crop and one-half the</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  in  herds  of  domesticated  animals.  Farming,  therefore,  dramatical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">increased the importance of coercion. The surge in resources capable of being</p>
<p class="calibre1">plundered led to a large surge in plunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took mil ennia for the ful  logic of the Agricultural Revolution to play</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself  out.  For  a  long  while,  sparse  populations  of  farmers  in  temperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">regions  may  have  lived  much  as  their  foraging  forebears  had  done.  Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">land and rainfal  were ample, farmers harvested crops on a smal  scale without</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  violent  interference.  But  as  populations  rose  over  a  period  of  several</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand  years,  farmers  even  in  thinly  settled  regions  became  subject  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">erratic plunder that sometimes must have left them with insu cient seed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">replant  the  next  year’s  crop.  Competitive  plundering,  or  anarchy,  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibility at one extreme, as wel  as unprotected communities living without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any specialized organization to monopolize violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As time passed, the logic of violence inherent in agriculture imposed itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">over  an  ever-wider  terrain.  The  regions  where  farming  and  herding  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue without the predations of government receded to a few truly remote</p>
<p class="calibre1">areas. The Ka r regions of Afghanistan, to cite an extreme example, resisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the imposition of government until the last decade of the nineteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in so doing, they were transformed centuries earlier into a quite militant</p>
<p class="calibre1">society, organized along kinship lines. Such arrangements were not capable of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mustering force on a large scale. Until the British brought modern weapons</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the region, the Ka rs remained independent in their remote Bashgal and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Waigal  val eys  because  their  redoubts  were  protected  by  features  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">86</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-72"></a>topography,  high  mountains,  and  deserts  that  stood  between  them  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conquerors from the outside. <a href="#calibre_link-6">12</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Over time, the basic logic of the Agricultural Revolution impressed itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the societies where farming took hold. Farming sharply raised the scale at</p>
<p class="calibre1">which human communities could form. Beginning about ten thousand years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago, cities began to emerge. Although tiny by today's standards, they were the</p>
<p class="calibre1">centers of the  rst “civilizations,” a word derived from  <i class="calibre4">civitas, </i> which means</p>
<p class="calibre1">“citizenship”  or  “inhabitants  of  a  city”  in  Latin.  Because  farming  created</p>
<p class="calibre1">assets to plunder and to protect, it also created a requirement for inventory</p>
<p class="calibre1">accounting. You cannot tax unless you can compile records and issue receipts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The symbols employed in the accountant's ledger became the rudiments of</p>
<p class="calibre1">written language, an innovation that had never existed among hunters and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gatherers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farming  also  extended  the  horizon  over  which  humans  had  to  solve</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems.  Hunting  bands  lived  within  an  immediate  time  horizon.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">seldom undertook projects that lasted more than a few days. But planting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">harvesting a crop took months. Pursuing projects of a longer time frame led</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmers  to  train  their  attentions  on  the  stars.  Detailed  astronomical</p>
<p class="calibre1">observations were a precondition for drawing up almanacs and calendars to</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve as guides on when to best plant and reap. With the advent of farming, </p>
<p class="calibre1">human horizons expanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PROPERTY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The move to a settled agricultural society resulted in the emergence of private</p>
<p class="calibre1">property.  Obviously,  no  one  would  be  content  to  toil  through  the  whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing season to produce a crop just to see someone else wander along and</p>
<p class="calibre1">harvest  what  he  produced.  The  idea  of  property  emerged  as  an  inevitable</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequence of farming. But the clarity of private property as a concept was</p>
<p class="calibre1">attenuated by the logic of violence that also accompanied the introduction of</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming.  The  emergence  of  property  was  confused  by  the  fact  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical power of individuals was no longer as equal as it had been in</p>
<p class="calibre1">foraging societies, where every healthy adult male was a hunter, as wel  armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  anyone  else.  Farming  gave  rise  to  specialization  in  violence.  Precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">87</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-426"></a>because  it  created  something  to  steal,  farming  made  investments  in  better</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaponry pro table. The result was theft, much of it highly organized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The powerful were now able to organize a new form of predation: a local</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly  of  violence,  or  government.  This  sharply  di erentiated  society, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating  quite  di erent  circumstances  for  those  who  bene ted  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunder, and the mass of poor who til ed the  elds. The few who control ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">military power could now become rich, along with others who found favor</p>
<p class="calibre1">with them. The god-kings and their al ies, the various lesser, local potentates</p>
<p class="calibre1">who ruled the  rst Near Eastern states, enjoyed much more nearly modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms of property than the great mass who toiled beneath them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it is anachronistic to think of a distinction between private and</p>
<p class="calibre1">public wealth in the early agricultural societies. The ruling god-king had the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ful   resources  of  the  state  at  his  disposal  in  a  way  that  could  hardly  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguished  from  ownership  of  a  sprawling  estate.  Much  as  in  the  feudal</p>
<p class="calibre1">period of European history, al  property was subject to the overlordship of</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher potentates. Those down the chain of hierarchy found their property</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject to attenuation at the whim of the ruler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet to say that the potentate was not restrained by law does not mean that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  could  a ord  to  seize  anything  he  pleased.  Costs  and  rewards  impinged</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the freedom of the pharaoh as much as they do today upon the prime</p>
<p class="calibre1">minister  of  Canada.  And  the  pharaoh  was  much  more  constrained  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemporary  leaders  by  the  di culties  of  transport  and  communication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply  hauling  loot  from  one  spot  to  the  next,  especial y  when  loot  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">measured mainly in the form of agricultural produce, involved a lot of loss</p>
<p class="calibre1">from spoilage and theft. The proliferation of o cials to check on one another</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduced the loss due to pilfering but increased the total overhead costs the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pharaoh had to bear. Decentralized authority, which optimized output under</p>
<p class="calibre1">some circumstances, also gave rise to stronger local powers who sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">blossomed  into  ful - edged  chal engers  for  dynastic  control.  Even  Oriental</p>
<p class="calibre1">despots were by no means free to do as they pleased. They had no choice but</p>
<p class="calibre1">to recognize the balance of raw power as they found it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  everyone,  including  the  rich,  was  subject  to  arbitrary</p>
<p class="calibre1">expropriation, some were able to accumulate property of their own. Then as</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, the state devoted much of its income to public works. Projects such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">irrigation  systems,  religious  monuments,  and  crypts  for  the  kings  provided</p>
<p class="calibre1">88</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-315"></a>opportunities for architects and artisans to earn income. Some wel -situated</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals were able to accumulate considerable private property. In fact, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  portion  of  the  surviving  cuneiform  tablets  from  Sumer,  an  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mesopotamian  civilization,  record  various  acts  of  trade,  most  of  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">involve the transfer of property titles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was private property in the early agricultural societies, but seldom</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  bottom  of  the  social  pyramid.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">population were peasants who were too poor to accumulate much wealth. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, with a few exceptions, most peasants, up until modern times, were so</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor that they stood in constant danger of perishing from starvation any time</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  a  drought  or  a  ood  or  an  infestation  reduced  crop  yields.  Hence  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">peasants  were  obliged  to  organize  their  a airs  in  a  way  that  minimized  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">downside risks in bad years. Across the broad and impoverished stratum of</p>
<p class="calibre1">society, a more primitive organization of property obtained. It increased the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance  of  survival  at  the  expense  of  foreclosing  the  greater  part  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity to accumulate capital and rise in the economic system. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Peasant Insurance</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The form that this bargain took was the adoption of what anthropologists</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  social  historians  describe  as  the  “closed  vil age.”  Almost  every  peasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">society in premodern times had, as its main form of economic organization, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the “closed vil age.” Unlike more modern forms of economic organization, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  individuals  tend  to  deal  with  many  buyers  and  sel ers  in  an  open</p>
<p class="calibre1">market, the households of the closed vil age joined together to operate like an</p>
<p class="calibre1">informal corporation, or a large family, not in an open marketplace but in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed system where al  the economic transactions of the vil age tended to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">struck with a single monopolist&mdash;the local landlord, or his agents among the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vil age chiefs. The vil age as a whole would contract with the landlord, usual y</p>
<p class="calibre1">for payment in kind, for a high proportion of the crop, rather than a  xed</p>
<p class="calibre1">rent.  The  proportional  rent  meant  that  the  landlord  absorbed  part  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">downside risk of a bad harvest. Of course, the landlord also took the greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of the potential pro t. Landlords also typical y provided seed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This convention also minimized the danger of starvation. It required that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the landlord, rather than the peasant, save a disproportionate share of his part</p>
<p class="calibre1">89</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-73"></a>of the harvest. Because agricultural yields were appal ingly low in many areas</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the past, as many as two seeds had to be planted for every three harvested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  such  conditions,  a  bad  harvest  would  mean  mass  starvation.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">peasants  rational y  preferred  an  arrangement  which  would  require  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">landlord  to  invest  in  their  survival.  At  the  cost  of  buying  at  monopolized</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices,  sel ing  cheaply,  and  providing  the  landlord  with  in-kind  labor,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">peasants increased their chances of survival. A similar impulse led the typical</p>
<p class="calibre1">peasant in a closed vil age economy to forgo the security of freehold property</p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership.  By  putting  themselves  at  the  mercy  of  the  vil age  head-man,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">peasant  family  improved  its  chances  of  bene ting  from  the  regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution of  elds. Not infrequently, the headman would take the best</p>
<p class="calibre1">elds for himself and his favorites. But that was a risk that peasants had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tolerate  in  order  to  enjoy  the  survival  insurance  that  confused  vil age</p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership of  elds provided. At times when crop yields were miserably low, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erence in growing conditions of  elds a hundred yards apart could make</p>
<p class="calibre1">the di erence between starvation and survival. Peasants frequently opted for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the arrangement that lowered the downside risk, even at the cost of forgoing</p>
<p class="calibre1">any hope of increased prosperity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In general, risk-averse behavior has been common among al  groups that</p>
<p class="calibre1">operated  along  the  margins  of  survival.  The  sheer  chal enge  of  survival  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">premodern  societies  always  constrained  the  behavior  of  the  poor.  An</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting feature of this risk aversion, explored in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i>  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that it reduced the range of peaceful economic behavior that individuals were</p>
<p class="calibre1">social y  permitted  to  adopt.  Taboos  and  social  constraints  limited</p>
<p class="calibre1">experimentation  and  innovative  behavior,  even  at  the  obvious  cost  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgoing  potential y  advantageous  improvements  in  settled  ways  of  doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">things<a href="#calibre_link-6">.13  </a>This  was  a  rational  re ection  of  the  fact  that  experimentation increases  the  variability  of  results.  Greater  variability  means  not  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential y greater gains but&mdash;more ominously for those at the very margin</p>
<p class="calibre1">of survival&mdash;potential y ruinous losses. A great part of the cultural energy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor  farming  societies  has  always  been  devoted  to  suppressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">experimentation. This repression, in e ect, was their substitute for insurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">policies.  If  they  had  insurance,  or  su cient  savings  to  self-insure  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments, such strong social taboos would not be needed to help ensure</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">90</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-312"></a>Cultures  are  not  matters  of  taste  but  systems  of  adaptation  to  speci c</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances that may prove irrelevant or even counterproductive in other</p>
<p class="calibre1">settings.  Humans  live  in  a  wide  variety  of  habitats.  The  wide  number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential niches in which we live require variations in behavior that are too</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex  to  be  informed  by  instinct.  Therefore,  behavior  is  cultural y</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmed.  For  the  vast  majority  in  many  agricultural  societies,  culture</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmed  them  for  survival,  but  little  more  than  survival  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment where the luxury of participating in open markets was reserved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personal ability and personal choice&mdash;individual “pursuit of happiness,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the modern sense&mdash;were suppressed by taboos and social restrictions that</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  always  been  most  emphatic  among  the  poor.  Such  restrictions  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">superseded  only  with  great  di culty  in  societies  with  limited  productivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  and  where  agricultural  productivity  was  higher,  such  as  in  ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greece,  minor  megapolitical  revolutions  occurred.  Property  took  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern forms. “Al od,” or freehold property, emerged. Lands tended to rent</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a  xed fee, and the tenant absorbed the economic risk as wel  as a higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion of the pro t if the crop was good. Higher savings al ow self-insurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of riskier behavior. Under such conditions, yeoman farmers could rise above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rank of peasantry and sometimes even accumulate independent wealth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  tendency  for  more  market-like  property  rights  and  relationships  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop near the top of an economic hierarchy or, in rarer cases, across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  economy,  as  societies  emerged  from  poverty,  is  an  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristic of social organization. It is equal y important to note that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  common  organization  of  agricultural  society  historical y  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential y  feudal,  with  market  relations  at  the  top  and  the  closed  vil age</p>
<p class="calibre1">system  at  the  bottom.  The  great  mass  of  peasants  were  tied  to  the  land  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  al   premodern  agricultural  societies.  So  long  as  agricultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity  remained  low,  or  higher  productivity  was  dependent  upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">access  to  centralized  hydraulic  systems,  the  freedom  and  property  rights  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual  farmers  at  the  bottom  remained  minimal.  In  such  conditions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">feudal  forms  of  property  prevailed.  Land  was  held  by  tenure  rather  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  freehold  title.  Typical y,  rights  of  sale,  gift,  and  inheritance  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">restricted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">91</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-74"></a>Feudalism in its various forms was not only a response to ever-present risks</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  predatory  violence.  It  also  was  a  reaction  to  appal ingly  low  rates  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity. The two have tended to go hand in hand in farming societies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each frequently contributed to the other. When public authority col apsed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">property  rights  and  prosperity  tended  to  recede  accordingly.  Col apsing</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity also tended to undermine authority. While not every drought or</p>
<p class="calibre1">adverse climatic change resulted in the breakdown of public authority, many</p>
<p class="calibre1">did. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE FEUDAL REVOLUTION OF THE YEAR 1000</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Such was the case with the transformation of the year 1000, which launched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the feudal revolution<a href="#calibre_link-6">.14</a> At that time, megapolitical and economic conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">di ered  in  important  ways  from  those  we  have  come  to  think  of  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">characterizing  the  Middle  Ages.  In  the  rst  few  centuries  after  the  fal   of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rome, the economy of Western Europe withered. The Germanic kingdoms</p>
<p class="calibre1">that took root in the territories of the former Roman Empire had assumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  functions  of  the  Roman  state,  but  at  a  much  less  ambitious  level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infrastructure more or less went untended. As the centuries passed, bridges</p>
<p class="calibre1">and aqueducts fel  into disrepair and became unusable. Roman coinage was</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil  employed, but it practical y disappeared from circulation. Land markets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which had thrived in Roman times, more or less dried up. Towns, which had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  centers  of  Roman  administration,  virtual y  vanished  along  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxing  power  of  the  state.  And  so  did  almost  every  other  accoutrement  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The “Dark Ages” were so named for a reason. Literacy became so rare that</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone who possessed the ability to read and write could expect immunity</p>
<p class="calibre1">from prosecution for almost any crime, including murder. Artistic, scienti c, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  engineering  skil s  that  had  been  highly  developed  in  Roman  times</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared.  From  road  building  to  the  grafting  of  vines  and  fruit  trees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Western Europe ceased employing many techniques that had once been wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">known  and  practiced  to  a  high  standard.  Even  so  ancient  a  device  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potter’s  wheel  disappeared  in  many  places.  Mining  operations  contracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metal urgy  receded.  Irrigation  works  in  the  Mediterranean  region</p>
<p class="calibre1">disintegrated through neglect<a href="#calibre_link-6">.15 </a>As historian Georges Duby observed, “At the</p>
<p class="calibre1">92</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-75"></a>end  of  the  sixth  century,  Europe  was  a  profoundly  uncivilized  place.” <a href="#calibre_link-6">16</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Although there was a brief renaissance of central authority under the rule of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charlemagne around the year 800, everything soon devolved again after his</p>
<p class="calibre1">death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  surprising  corol ary  to  this  dreary  landscape  was  the  fact  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse  of  the  Roman  state  probably  raised  the  living  standards  of  smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmers  for  several  centuries.  The  Germanic  kingdoms  that  dominated</p>
<p class="calibre1">Western  Europe  during  the  Dark  Ages  incorporated  some  of  the  relatively</p>
<p class="calibre1">easygoing social features common to their ancestral tribes, such as the legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">equality  of  freeholders.  As  a  consequence,  smal   farmers  in  the  Dark  Ages</p>
<p class="calibre1">were far freer than they were to be in the feudal centuries. By that we can also</p>
<p class="calibre1">infer that they were more prosperous. As we analyzed above in exploring the</p>
<p class="calibre1">logic of property forms under di erent conditions of productivity, freehold</p>
<p class="calibre1">property  has  historical y  gone  hand  in  hand  with  the  relative  prosperity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal   farmers.  The  closed-vil age  and  feudal  forms  of  property  tended  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerge  where  the  capacity  of  smal   farmers  to  make  a  living  was  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the virtual col apse of commerce during the Dark Ages cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal   farmers  the  bene ts  of  trade  and  advantages  of  wider  markets.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">demise  of  the  towns  undermined  the  cash  economy,  but  it  also  meant  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rural population was no longer cal ed upon to support the crushing burden</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  bureaucracy.  As  Guy  Bois  has  written,  the  Roman  town  was  a  parasitic</p>
<p class="calibre1">community,  not  a  center  of  production:  “In  the  Roman  period,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominant function of a city was of a political order. It lived primarily from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the revenues draining into it from its surroundings by the agency of the land</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax.… The town, in e ect, produced little or nothing for the bene t of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding countryside.” <a href="#calibre_link-6">17</a> The col apse of Roman authority largely freed</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmers in the countryside from taxes, which had sucked away “between one</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter to one third of the gross product of the land, without counting the</p>
<p class="calibre1">various  exactions  su ered  by  smal   and  middling  landowners. <a href="#calibre_link-6">”18</a>  The  taxes were so onerous, sometimes enforced by execution, that desertion of property</p>
<p class="calibre1">by owners was widespread. The barbarians merciful y al owed these taxes to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Agri Deserti</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">93</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-76"></a>The  burdens  of  government  were  so  greatly  reduced  by  the  barbarian</p>
<p class="calibre1">conquests  that  an  opening  was  created  for  the  poor  to  obtain  freehold</p>
<p class="calibre1">property and keep it. Some of the  <i class="calibre4">agri deserti, </i> or deserted farms abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">by owners  eeing predatory taxation in the  nal years of the Roman Empire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  brought  back  into  production.  Notwithstanding  the  rude</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances of the time and the fact that crop yields were ridiculously low</p>
<p class="calibre1">by modern standards, the Dark Ages were a period of relative prosperity for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe’s  smal holders.  In  fact,  they  were  in  a  stronger  position  than  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  again  until  the  modern  era.  For  one  thing,  fewer  hands  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">available  to  til   the  fertile  land,  large  tracts  of  which  had  gone  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultivation.  Plagues,  wars,  and  abandonment  by  owners  escaping  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apsing  Roman  Empire  had  signi cantly  depopulated  areas  previously</p>
<p class="calibre1">under cultivation. Another advantage enjoyed by smal  farmers in the Dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ages  arose  from  the  adoption  in  the  sixth  century  of  new  farming</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology: the heavy plow, often mounted on wheels. Used in tandem with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an improved harness that al owed peasants to employ multiple oxen, the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology made it much easier to clear forested land in Northern Europe. <a href="#calibre_link-6">19</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  such  conditions,  the  market  for  land  contracted  almost  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanishing point. New land for farming could be had merely by clearing it and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharing part of each new parcel with the appropriate local authorities. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">process, known as  <i class="calibre4">assarting, </i> gave a comfortable outlet for population growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  centuries  after  Rome  fel .  Assarting  became  particularly  attractive  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinly populated northern regions after warmer temperatures in the eighth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century made farming more productive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leaders  of  the  Germanic  tribes  who  conquered  former  Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">territories had established themselves as large landholders. Most of the rest of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the population farmed smal  plots&mdash;but under conditions very di erent from</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  that  came  later  under  feudalism.  Wealthier  landowners,  or   <i class="calibre4">masters, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">represented about 7-10 percent of the population. It appears that before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year 1000, two-thirds of the vil agers in a typical area of France were freehold</p>
<p class="calibre1">landowners. <a href="#calibre_link-6">20</a> They owned about half of al  the land in cultivation. <a href="#calibre_link-6">21</a> There were  few  serfs.  <i class="calibre4">Coloni, </i>  or  tenant  farmers,  amounted  to  no  more  than  5</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the population. Slavery persisted, but on a much smal er scale than</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Roman times. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-77"></a>The Germanic successor kingdoms to Rome were defended militarily by</p>

<p class="calibre1">As the Dark Ages wore on, however, several things happened to destabilize</p>
<p class="calibre1">the relationships that had preserved the independence of the yeoman farmers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and freeholders in the Germanic kingdoms that inherited power after Rome’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal :1. Populations gradualy recovered, placing greater pressures on the use of</p>
<p class="calibre1">land. Over several centuries, much of the most fertile of the unclaimed land</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  brought  into  production,  engendering  growth  in  Northern  Europe  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular. The increasing population of farmers relative to the supply of land</p>
<p class="calibre1">made the labor of each farmer worth less. Most freehold titles were broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">into ever smal er plots through inheritance. During the Dark Ages, children</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended to share equal y in the estates of their parents. The fragmentation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">holdings  at  a  time  of  rising  population  tended  to  place  land  at  a  premium</p>
<p class="calibre1">once  again  and  led  to  the  re-emergence  of  active  land  markets  by  the  mid-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. In the  nal decades of the tenth century, temperatures suddenly turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">colder,  with  a  devastating  impact  on  farm  output.  Three  successive  crop</p>
<p class="calibre1">failures  led  to  severe  famine  from  982  to  984.  Famine  struck  again  after</p>
<p class="calibre1">95</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-78"></a>another crop failure in 994<a href="#calibre_link-6">.25 </a>Then, in 997, the problem of fal ing crop yields was  compounded  by  a  plague,  which  struck  smal   family  holdings  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular force because the smal holders lacked the resources to replace labor</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplied by lost family members. These clustered crop failures and disasters at</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst led the yeoman farmers to sink into debt. When yields failed to recover</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could not pay their mortgages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  Power  relations  were  progressively  destabilized  by  the  growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  heavy  cavalry.  Medieval  historian  Frances  Gies  describes  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformation of the armored cavalryman into the medieval knight:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Original y a personality of mediocre status raised above the peasant by his</p>
<p class="calibre1">expensive horse and armor, the knight slowly improved his position in society</p>
<p class="calibre1">until  he  became  part  of  the  nobility.  Although  knights  remained  the  lowest</p>
<p class="calibre1">rank  of  the  upper  class,  knighthood  acquired  a  unique  cachet  that  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">knighting an honor prized by the great nobility and even royalty. The cachet</p>
<p class="calibre1">was primarily the product of the Church’s policy of Christianizing knighthood</p>
<p class="calibre1">by sanctifying the ceremony of knighting and by sponsoring a code of behavior</p>
<p class="calibre1">known  as  chivalry,  a  code  perhaps  violated  more  often  than  honored,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercising incontestable in uence on the thought and conduct of posterity. <a href="#calibre_link-6">26</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As we recounted in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i> the invention of the stirrup gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">the armed knight on horseback a formidable assault capability. He could now</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack at ful  speed and not be thrown from the saddle by the impact of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">lance  striking  a  target.  The  military  value  of  the  heavy  cavalry  was  further</p>
<p class="calibre1">enhanced by an Asian, invention that penetrated through Western Europe in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  tenth  century;  the  nailed  iron  horseshoe.  This  further  improved  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">durability  of  the  horse  on  the  road<a href="#calibre_link-6">.27  </a>Also  adding  to  the  improved</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ectiveness of the armed knight were the contoured saddle, which made it</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier to wield heavy weapons, the spur, and the curb bit, which enabled a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rider  to  control  the  horse  with  one  hand  while  ghting<a href="#calibre_link-6">.28  </a>Together,  these apparently  minor  technological  innovations  dramatical y  devalued  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">military importance of the smal holders, who could not a ord to maintain</p>
<p class="calibre1">war-horses and arm themselves. The cheaper of the horses special y bred for</p>
<p class="calibre1">war,  the  large  chargers  known  as   <i class="calibre4">destriers, </i>  were  worth  four  oxen  or  forty</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheep.  The  more  expensive  warhorses  cost  ten  oxen  or  one  hundred  sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">96</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-79"></a>Armor also cost a sum that no smal  holder could a ord, equivalent to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">price of sixty sheep<a href="#calibre_link-6">.29</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  The  fact  that  the  colder  weather,  crop  failures,  famines,  and  plagues</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred during the run-up to the year 1000 also played a role in informing</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior.  Many  people  were  convinced  that  the  end  of  the  world  or  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Second  Coming  was  at  hand.  Devout  or  frightened  landowners,  large  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal , gave their land to the Church in preparation for apocalypse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Only a Poor Man Sells Land” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  unsettled  conditions  of  the  late  tenth  century  paved  the  way  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feudal  revolution.  Clustered  crop  failures  and  disasters  led  the  yeoman</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmers to sink into debt. When crop yields failed to recover, the freeholders</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced a desperate situation. Markets always place the greatest pressures on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakest holders. Indeed, that is part of their virtue. They promote e ciency</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  removing  assets  from  weak  hands.  But  in  late-tenth-century  Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">subsistence  farming  was  practical y  the  only  occupation.  Families  who  lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  land  lost  their  only  means  of  survival.  Faced  with  this  unpalatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">prospect,  many  or  most  of  the  freehold  farmers  decided  to  give  away  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">elds during the feudal revolution. In the words of Guy Bois, “The only sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">way for a peasant to hold on to the land he til ed was to concede ownership of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it to the Church, so he could retain its usufruct. <a href="#calibre_link-6">”30</a> Others ceded some or al</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  their  land  to  wealthier  farmers  in  whom  they  had  con dence,  either</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendly neighbors or relatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These property transfers were made on the condition that the farmer, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">family,  and  his  descendants  were  to  remain  to  work  the  elds.  The  poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmers  were  also  to  enjoy  the  reciprocal  support  of  the  more  substantial</p>
<p class="calibre1">holders, now the “nobles” who were able to a ord horse and armor, and thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide protection to the enlarged estates. Such a bargain can be seen from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  serf’s  point  of  view  as  a  halfway  station  between  continuing</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic ownership and foreclosure. More often than not, it was a bargain</p>
<p class="calibre1">he could not refuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fal ing productivity not only placed poor farmers in a desperate economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">dilemma; it also instigated an upsurge in predatory violence that undermined</p>
<p class="calibre1">the security of property. Those without the resources to wrest a share of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">97</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-80"></a>available  and  inadequate  supply  of  horses  and  fodder  suddenly  found  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  and  their  property  were  no  longer  safe.  To  put  their  dilemma  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemporary terms, it was as if you were forced to arm yourself today with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new type of weapon, but the cost of doing so was $100,000. If you could not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay that price, you would be at the mercy of those who could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a few years, the capacity of the king and the courts to enforce order</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apsed. <a href="#calibre_link-6">31</a> Anyone with armor and a horse could now become a law unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. The result was a late-tenth-century version of  <i class="calibre4">Blade Runner, </i> a melee</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  ghting  and  plunder  that  the  constituted  authorities  were  powerless  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop. Looting and attacks by armed knights disrupted the countryside. It is by</p>
<p class="calibre1">no means obvious, however, that al  the victims of this pil age were the poor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  the  contrary,  the  elderly,  physical y  weaker,  or  il -prepared  among  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger landholders made more attractive targets. They had more to steal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  not  a  coincidence  that  this  happened  at  the  very  moment  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">colder weather, famine, and plague were placing a pinch on resources. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical conditions conducive to the breakdown of authority had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  place  for  some  time.  Their  potential  for  altering  the  power  relations  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">society was not realized, however, until a crisis was triggered. Crop failures</p>
<p class="calibre1">and famines appear to have done just that. While the exact sequence of events</p>
<p class="calibre1">is di cult to reconstruct, it appears that the looting was instigated, at least in</p>
<p class="calibre1">part,  by  desperate  conditions.  Once  the  violence  was  unleashed,  it  became</p>
<p class="calibre1">evident that no one could mobilize the force to stop it. The vast majority of</p>
<p class="calibre1">poorly armed farmers certainly could do little. Even dozens of farmers on foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  been  outmatched  by  a  single  armed  knight  on  horseback.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">freehold farmers, like the constituted authorities, the kings with their counts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were powerless to prevent local land from being seized by armed warriors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“The Peace of God” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  these  desperate  conditions,  the  Church  helped  to  launch  feudalism</p>
<p class="calibre1">through its e orts to negotiate a truce in the violent countryside. Historian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Guy Bois described the situation this way: “The impotence of the political</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  was  such  that  the  Church  stood  in  for  them  in  the  attempt  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">restore order, in the movement known as ‘The Peace of God.’ ‘Councils of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peace’  proclaimed  series  of  interdictions  which  were  sanctioned  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">98</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-81"></a>anathemas; vast ‘assemblies of peace’ received the oaths of the warriors. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement  originated  in  the  French  Midi  (Council  of  Charroux  in  989, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Council of Narbonne in 990), then gradual y spread.…<a href="#calibre_link-6">”32</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  bargain  that  the  Church  struck  involved  acknowledgment  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">overlordship  of  armed  knights  in  local  communities  in  exchange  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cessation or tempering of the violence and looting. Land titles inscribed after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the surge of violence in the late tenth century suddenly bore the title “nobilis” </p>
<p class="calibre1">or “miles” as an indication of lordship. The nobility as a separate estate was</p>
<p class="calibre1">created by the feudal revolution. Property transactions recorded to the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals only a few years earlier had listed no such distinction<a href="#calibre_link-6">.33</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Given  fal ing  productivity  and  the  economic  insecurity  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal holders, the megapolitical power of the armed knights led inevitably to</p>
<p class="calibre1">property  holdings  by  feudal  tenure.  By  the  end  of  the  rst  quarter  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eleventh century, yeoman farmers had largely disappeared. Their freeholdings</p>
<p class="calibre1">had shrunk to a fraction of their previous extent and were now being worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">just part-time. The smal  farmers or their descendants were serfs who spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  of  their  time  laboring  on  the  estates  of  feudal  lords,  lay  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ecclesiastical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  breakdown  of  order  that  accompanied  the  feudal  revolution  led  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjustments  in  behavior  which  reinforced  feudalism.  Among  them  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">surge  in  castle  building.  Castles  had  rst  appeared  in  northwest  Europe  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive wooden structures in the wake of Viking raids in the ninth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Original y command centers for Carolingian o cials, they became hereditary</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessions after the feudal revolution. These early redoubts were far more</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive than they would later become, but they were nonetheless di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">to attack. Once erected, castles were razed only with the greatest e ort. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">they began to dot the countryside, the castles made it ever more implausible</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the king or his counts could e ectively chal enge the local supremacy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lords. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Contributions of the Church to Productivity</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Feudalism was the response of agricultural society to the col apse of order at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">time of low productivity. During the early stages of feudalism, the Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">99</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-82"></a>played an important and economical y productive role. Among the Church’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">contributions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. In an environment where military power was decentralized, the Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  uniquely  placed  to  maintain  peace  and  develop  rules  of  order  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcended  fragmented,  local  sovereignties.  This  is  a  job  that  no  secular</p>
<p class="calibre1">power was positioned to do. The observations of the great religious authority</p>
<p class="calibre1">A. R. Radcli e-Brown are directly relevant here. He pointed out that “the</p>
<p class="calibre1">social function of a religion is independent of its truth or falsity.” Even those</p>
<p class="calibre1">that are “absurd and repulsive, such as those of some savage tribes, may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">important and e ective parts of the social machinery. <a href="#calibre_link-6">”34</a> This was certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  case  with  the  Church  in  the  early  stages  of  feudalism.  It  helped  create</p>
<p class="calibre1">rules, as only a religion could, that enabled people to overcome incentive traps</p>
<p class="calibre1">and behavioral dilemmas. Some of these were moral dilemmas common to al</p>
<p class="calibre1">human  life.  But  others  were  local  dilemmas,  unique  to  the  prevailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical conditions. The medieval Church had a special role to play in</p>
<p class="calibre1">restoring order in the countryside in the  nal years of the tenth century. By</p>
<p class="calibre1">providing religious and ceremonial support to local authorities, the Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowered the costs of establishing at least weak local monopolies of violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  helping  to  establish  order  in  this  way,  the  Church  contributed  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions that ultimately led to more stable con gurations of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Church  continued  to  play  a  role  for  a  long  time  thereafter  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempering the private wars and excesses of violence that otherwise could not</p>
<p class="calibre1">be contained by civil authorities. The relative importance of the Church as</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposed  to  secular  authorities  is  re ected  in  the  fact  that  by  the  eleventh</p>
<p class="calibre1">century,  the  main  administrative  division  of  authority  in  most  of  Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe came to be the parish, rather than the old divisions of civil authority, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  <i class="calibre4">ager</i> and  <i class="calibre4">pagus</i> (town) that had persisted from Roman times through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark Ages<a href="#calibre_link-6">.35</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  The  Church  was  the  main  source  for  preserving  and  transmitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">technical  knowledge  and  information.  The  Church  sponsored  universities</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  provided  the  minimal  education  that  medieval  society  enjoyed.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church also provided a mechanism for reproducing books and manuscripts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including  almost  al   contemporary  information  about  farming  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">husbandry. The  <i class="calibre4">scriptoria</i> of the Benedictine monasteries can be understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">as an alternate technology to printing presses, which did not yet exist. Costly</p>
<p class="calibre1">100</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-83"></a>and  ine cient  as  the  scriptoria  were,  they  were  practical y  the  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism for reproducing and preserving written knowledge in the feudal</p>
<p class="calibre1">period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Partly because its farm managers were literate, the Church did a great</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal to help improve the productivity of European farming, especial y in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early stages of feudalism. Before the thirteenth century the farm managers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay lords were almost al  il iterates who kept records through an elaborate set</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  marks.  Shrewd  farmers  though  they  may  have  been,  they  were  in  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">position to bene t from any improvement in production methods that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  not  invent  themselves  or  see  with  their  own  eyes.  The  Church  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore  essential  to  improving  the  quality  of  grains,  fruits,  and  breeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">stock.  Because  of  its  extensive  holdings  spread  over  the  entire  European</p>
<p class="calibre1">continent,  the  Church  could  send  the  most  productive  seed  and  breeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">stock  to  areas  where  output  lagged.  The  demand  for  sacramental  wine  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Northern  Europe  led  monks  to  experiment  with  hardier  varieties  of  grape</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  could  survive  in  colder  climates.  The  Church  also  helped  raise  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity of medieval farming in other ways. Many of the uneconomical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal   plots  donated  to  the  Church  during  the  feudal  revolution  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">recon gured  to  make  them  easier  to  farm.  The  Church  also  provided</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancil ary  services  required  by  smal   farming  communities.  In  many  areas, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Church-owned mil s ground grain into  our. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  The  Church  undertook  many  functions  that  are  today  absorbed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">government, including the provision of public infrastructure. This is part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  way  that  the  Church  helped  overcome  what  economists  cal   “public</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods dilemmas” in an era of fragmented authority. Speci c religious orders</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  early-medieval  Church  devoted  themselves  to  applied  engineering</p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks, like opening roads, rebuilding fal en bridges, and repairing dilapidated</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roman aqueducts. They also cleared land, built dams, and drained swamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  new  monastic  order,  the  Carthusians,  dug  the  rst  “artesian”  wel   in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artois, France. Using percussion dril ing, they dug a smal  hole deep enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to create a wel  that needed no pump. <a href="#calibre_link-6">36</a> The Cistercian Order undertook to</p>
<p class="calibre1">build  and  maintain  precarious  seawal s  and  dikes  in  the  Low  Countries  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.  Farmers  deeded  land  to  Cistercian  monasteries  and  then  leased  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">back, while the monks undertook ful  responsibility for upkeep and repairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cistercians also took the lead in developing water-powered machines, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">101</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-84"></a>were  adopted  to  such  widespread  uses  as  “pounding,  lifting,  grinding,  and pressing.” <a href="#calibre_link-6">37 </a>The monastery of Clairvaux dug a two-mile-long canal from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">River Aube. <a href="#calibre_link-6">38 </a>The Church also intervened to build new roads and bridges</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  population  centers  had  shifted  outside  the  range  of  the  old  Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">garrison roads. Bishops granted indulgences to local lords who would build</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  repair  river  crossings  and  maintain  hospices  for  travelers.  An  order  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">monks  established  by  St.  Bénezet,  the  Frères  Pontifes,  or  “Brothers  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bridge,” built several of the longest bridges then existing, including the Pont</p>
<p class="calibre1">d’Avignon,  a  massive  twenty-arch  structure  over  the  Rhone  with  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">combination chapel and tol booth at one end. Even London Bridge, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood  until  the  nineteenth  century,  was  constructed  by  a  chaplain  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanced in part by a contribution of 1,000 marks from the papal legate. <a href="#calibre_link-6">39</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">5. The Church also helped incubate a more complex market. Cathedral</p>
<p class="calibre1">construction,  for  example,  di ers  in  kind  from  public  infrastructure,  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridges  and  aqueducts.  In  principle,  at  least,  Church  structures  were  used</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  for  religious  services  and  not  as  thoroughfares  for  commerce.  Yet  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">should not be forgotten that construction of churches and cathedrals helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">create and deepen markets for many artisanal and engineering skil s. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same  way  that  military  spending  of  the  nation-state  during  the  Cold  War</p>
<p class="calibre1">unintentional y  helped  incubate  the  Internet,  so  the  building  of  medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">cathedrals led to spin-o s of other kinds, the incubation of commerce. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church was a principal customer of the building trades and artisans. Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchases  of  silver  for  communion  services,  candelabra,  and  artworks  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decorate churches helped to create a market for luxury goods that otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not have existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  many  ways,  the  Church  helped  to  temper  the  ferocity  of  violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">unleashed  by  armed  knights  during  and  after  the  “feudal  revolution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especial y  in  the  early  centuries  of  feudalism,  the  Church  contributed</p>
<p class="calibre1">signi cantly to improving the productivity of the farming economy. It was an</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential institution, wel   tted to the needs of agrarian society at the close of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Dark Ages. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Vulnerability to Violence</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">102</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-85"></a>In “[t]hirty or forty years of violent disturbances, the feudal revolution of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">year 1000,” <a href="#calibre_link-6">40 </a>like the fal  of Rome  ve centuries earlier, was a unique event, </p>
<p class="calibre1">caused by a complex interplay of in uences. Yet in one respect, the triumph</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  <i class="calibre4">mali homines</i> (wicked men) and the oppressions they wrought perfectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">re ect  the  essential  vulnerability  of  agricultural  society  to  violence.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrast  to  the  foraging  phase  of  human  existence,  farming  introduced  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">quantum leap in organized violence and oppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the very earliest, this was re ected in the more militant cultures of</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming  peoples.  The  gods  of  the  early  agricultural  societies  were  gods  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rainfal  and  ooding, whose functions re ected the preoccupations of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies with factors that determined crop yields. The sender of rain or water</p>
<p class="calibre1">was also often the god of war, invoked by the earliest kings, who were, above</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  else, warlords<a href="#calibre_link-6">.41</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  close  connection  between  farming  and  warfare  was  re ected  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  imagination  of  people  whose  lives  were  transformed  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">innovations of the agricultural revolution. The expulsion from the Garden of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden can be seen as a  gurative account of the transformation of society from</p>
<p class="calibre1">foraging to farming, from a free life with food picked from nature’s bounty</p>
<p class="calibre1">with little work to a life of hard labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PARADISE LOST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Farming  set  humanity  on  an  entirely  new  course.  The  rst  farmers  truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">planted  the  seeds  of  civilization.  From  their  toil  came  cities,  armies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">arithmetic, astronomy, dungeons, wine and whiskey, the written word, kings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slavery, and war. Yet notwithstanding al  the drama that farming was to add</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  life,  the  shift  away  from  the  primeval  economy  appears  to  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">roundly unpopular from its earliest days. Witness the account preserved in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Book of Genesis, which tel s the story of the expulsion from paradise. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">biblical parable of the Garden of Eden is a fond recol ection of the life of ease</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed  by  the  forager  in  the  wilderness.  Scholars  indicate  that  the  word</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eden” appears to be derived from a Sumerian word for “wilderness.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">42</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  transition  from  a  free  and  sparsely  settled  life  in  the  wild  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sedentary life in a farming vil age was a matter of deep regret, expressed not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only in the Bible but also in humankind’s continuing grudge against getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">103</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-86"></a>up in the morning and going to work. As Stephen Boyden wrote in  <i class="calibre4">Western</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Civilization in Biological Perspective, </i> the new way of living that accompanied</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming  was  “evodeviant.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">43  </a>Prior  to  the  advent  of  farming,  thousands  of human generations lived as Adam did in Eden, at the invitation of his Maker:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.” Hunters and gatherers</p>
<p class="calibre1">had no crops to tend, no herd to watch, no taxes to pay. Like hoboes, foragers</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted where they pleased, worked little, and answered to no one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With farming, a new way of life began, and on altogether more pressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms. “Thorns also and thistles shal  it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat</p>
<p class="calibre1">the herb of the  eld; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” Farming</p>
<p class="calibre1">was hard work. The memory of life before farming was that of paradise lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than they could have imagined, farmers created new conditions that</p>
<p class="calibre1">drastical y altered the logic of violence. It is not a coincidence that the Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Genesis makes Cain, the  rst murderer, “a til er of the ground.” Indeed, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  part  of  the  uncanny  prophetic  power  of  the  Bible  that  its  story  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrusted to shepherds who readily understood how farming gave leverage to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence.  In  a  few  verses  the  biblical  account  encapsulates  logic  that  took</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands  of  years  to  play  out.  Farming  was  an  incubator  of  disputes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farming  created  stationary  capital  on  an  extensive  scale,  raising  the  payo</p>
<p class="calibre1">from violence and dramatical y increasing the chal enge of protecting assets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farming made both crime and government paying propositions for the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;ARTHUR C. CLARKE</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  speak  of  the  coming  death  of  politics  is  bound  to  seem  ridiculous  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic, depending on your disposition. Yet that is what the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution  is  likely  to  bring.  For  readers  reared  in  a  century  saturated  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics,  the  idea  that  life  could  proceed  without  it  may  seem  fanciful,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent to claiming that one could live merely by absorbing nutrients from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  air.  Yet  politics  in  the  modern  sense,  as  the  preoccupation  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ing  and  rationalizing  the  power  of  the  state,  is  mostly  a  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">invention. We believe it wil  end with the modern world just as the tangle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">feudal duties and obligations that engrossed the attentions of people in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Middle  Ages  ended  with  the  Middle  Ages.  During  the  feudal  period,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">historian  Martin  van  Creveld  points  out,  “politics  did  not  exist  (the  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">concept  had  yet  to  be  invented,  and  dates  back  only  to  the  sixteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century).” <a href="#calibre_link-7">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The thought that politics, as we now know it, did not exist prior to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern  period  may  seem  surprising,  especial y  given  that  Aristotle  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">105</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-88"></a>written  an  essay  of  that  title  in  the  days  of  Alexander  the  Great.  But  look closely.  Words  used  in  ancient  texts  are  not  necessarily  contemporary</p>
<p class="calibre1">concepts. Aristotle also wrote an essay entitled  <i class="calibre4">Sophistical Refutations, </i> a term</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  as  meaningless  today  as   <i class="calibre4">Politics</i>  was  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The  word</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply was not in use. Its  rst known appearance in English dates to 1529. <a href="#calibre_link-7">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even then, “politics” appears to have been a pejorative, derived from an Old</p>
<p class="calibre1">French word,  <i class="calibre4">politique, </i> used to describe “opportunists and temporizers. <a href="#calibre_link-7">”4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It took almost two thousand years for Aristotle’s latent concept to emerge</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the meaning we now know. Why? Before the modern world could put</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aristotle’s word to a meaningful use, megapolitical conditions were required</p>
<p class="calibre1">that dramatical y raised the returns to violence. The Gunpowder Revolution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which we analyzed in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i> did just that. It raised the returns</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  violence  far  above  what  they  had  ever  been.  This  made  the  question  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">who control ed the state more important than it had ever been. Logical y and</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably, politics emerged from the struggle to control the sharply increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoils of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Politics  began  ve  centuries  ago  with  the  early  stages  of  industrialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  it  is  dying.  A  widespread  revulsion  against  politics  and  politicians  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweeping the world. You see it in news and speculation on the hidden details</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Whitewater, and the poorly disguised murder of Vincent Foster. You see it</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  numerous  other  scandals  touching  President  Bil   Clinton.  You  see  in  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">reports  of  embezzlement  by  leading  congressmen  from  the  House  Post</p>
<p class="calibre1">O ce. You see it in scandals leading to resignations in John Major’s circle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and similar scandals in France, reaching two recent prime ministers, Eduard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bal adur  and  Alain  Juppe.  Even  larger  scandals  have  been  revealed  in  Italy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where-seven-time prime minister Giulio Andreotti was brought to the dock</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  stand  trail  on  charges  that  included  links  to  the  Ma a  and  ordering  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">murder of Mino Pecorel i, an investigative journalist. Stil  other scandals have</p>
<p class="calibre1">tarnished  the  reputation  of  Spanish  prime  minister  Filipe  Gonzales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corruption al egations cost four Japanese prime ministers their jobs in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">kickbacks  on  a  C$1.8  bil ion  sale  of  Airbus  planes  to  Air  Canada<a href="#calibre_link-7">.5</a>  Wil y Claes, the secretary-general of NATO, was forced to resign under a cloud of</p>

<p class="calibre1">106</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-89"></a>minister and presumptive prime minister, was forced to resign in the face of</p>
<p class="calibre1">al egations  that  she  used  government  credit  cards  to  purchase  diapers  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  household  goods.  Almost  everywhere  you  turn  in  countries  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">mature  welfare  states  once  thought  of  as  wel   governed,  people  hate  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">political leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Disdain as a Leading Indicator</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Moral  outrage  against  corrupt  leaders  is  not  an  isolated  historical</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomenon but a common precursor of change. It happens again and again</p>
<p class="calibre1">whenever one era gives way to another. Whenever technological change has</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorced the old forms from the new moving forces of the economy, moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards  shift,  and  people  begin  to  treat  those  in  command  of  the  old</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions  with  growing  disdain.  This  widespread  revulsion  comes  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence wel  before people develop a new coherent ideology of change. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">we  write,  there  is  as  yet  little  evidence  of  an  articulate  rejection  of  politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That wil  come later. It has not yet occurred to most of your contemporaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a life without politics is possible. What we have in the  nal years of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century is inarticulate disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something similar happened in the late  fteenth century, but at that time</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was religion rather than politics that was in the process of being downsized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding popular belief in “the sacredness of the sacerdotal o ce, <a href="#calibre_link-7">”6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">both the higher and lower ranks of clergy were held in the utmost contempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;not unlike the popular attitude toward politicians and bureaucrats today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was widely believed that the upper clergy were corrupt, worldly, and venal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  not  without  reason.  Several  fteenth-century  popes  openly  sported</p>
<p class="calibre1">bastards. The lower clergy were held in even lower esteem as they proliferated</p>
<p class="calibre1">in country and town, begging for alms and frequently o ering to sel  God’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">grace  and  the  forgiveness  of  sins  to  anyone  who  would  put  cash  into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bargain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath  the  “crust  of  super cial  piety<a href="#calibre_link-7">”7  </a>was  a  corrupt  and  increasingly dysfunctional  system.  Many  lost  respect  for  those  who  ran  it,  long  before</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone  dared  to  say  that  it  did  not  work.  A  life  saturated  with  religion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">making no distinction between the spiritual and the temporal, had exhausted</p>
<p class="calibre1">107</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-314"></a>its possibilities. Its end was inevitable long before Luther nailed his 95 theses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the church door at Wittenberg. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A SECULAR REFORMATION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that the reaction against saturation politics is fol owing a similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">path. The death of the Soviet Union and the repudiation of socialism are part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a broad pattern of depoliticization sweeping the world. This is now most</p>
<p class="calibre1">evident in a growing contempt for those who run the world’s governments. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is driven only in part by the realization that they are corrupt, and prone to sel</p>
<p class="calibre1">“indulgences”  from  political  di culty  in  exchange  for  campaign</p>
<p class="calibre1">contributions or special help on commodity trades to subvene their personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">nances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reaction  against  politicians  is  also  motivated  by  the  widening</p>
<p class="calibre1">realization that much of what they do at great cost is futile, in the same way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  organizing  another  pilgrimage  of  penitents  to  march  barefoot  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">snow, or the founding of yet another order of mendicant monks in the late</p>
<p class="calibre1">fteenth  century,  could  have  done  little  to  improve  productivity  or  relieve</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressures on living standards. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Last Days of the Holy Mother Church</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the Middle Ages, the monolithic Church as an institution had</p>
<p class="calibre1">grown  senile  and  counterproductive,  a  marked  change  from  its  positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  contribution  ve  centuries  earlier.  As  we  explored  in  the  last</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapter, the Church played a leading role at the end of the tenth century in</p>
<p class="calibre1">establishing order and facilitating economic recovery from the anarchy that</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked  the  close  of  the  Dark  Ages.  At  that  time,  the  Church  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">indispensable to the survival of large numbers of smal  freeholders and serfs</p>
<p class="calibre1">who made up the bulk of the Western European population. By the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  fteenth  century,  the  Church  had  become  a  major  drag  upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity.  The  burdens  it  imposed  upon  the  population  were  pushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">living standards down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much  the  same  thing  can  be  said  of  the  nation-state  today.  It  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary  adaptation  to  the  new  megapolitical  conditions  created  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">108</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-423"></a>Gunpowder  Revolution  ve  centuries  ago.  The  nation-state  widened  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scope of markets and displaced fragmented local authorities at a time when</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  encompassing  trading  areas  brought  large  returns.  The  fact  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchants almost everywhere in Europe spontaneously al ied themselves to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the monarch at the center as he maneuvered to consolidate authority is itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">tel ing evidence that the nation-state in its early form was good for business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It helped lift the burdens on commerce imposed by feudal landlords and local</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a world where returns to violence were high and rising, the nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a useful institution. But  ve centuries later, as this mil ennium draws to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">close, megapolitical conditions have changed. Returns to violence are fal ing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the nation-state, like the Church at the twilight of the Middle Ages, is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronism that has become a drag on growth and productivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  Church  then,  the  nation-state  today  has  exhausted  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities. It is bankrupt, an institution grown to a senile extreme. Like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church then, it has served as the dominant form of social organization for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ve centuries. Having outlived the conditions that brought it into existence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it is ripe for a fal . And fal  it wil . Technology is precipitating a revolution in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  exercise  of  power  that  wil   destroy  the  nation-state  just  as  assuredly  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">gunpowder weapons and the printing press destroyed the monopoly of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If our reasoning is correct, the nation-state wil  be replaced by new forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of sovereignty, some of them unique in history, some reminiscent of the city-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states and medieval merchant republics of the premodern world. What was</p>
<p class="calibre1">old  wil   be  new  after  the  year  2000.  And  what  was  unimaginable  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplace. As the scale of technology plunges, governments wil   nd that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they must compete like corporations for income, charging no more for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">services  than  they  are  worth  to  the  people  who  pay  for  them.  The  ful</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications of this change are al  but unimaginable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THIN AND NOW</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Something similar might have been said  ve hundred years ago, at the turn of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  fteenth  century.  Then  as  now,  Western  civilization  stood  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">threshold of a momentous transformation. Although almost no one knew it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">109</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-90"></a>medieval  society  was  dying.  Its  death  was  neither  widely  anticipated  nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood. Nonetheless, the prevailing mood was one of deep gloom. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is common at the end of an era, as conventional thinkers sense that things are</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal ing  apart,  that  “the  falcon  cannot  hear  the  falconer.”  Yet  their  mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">inertia  is  often  too  great  to  comprehend  the  implications  of  the  emerging</p>
<p class="calibre1">con gurations  of  power.  Medieval  historian  Johan  Huizinga  wrote  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waning days of the Middle Ages, “The chroniclers of the  fteenth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">have, nearly al , been the dupes of an absolute misappreciation of their times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of which the real moving forces escaped their attention.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Myths Betrayed</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Major  changes  in  the  underlying  dynamics  of  power  tend  to  confound</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventional  thinkers  because  they  expose  myths  that  rationalize  the  old</p>
<p class="calibre1">order but lack any real explanatory power. At the end of the Middle Ages, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, there was a particularly wide gap between the received myths and reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Huizinga said of the Europeans in the late  fteenth century, “Their whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">system of ideas was permeated by the  ction that chivalry ruled the world.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This has a close second in the contemporary assumption that it is ruled by</p>
<p class="calibre1">votes  and  popularity  contests.  Neither  proposition  stands  up  to  close</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrutiny.  Indeed,  the  idea  that  the  course  of  history  is  determined  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic tal ies of wishes is every bit as sil y as the medieval notion that it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined by an elaborated code of manners cal ed chivalry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  saying  so  borders  on  heresy  suggests  how  divorced</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventional thinking is from a realistic grasp of the dynamics of power in</p>
<p class="calibre1">late industrial society. It is an issue we examine closely in this book. In our</p>
<p class="calibre1">view, voting was an e ect rather than a cause of the megapolitical conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that brought forth the modern nation-state. Mass democracy and the concept</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  citizenship  ourished  as  the  nation-state  grew.  They  wil   falter  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state falters, causing every bit as much dismay in Washington as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">erosion of chivalry caused in the court of the duke of Burgundy  ve hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">years ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-91"></a>If you can understand how and why the importance of chivalric oaths faded</p>
<p class="calibre1">away with the transition to an industrial organization of society, you wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">better positioned to see how citizenship as we now know it could fade away in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Information  Age.  Both  served  a  similar  function.  They  facilitated  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise of power under two quite di erent sets of megapolitical conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feudal  oaths  prevailed  at  a  time  when  defensive  technology  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">paramount,  sovereignties  were  fragmented,  and  private  individuals  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">lesser  lords,  who  in  turn  drew  upon   <i class="calibre4">their</i>  vassals,  the  knights.  The  whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">chain of al egiance carried down the hierarchy to the person of the meanest</p>
<p class="calibre1">social standing who was considered worthy to bear arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Uniforms or Divergences? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike a modern army, a medieval army before the rise of citizenship did not</p>
<p class="calibre1">march  on  the  eld  of  battle  out tted  in  uniforms.  To  the  contrary,  each</p>
<p class="calibre1">retainer  or  vassal,  each  knight,  baronet,  or  lord  of  di erent  degree  had  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own  distinctive  livery  that  re ected  his  place  in  the  hierarchy.  Instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">uniforms,  there  were  divergences  that  emphasized  the  vertical  structure  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">society  in  which  each  station  was  di erent.  As  Huizinga  said,  medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">warriors  were  distinguished  by  “outward  signs  of…  divergences:  liveries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">colors, badges, party cries. <a href="#calibre_link-7">”10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor  were  wars  fought  only  by  governments  or  nations.  As  Martin  van</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creveld has pointed out, modern notions of war, as stylized by strategists like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carl  von  Clausewitz,  misrepresent  the  reality  of  premodern  con ict.  Van</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creveld writes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">For  a  thousand  years  after  the  fal   of  Rome,  armed  con ict  was  waged  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent  kinds  of  social  entities.  Among  them  were  barbarian  tribes,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church, feudal barons of every rank, free cities, even private individuals. Nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">were the “armies” of the period anything like those we know today; indeed, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">111</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-92"></a>di cult to  nd a word that wil  do them justice. War was waged by shoals of</p>
<p class="calibre1">retainers who donned military garb and fol owed their lord<a href="#calibre_link-7">.11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, it was obviously crucial to the lord that his retainers</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y  “donned  their  military  garb  and  fol owed.”  Hence  the  heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasis placed upon the chivalric oath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The honor of the medieval knight and the duty of the conscript soldier</p>
<p class="calibre1">served  paral el  functions.  The  medieval  man  was  bound  by  oaths  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals  and  the  Church  in  much  the  way  that  moderns  are  bound  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship to the nation-state. Violating an oath was the medieval equivalent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of treason. People in late-medieval times went to extremes to avoid violating</p>
<p class="calibre1">oaths, just as mil ions of modern citizens went to extremes in the World Wars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">charging machine-gun nests to ful l  their duties as citizens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  chivalry  and  citizenship  added  an  extra  dimension  to  the  simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">calculus  that  would  otherwise  deter  unindoctrinated  human  beings  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">going onto a battle eld and staying there when the going got rough. Chivalry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and citizenship both led people to kil  and to risk death. Only demanding and</p>
<p class="calibre1">exaggerated  values  that  are  strongly  reinforced  by  leading  institutions  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve that function. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Circumventing Cost-Benefit Analysis</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The success and survival of any system depends upon its capacity to marshal</p>
<p class="calibre1">military e ort in times of con ict and crisis. Obviously, the decision on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of a medieval knight or a private in the trenches in World War I to risk</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  life  in  battle  was  not  likely  to  be  informed  by  a  sober,  cost-bene t</p>
<p class="calibre1">calculation. Seldom are wars so easily fought, or do rewards for those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">bear  the  brunt  of  the  ghting  so  far  overshadow  the  possible  costs  that  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">army of economic optimizers could be recruited to rush out to the battle eld. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost every war and, indeed, most battles have moments in which the tide</p>
<p class="calibre1">could turn on a heartbeat. As students of military history are wel  aware, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erence between defeat and victory is often told by the valor, bravery, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ferocity with which individual soldiers take up their task. If the men doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ghting are not wil ing to die over a piece of ground that would not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth a  g once the battle stops, then they probably wil  not prevail against</p>
<p class="calibre1">an otherwise evenly matched foe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">112</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-93"></a>This has important implications. The more e ective sovereignties are in</p>
<p class="calibre1">limiting defections and encouraging military e ort, the more likely they are to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevail militarily. In warfare, the most useful value systems induce people to</p>
<p class="calibre1">behave  in  ways  that  short-term  rational  calculation  would  rule  out.  No</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization  could  mobilize  military  power  e ectively  if  the  individuals  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">sent into battle felt free to calculate where their own best advantage lay, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">join in the  ght or run away accordingly. If so, they would almost never  ght. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only under the most propitious circumstances, or the most desperate, would</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  rational  person  care  to  engage  in  a  potential y  lethal  battle  based  upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">short-term cost-bene t analysts. Perhaps  <i class="calibre4">Homo economicus</i> might  ght on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunny day, when the forces on his side were overwhelming, the enemy weak, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the potential rewards of battle enticing. Perhaps. He might also  ght if</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed into a corner by marauding cannibals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  those  are  extreme  circumstances.  What  of  the  more  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions of warfare, which are neither so attractive that they would pass the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrutiny of cost-bene t analysis nor so desperate that they a ord no way out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  here  that  concepts  like  chivalry  and  citizenship  are  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">contributors  to  the  successful  use  of  military  power.  Long  before  a  battle</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins, predominant organizations must convince individuals that upholding</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain duties to the lord, or the nation-state, are more important than life</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself. The myths and rationalizations that societies employ to encourage risk-</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking on the battle eld are a key part of their military prowess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  be  e ective,  these  myths  must  be  tailored  to  the  prevailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  conditions.  The  ction  that  chivalry  rules  the  world  means</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing  today,  especial y  in  a  city  like  New  York.  But  it  was  the  cherished</p>
<p class="calibre1">myth  of  feudalism.  It  justi ed  and  rationalized  the  ties  of  obligation  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound everyone under the domination of the Church and a warlike nobility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  a  time  when  private  wars  of  covetousness  were  commonplace<a href="#calibre_link-7">,12</a>  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise  of  power  and  the  very  survival  of  individuals  depended  upon  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil ingness  of  others  to  ful l   their  promises  of  military  service  under</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  of  duress.  It  was  obviously  crucial  that  those  promises  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">dependable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Before Nationality</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">113</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-94"></a>Unlike today, the concept of nationality played little or no role in establishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  in  the  Middle  Ages.  Monarchs,  as  wel   as  some  princes  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church  and  powerful  lords,  possessed  territories  by  private  right.  In  a  way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that has no modern analogy, these lords could sel  or give away territories or</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquire new ones by conveyance or marriage as wel  as by conquest. Today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you could hardly imagine the United States fal ing under the sovereignty of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">non-English-speaking  Portuguese  president  because  he  happened  to  marry</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  former  American  president’s  daughter.  Yet  something  similar  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplace in medieval Europe. Power passed by hereditary descent. Cities</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  countries  changed  sovereigns  the  way  that  antiques  change  owners.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  cases,  sovereigns  were  not  native  to  the  regions  in  which  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">properties lay. Sometimes they did not speak the local language, or spoke it</p>
<p class="calibre1">badly with heavy accents. But it made little di erence to the ties of personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">obligation whether a Spaniard was king of Athens, or an Austrian was king of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Corporate Sovereignty</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereignty  was  also  exercised  by  religious  corporations  like  the  Knights</p>
<p class="calibre1">Templar, the Knights of St. John, the Teutonic Knights, and the Knights of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malta.  While  the  Knights  of  Malta  stil   exist  and  as  we  write  are  poised  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recover  sovereignty  over  Fort  St.  Angelo  in  Malta,  such  hybrid  institutions</p>
<p class="calibre1">have had no modern counterparts. They combined religious, social, judicial, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  nancial activities with sovereignty over localities. <a href="#calibre_link-7">13</a> While they exercised territorial jurisdiction, they were almost the opposite of today’s governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">in that nationality played no role in the mobilization of their support or their</p>
<p class="calibre1">scheme  of  governance.  The  members  and  o cers  of  these  religious  orders</p>
<p class="calibre1">were drawn from al  parts of Christian Europe, or “Christendom,” as it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one thought it appropriate or necessary that those who ruled be drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the local populations. The mobilization of support in the fragmented</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval scheme of governance did not depend upon a national identity or</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty  to  the  state,  as  in  modern  times,  but  upon  personal  loyalty  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">customary ties that had to be upheld as a matter of personal honor. Oaths to</p>
<p class="calibre1">114</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-95"></a>uphold these duties could be sworn by anyone from anywhere provided he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was otherwise deemed worthy by his station in life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Vow</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chivalric  vows  bound  individuals  to  one  another  and  were  sworn  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">honor of those who were parties to them. As Huizinga wrote, “in making a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vow,  people  imposed  some  privation  upon  themselves  as  a  spur  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment  of  the  actions  they  were  pledged  to  perform.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">14</a>  So  much importance  was  placed  upon  honoring  vows  that  people  frequently  risked</p>
<p class="calibre1">death  or  su ered  serious  privations  in  order  to  avoid  breaking  their  vows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often,  the  oaths  themselves  bound  individuals  to  perform  as  matters  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">honor acts that would probably seem ludicrous to you and most readers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, the Knights of the Star swore an oath never to retire “more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  four  acres  from  the  battle eld,  through  which  rule  soon  afterwards</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than ninety of them lost their lives. <a href="#calibre_link-7">”15 </a>The prohibition on even tactical</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreat is irrational as a military strategy. But it was a common imperative of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the chivalric vows. Before the Battle of Agincourt, the king of England issued</p>
<p class="calibre1">an order that knights on patrol should remove their armor, on grounds that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  been  incompatible  with  their  honor  to  withdraw  from  enemy</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines  if  they  were  wearing  their  coat  armor.  It  so  happened  that  the  king</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself got lost and passed by the vil age that had been night quarters for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanguard of his army. Since he was wearing armor, his chivalric honor forbade</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to simply turn around when he discovered his mistake and return to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vil age. He spent the night in an exposed position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As sil y as this example seems, King Henry probably did not miscalculate</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  thinking  that  he  would  have  risked  more  in  trespassing  his  honor  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreating, and thus setting a demoralizing example for his entire army, than</p>
<p class="calibre1">he did by sleeping behind enemy lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  history  of  the  Middle  Ages  is  l ed  with  examples  of  prominent</p>
<p class="calibre1">people ful l ing pledges that would seem ridiculous to us. In many cases, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions proposed involved no objective connection to any bene t other than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vivid demonstration of the importance those undertaking them placed upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the vow itself. Among the common vows: to keep one eye closed, to eat and</p>
<p class="calibre1">115</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-96"></a>drink only when standing, and to become a self-imposed cripple by entering a</p>
<p class="calibre1">one-person chain gang. There was a widespread custom of wearing painful</p>
<p class="calibre1">foot irons. If today you saw someone struggling along the street in a heavy leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">iron, you would probably assume that he was insane, not that he was a man</p>
<p class="calibre1">of great virtue. Yet in the context of chivalry, wil ingly donning such a device</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a badge of honor. And there were many similar customs that would seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">equal y ludicrous today. As Huizinga describes it, many took a pledge “not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep in a bed on Saturday, not to take animal food on Friday, etc. One act of</p>
<p class="calibre1">asceticism  is  heaped  upon  another:  one  nobleman  promises  to  wear  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">armor, to drink no wine one day in every week, not to sleep in a bed, not to sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">down to meals, to wear the hair shirt <i class="calibre4">,” </i><a href="#calibre_link-7">16</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lent  survives  as  a  much  moderated  version  of  this  self-imposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">discomfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many enthusiasts for vows formed orders that placed particularly di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">privations  on  their  members  as  tests  of  honor.  The  Order  of  Galois  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Galoises, for example, dressed during summers in “furs and fur-lined hoods</p>
<p class="calibre1">and lighted a  re in the hearth, whereas in winter they were only al owed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wear a simple coat without fur; neither mantles, not hats, nor gloves, and had</p>
<p class="calibre1">only very light bed clothes.” As Huizinga reports, “It is not surprising that a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great many members died of cold.” <a href="#calibre_link-7">17. </a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Medieval  self-flagellation  was  a  grim  torture  which  people  inflicted  on</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">the medieval period. They were gestures of the seriousness with which vows</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Chivalry Yields to Citizenship</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chivalry  faded  away,  to  be  replaced  by  citizenship,  when  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  changed  and  the  military  purpose  of  the  vow  to  one’s  lord  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">antiquated. The world of gunpowder weapons and industrial armies involved</p>
<p class="calibre1">very di erent relations between the individuals who did the  ghting and their</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanders. Citizenship emerged when returns to violence were high and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising, and the state had vastly greater resources than the social entities that</p>
<p class="calibre1">waged war in the medieval period. Because of its great power and wealth, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state could strike a bargain directly with the mass of common soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">who fought in its uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  bargains  proved  to  be  far  cheaper  to  the  state  and  much  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">troublesome  than  attempts  to  assemble  military  forces  by  negotiating  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful  lords  and  local  notables,  each  of  whom  was  capable  of  resisting</p>
<p class="calibre1">117</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-98"></a>demands  that  ran  counter  to  his  interests  as  no  individual  citizen  in  the nation-state conceivably could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  explore  at  greater  depth  later,  citizenship  crucial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">depended upon the fact that no individual or smal  group of individuals was</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical y  capable  of  exercising  military  power  independently.  As</p>

<p class="calibre1">medieval equivalent of motorcycle gangs. The rules of manners and pretenses</p>
<p class="calibre1">of chivalry served more to temper their excesses than as a description of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way  they  real y  behaved.  Even  an  encyclopedic  account  of  the  rules  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">became far more costly than it had been during the medieval period. Before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Gunpowder  Revolution,  wars  had  normal y  been  fought  by  groups  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  that they could be levied over a smal  and poor territory. Gunpowder</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave a new advantage to  ghting on a larger scale. Only leaders with claims on</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich subjects could a ord to  eld e ective forces under the new conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  leaders  who  best  accommodated  the  growth  of  commerce,  usual y</p>
<p class="calibre1">monarchs who al ied themselves with the urban merchants, found that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed a competitive advantage on the battle eld. In van Creveld’s words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“thanks in part to the superior  nancial resources at their disposal, they could</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase  more  cannon  than  anybody  else  and  blast  the  opposition  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">Even  though  it  would  be  centuries  before  the  ful   logic  of  gunpowder</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons would be unleashed in the citizen armies of the French Revolution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an  early  hint  of  the  transformation  of  warfare  by  gunpowder  was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">adoption  of  military  uniforms  in  the  Renaissance.  The  uniforms  aptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">symbolize  the  new  relations  between  the  warrior  and  the  nation-state  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">went hand in hand with the transition from chivalry to citizenship. In e ect, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  nation-state  would  strike  a  “uniform”  bargain  with  its  citizens, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unlike the special, divergent bargains struck by the monarch or the pope with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  long  chain  of  vassals  under  feudalism.  In  the  old  system,  everyone  had  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">Gunpowder  weapons  radical y  altered  the  nature  of  society  in  yet  another</p>

<p class="calibre1">lowering  the  opportunity  costs  of  mercantile  activity.  Rich  merchants  no</p>

<p class="calibre1">For  many  of  the  same  reasons  that  most  people  today  are  il -prepared  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">commerce  that  played  so  important  a  part  in  shaping  the  modern  period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people  ve centuries ago viewed their changing society in static terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Huizinga said, “Very little property is, in the modern sense, liquid, while</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  is  not  yet  associated  predominantly  with  money;  it  is  stil   rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherent  in  the  person  and  depends  on  a  sort  of  religious  awe  which  he</p>

<p class="calibre1">faithful fol owers. Feudal or hierarchic thought expresses the idea of grandeur</p>
<p class="calibre1">by visible signs.…” <a href="#calibre_link-7">24</a> Because people in the late Middle Ages thought before</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  else of status, they were il -prepared to comprehend that merchants could</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly contribute anything of importance to the life of the realm. Almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">without  exception,  merchants  were  commoners.  They  t  at  the  bottom  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the three estates, below the nobility and the clergy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  the  more  perceptive  thinkers  of  late-medieval  society  failed  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciate the importance of commerce and other forms of enterprise outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  farming  for  accumulating  wealth.  To  them,  poverty  was  an  apostolic</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtue.  They  literal y  made  no  distinction  between  a  wealthy  banker  and  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beggar. In Huizinga’s words, “No distinction in principle was made in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">This  blindness  to  the  economic  dimension  of  life  was  reinforced  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">churchmen, who were the ideological guardians of medieval life. They were</p>
<p class="calibre1">so far from grasping the importance of commerce that one widely applauded</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE BIRTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the keenest minds of the  fteenth century total y missed one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  important  developments  in  history,  one  that  began  under  their  eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  eclipse  of  feudalism  marked  the  onset  of  the  great  modern  phase  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Western predominance. It was a period of rising returns to violence and rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale in enterprise. For the past two and a half centuries, the modern economy</p>
<p class="calibre1">has delivered an unparal eled rise in living standards for that fraction of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world that enjoyed its greatest bene ts. The catalysts for these changes were</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  technologies,  from  gunpowder  weapons  to  the  printing  press,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed the boundaries of life in ways that few could grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the  nal decade of the  fteenth century, explorers like Columbus were</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  beginning  to  open  an  approach  to  vast,  unknown  continents.  For  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst time in the immemorial ages of human existence, the whole world was</p>
<p class="calibre1">compassed.  Gal eons,  new  high-masted  improvisations  on  Mediterranean</p>
<p class="calibre1">gal eys, circumnavigated the globe, charting the passages that were to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade  routes  and  thoroughfares  for  disease  and  conquest.  Conquistadors</p>
<p class="calibre1">wielding  their  new  bronze  cannon  on  sea  and  on  shore  blasted  open  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizons. They found fortunes in gold and spices, planted the seeds of new</p>
<p class="calibre1">cash crops, from tobacco to potatoes, and staked out new grazing lands for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their cattle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The First Industrial Technology</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the cannon was opening new economic horizons, the printing press</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened  new  intel ectual  horizons.  It  was  the  rst  machine  of  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">production, a signature technology that marked the onset of industrialism. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying  this,  we  share  the  view  advanced  by  Adam  Smith  in   <i class="calibre4">The  Wealth  of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Nations</i> that the Industrial Revolution had already happened wel  before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">121</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-102"></a>wrote.  It  had  not  reached  maturity,  to  be  sure,  but  the  principles  of  mass production and the factory system were wel  established. His famous example</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  pin  manufacturers  makes  this  case.  Smith  explains  how  eighteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">separate  operations  are  employed  to  produce  pins.  Because  of  specialized</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology and the division of labor, each employee could make 4,800 times</p>
<p class="calibre1">more pins in a day than an individual could fabricate on his own. <a href="#calibre_link-8">28</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith’s example underscores the fact that the Industrial Revolution began</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  earlier  than  historians  conventional y  assume.  Most  textbooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">would date its origins to the middle of the eighteenth century. That is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreasonable  as  a  date  for  the  takeo   stage  in  the  improvement  of  living</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards.  But  the  actual  megapolitical  transition  between  feudalism  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism  began  much  earlier,  at  the  end  of  the  fteenth  century.  Its</p>
<p class="calibre1">impact  was  felt  almost  immediately  in  the  transformation  of  dominant</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions, particularly in the eclipse of the medieval Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  historians  who  place  the  Industrial  Revolution  later  are  real y</p>
<p class="calibre1">measuring something else, the takeo  of living standards attributable to mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">production powered by engines. This raised the value of unskil ed labor and</p>
<p class="calibre1">led to fal ing prices for a wide variety of consumer goods. Indeed, the fact that</p>
<p class="calibre1">living standards began to rise sharply at di erent times in di erent countries</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  a  tip-o   that  something  other  than  the  megapolitical  transition  is  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">measured. The  <i class="calibre4">Cambridge Economic History of Europe</i> speaks of “Industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolutions” in the plural, explicitly linking them to the sustained growth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">national incomes. <a href="#calibre_link-8">29 </a>In Japan and Russia, this income surge was delayed until</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the nineteenth century. The rise in living standards and sustained</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth of national income in other parts of Asia and some parts of Africa was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a twentieth-century phenomenon. In some parts of Africa, sustained growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">remains a dream to this day. But that does not mean that these regions are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">living in the modern age. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Falling Income in Transition</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The growth of income is not synonymous with the advent of industrialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shift to an industrial society was a megapolitical event, not measurable</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly in income statistics. Indeed, real incomes for most Europeans fel  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  rst two centuries of the Industrial Age. They only began rising sometime</p>
<p class="calibre1">122</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-332"></a>after  the  beginning  of  the  eighteenth  century,  and  they  did  not  recover  to levels of 1250 until about 1750. We place the launch of the Industrial Age at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the  fteenth century. It was the industrial features of early-modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology, including chemical y powered weapons and printing presses, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitated the col apse of feudalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Lowering the Cost of Knowledge</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  capacity  to  mass-produce  books  was  incredibly  subversive  to  medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions,  just  as  microtechnology  wil   prove  subversive  to  the  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state.  Printing  rapidly  undermined  the  Church’s  monopoly  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">word of God, even as it created a new market for heresy. Ideas inimical to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed feudal society spread rapidly, as 10 mil ion books were published by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nal decade of the  fteenth century. Because the Church attempted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppress the printing press, most of the new volumes were published in those</p>
<p class="calibre1">areas of Europe where the writ of established authority was the weakest. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">may prove to be a close analogy with attempts by the U.S. government today</p>
<p class="calibre1">to suppress encryption technology. The Church found that censorship  did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not suppress the spread of subversive technology; it merely assured that it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">put to its most subversive use. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Depreciating the Monasteries</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many apparently innocent uses of the printing press were subversive because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their content. Merely the spread of knowledge of the fortunes to be earned</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  intrepid  adventurers  and  merchants  was  itself  a  powerful  solvent</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissolving the bonds of feudal obligation. The temptation of new markets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along with the need and opportunity to fund armies and navies on a larger</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale,  gave  money  a  value  it  had  lacked  in  the  feudal  centuries.  These  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">avenues  for  investment,  reinforced  by  powerful  weapons  that  raised  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns to violence, made it increasingly costly to the lord in the hinterlands</p>
<p class="calibre1">or the merchant in the city to donate his capital to the Church. Thus the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation of investment opportunities outside of landholdings destabilized the</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions of feudalism and undercut its ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">123</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-103"></a>Another  subversive  consequence  of  the  printing  press  was  its  e ect  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatical y lowering the costs of reproducing information. A crucial reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">why literacy and economic progress had been so minimal during the Middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ages was the high cost of duplicating manuscripts by hand. As we have seen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one of the major productive functions assumed by the Church after the fal</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Rome  was  reproducing  books  and  manuscripts  in  Benedictine</p>
<p class="calibre1">monasteries.  This  was  an  extremely  costly  undertaking.  One  of  the  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatic  consequences  of  printing  was  to  devalue  the  scriptoria,  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">monks  labored  day  after  day,  month  after  month  to  produce  manuscripts</p>
<p class="calibre1">that could be duplicated in hours by printing presses. The new technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">made  the  Benedictine  scriptorium  an  obsolete  and  costly  means  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproducing  knowledge.  This,  in  turn,  made  the  religious  orders  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church that sustained the scribes less economical y important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mass production of books ended the Church’s monopoly on Scripture, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel   as  on  other  forms  of  information.  The  wider  availability  of  books</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduced the cost of literacy and thus multiplied the number of thinkers who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  in  a  position  to  o er  their  own  opinions  on  important  subjects, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly theological subjects. As theological historian Euan Cameron put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,  “[a]  series  of  publishing  milestones”  in  the  rst  two  decades  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteenth  century  set  the  groundwork  for  the  application  of  “modern  text</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticism  to  Scriptures. <a href="#calibre_link-8">”30  </a>This  “threatened  the  monopoly”  of  the  Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">“by  questioning  corrupt  readings  of  texts  which  had  been  used  to  support</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional  dogmas.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">31  </a>This  new  knowledge  encouraged  the  emergence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  Protestant  sects  who  sought  to  formulate  their  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">interpretations of the Bible. Mass production of books lowered the cost of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heresy and gave the heretics large audiences of readers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Publishing  also  helped  destroy  the  medieval  worldview.  The  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">availability and lower costs for information led to shifts away from a view of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world linked by symbolism rather than causal connections. “Symbolism’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">image  of  the  world  is  distinguished  by  impeccable  order,  architectonic</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure, hierarchic subordination. For each symbolic connexion implies a</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erence of rank or sanctity.… The walnut signi es Christ; the sweet kernel</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  His  divine  nature,  the  green  and  pulpy  outer  peel  is  His  humanity,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden shel  between is the cross. Thus al  things raise the thoughts to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal.…” <a href="#calibre_link-8">32</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">124</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-346"></a>A  symbolic  mode  of  thinking  not  only  complemented  a  hierarchic</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure  of  society;  it  also  suited  il iteracy.  Ideas  conveyed  by  symbols  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">woodcuts were accessible to an il iterate population. By contrast, the advent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  printing  in  the  modern  period  led  to  the  development  of  causal</p>
<p class="calibre1">connections, employing the scienti c method, for a literate population. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A PARALLEL FOR TODAY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Medieval society, seemingly so stable and secure in its beliefs in the middle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  fteenth century, was rapidly transformed. Its predominant institution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Church, saw its monopoly chal enged and shattered. Authority that had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been unquestioned for centuries was suddenly in dispute. Beliefs and loyalties</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  sacred  than  those  that  bind  any  citizen  to  a  nation-state  today  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconsidered  and  renounced  within  a  few  short  years,  al   because  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological  revolution  that  came  into  its  own  in  the  last  decade  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that change as dramatic as that of  ve hundred years ago wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen  again.  The  Information  Revolution  wil   destroy  the  monopoly  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of the nation-state as surely as the Gunpowder Revolution destroyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Church’s monopoly. There is a striking analogy between the situation at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the end of the  fteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  organized  religion,  and  that  of  today,  when  the  world  has  become</p>
<p class="calibre1">saturated with politics. The Church then and the nation-state today are both</p>
<p class="calibre1">examples  of  institutions  grown  to  a  senile  extreme.  Like  the  late-medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church,  the  nation-state  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century  is  a  deeply</p>
<p class="calibre1">indebted  institution  that  can  no  longer  pay  its  way.  Its  operations  are  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">more irrelevant and even counterproductive to the prosperity of those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">not long ago might have been its staunchest supporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Impoverished, Grasping, and Extravagant” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as government today o ers poor value for the money it col ects, so did</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Church  at  the  end  of  the  fteenth  century.  As  ecclesiastical  historian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Euan Cameron put it, “[A]n impoverished local priesthood seemed to o er a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor service for the money it demanded; much of what was levied e ectively</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-104"></a>‘disappeared”  into  enclosed  monasteries  or  the  arcane  areas  of  higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">education or administration. In spite of gifts prodigal y given to some sectors</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Church, the institution as a whole managed to appear simultaneously</p>
<p class="calibre1">impoverished,  grasping,  and  extravagant.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">33</a>  It  would  be  hard  to  deny  the paral el with late-twentieth-century government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Religious  observances  in  the  late  fteenth  century  grew  like  programs</p>
<p class="calibre1">proliferating  in  welfare  states  today.  Not  only  did  special  benedictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiply  endlessly,  along  with  the  supply  of  saints  and  saints’  bones,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">every year there were more churches, more convents, more monasteries, more</p>
<p class="calibre1">friaries,  more  confessors  (resident  household  priests),  more  preacherships, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  cathedral  chapters,  more  endowed  chantries,  more  relic  cults,  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious co-fraternities, more religious festivals, and new holy days. Services</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew longer. Prayers and hymns grew more complicated. One after another, </p>
<p class="calibre1">new mendicant orders appeared to beg for alms. The result was institutional</p>
<p class="calibre1">overload similar to that characterizing heavily politicized societies today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Religious festivals and feast days proliferated on al  sides. Religious services</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew more numerous, with special festivals in honor of the seven sorrows of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary, of her sisters, and of al  the saints of Jesus’ genealogy. <a href="#calibre_link-8">34 </a>For the faithful to  meet  their  religious  obligations  became  increasingly  costly  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">holding land as compared to money capital was fal ing. Yet the medieval mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued to think in terms of a status-bound society, where social position</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  determined  by  who  you  were,  rather  than  by  your  skil   in  deploying</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital  e ectively.  Little  or  no  consideration  was  given  to  the  rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  costs  of  staging  exaggerated  religious  observances.  These  costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">fel   most  heavily  upon  the  more  ambitious  and  hardworking  peasants, </p>
<p class="calibre1">burghers,  and  yeoman  farmers,  who  depended  more  than  the  aristocracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  deploying  their  capital  useful y.  They  were  obliged  to  shoulder  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">126</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-355"></a>disproportionate  cost  of  out tting  the  tables  at  the  endless  feasts  and  holy days  (holidays),  as  wel   as  paying  to  support  an  extravagant  Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Counterproductive Regulation</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  end  of  the  fteenth  century,  the  Church  largely  control ed  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">regulatory  powers  that  have  since  been  assumed  by  governments.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church  dominated  important  areas  of  law,  recording  deeds,  registering</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriages, probating wil s, licensing trades, titling land, and stipulating terms</p>
<p class="calibre1">and conditions of commerce. The details of life were almost as thoroughly</p>
<p class="calibre1">regulated by canon law as they are today by bureaucracy, and to much the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same  end.  Just  as  political  regulation  today  has  become  riddled  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusions  and  contradictions,  so  canon  law  was  ve  hundred  years  ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These regulations often suppressed and complicated commerce in ways that</p>
<p class="calibre1">revealed  that  facilitating  productivity  was  far  from  the  minds  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">regulators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  example,  it  was  forbidden  to  do  business  for  an  entire  year  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever  day  of  the  week  the  most  recent  twenty-eighth  of  December</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened  to  fal .  Thus  if  it  was  a  Tuesday,  no  legal  business  could  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">conducted on Tuesdays as an obligatory expression of piety in honor of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slaughter of the Innocents. On years when December 28 fel  on any day other</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  Sunday,  this  injunction  hampered  the  potential  for  many  types  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce,  increasing  costs  by  delaying  transactions  or  forestal ing  them</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Monopoly Pricing</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Canon  law  was  also  imposed  to  reinforce  monopoly  prices.  The  Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">earned signi cant revenues from the sale of alum mined from its properties in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tolfa,  Italy.  When  some  of  its  customers  in  the  textile  industry  showed  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">preference for cheaper alum imported from Turkey, the Vatican attempted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustain its monopoly pricing through canon law, declaring it sinful to use the</p>
<p class="calibre1">less costly alum. Merchants who persisted in purchasing the cheaper Turkish</p>
<p class="calibre1">product were excommunicated. The famous ban on eating meat on Friday</p>
<p class="calibre1">127</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-105"></a>originated  in  the  same  spirit.  The  Church  was  not  only  the  largest  feudal landholder;  it  also  held  major  sheries.  Church  Fathers  discovered  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">theological necessity for the pious to eat  sh, which not incidental y ensured a</p>
<p class="calibre1">demand for their product at a time when transport and sanitary conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">discouraged  sh consumption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the nation-state today, the late-medieval Church not only regulated</p>
<p class="calibre1">speci c industries to directly underpin its own interests; it also made the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of its regulatory powers to gain revenue for itself in other ways. Clerics went</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  special  pains  to  promulgate  regulations  and  edicts  that  were  di cult  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide by. For example, incest was very broadly de ned, so that even remote</p>
<p class="calibre1">cousins  and  persons  related  only  by  marriage  required  special  dispensation</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the Church to marry. As this included almost everyone in many smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">European  vil ages  before  the  era  of  modern  travel,  sel ing  waivers  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">incestuous marriages became a thriving source of Church revenue. Even sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">within  marriage  itself  was  tightly  circumscribed  by  ecclesiastic  regulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sexual relations between spouses were il egal on Sundays, Wednesdays, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fridays,  as  wel   as  for  forty  days  prior  to  Easter  and  Christmas.  Further, </p>
<p class="calibre1">couples  were  to  abstain  from  sex  for  three  days  prior  to  receiving</p>
<p class="calibre1">communion.  In  other  words,  married  couples  were  forbidden  to  enjoy  sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">without an indulgence for a minimum of 55 percent of the days of the year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  <i class="calibre4">The Bishop's Brothels, </i> historian E. J. Burford suggests that these “idiotic” </p>
<p class="calibre1">regulations of marriage helped stimulate the growth of medieval prostitution, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from which the Church pro ted mightily<a href="#calibre_link-8">.35</a> Burford reports that the Bishop</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Winchester  was  for  many  centuries  the  principal  of  London’s  Bankside</p>
<p class="calibre1">brothels in Southwark. Further, ecclesiastical pro teering from prostitution</p>
<p class="calibre1">was by no means merely a local English a air:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pope Sixtus IV (c. 1471) who al egedly caught syphilis from one of his many</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistresses&mdash;became the  rst pope to issue licences to prostitutes and to levy a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  on  their  earnings,  augmenting  vastly  the  papal  revenues  in  the  process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed the Roman Curia partly  nanced the building of St. Peter’s by this tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the sale of licences. His successor, Pope Leo X, is said to have made some</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-two  thousand  gold  ducats  through  the  sale  of  licences,  four  times  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much as he made by sel ing indulgences in Germany. <a href="#calibre_link-8">36</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">128</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-106"></a>Even the famous rule of celibacy imposed on priests was a lucrative source</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  revenue  for  the  medieval  Church.  As  Burford  reports,  the  Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">imposed “a racket known as  <i class="calibre4">cullagium," </i> a fee imposed upon “concubinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">priests.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">37</a> This proved so lucrative that it was imposed uniformly upon al</p>
<p class="calibre1">priests by bishops in France and Germany, in spite of the fact that the Lateran</p>
<p class="calibre1">Council  in  1215  had  denounced  “this  disgraceful  tra c  by  which  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">prelates  regularly  sel   permission  to  sin.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">38</a>  It  was  merely  one  of  many lucrative markets for the sale of licenses to infringe canon law and regulation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a trade motivated by the same logic that impels grasping politicians to seek</p>
<p class="calibre1">arbitrary regulatory powers over commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Indulgences</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The power to regulate arbitrarily is also the power to sel  an exemption from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  harm  such  regulations  can  do.  The  Church  sold  permits,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“indulgences,”  authorizing  everything  from  relief  from  petty  burdens  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce to permission to eat dairy products in Lent. These “indulgences” </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  only  sold  at  high  prices  to  the  aristocracy  and  the  rich  burghers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  also  packaged  as  lottery  prizes  much  like  the  government-run</p>
<p class="calibre1">lotteries  of  today  to  attract  the  pennies  of  the  poor<a href="#calibre_link-8">.39  </a>The  trade  in indulgences increased as the Church’s expenditures outran its income. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">led  many  to  infer  the  obvious,  that  the  institutional  Church  was  using  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers primarily to raise revenues. As a contemporary critic put it, “[C]anon</p>
<p class="calibre1">law was instituted solely for the purpose of making a great deal of money; </p>
<p class="calibre1">whoever would be a Christian has to buy his way out of its provisions. <a href="#calibre_link-8">”40</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Bureaucratic Overload</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The costs of supporting institutionalized religion at the end of the  fteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  had  reached  a  historic  extreme,  much  as  the  costs  of  supporting</p>
<p class="calibre1">government have reached a senile extreme today. The more life was saturated</p>
<p class="calibre1">with religion, the more expensive and bureaucratic the Church became. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron’s words, “It was far easier to  nd people to  l  the vastly increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">number of Church posts at the end of the Middle Ages, than to  nd money</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  pay  for  them.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">41</a>  Just  as  bankrupt  governments  today  scrounge  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">129</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-107"></a>revenues  in  counterproductive  ways,  so  did  the  Church  ve  hundred  years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago. Indeed, the churchmen used some of the same predatory tricks mastered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the politicians today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The medieval Church  ve hundred years ago, like the nation-state today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">consumed more of society’s resources than it ever had before, or ever would</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. The Church then, like the state today, seemed incapable of functioning</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sustaining itself on even record amounts of revenue. Just as the state has</p>
<p class="calibre1">come to dominate late-industrial economies, spending more than half of al</p>
<p class="calibre1">revenue in some Western European countries, so the Church dominated the</p>
<p class="calibre1">late-feudal economy, draining resources and retarding growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Deficit Spending in the Fifteenth Century</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Church resorted to every conceivable expedient to squeeze more money</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of its charges to feed its overgrown bureaucracy. Regions directly under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lordship of the Church were required to pay higher and higher taxes. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">provinces and kingdoms where the Church lacked direct taxing power, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vatican imposed “annates,” a payment to be made by the local sovereign in</p>
<p class="calibre1">lieu of direct ecclesiastic taxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Church,  like  the  state  today,  also  raided  its  own  co ers,  diverting</p>
<p class="calibre1">funds  from  benefactions  earmarked  for  speci c  uses  to  pay  for  general</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead expenses. Bene ces and venal religious o ces were openly sold, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">were the income streams from tithes. In e ect, the interests in tithes became</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ecclesiastic equivalent of bonds issued by modern governments to  nance</p>
<p class="calibre1">their chronic de cits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the Church was the ideological defender of feudalism and critic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce  and  capitalism,  like  the  nation-state  today,  it  utilized  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">available  marketing  technique  to  optimize  its  own  revenues.  The  Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">operated a thriving business in the sale of sacramentals, including consecrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">candles,  palms  blessed  on  Palm  Sunday,  “herbs  blessed  on  the  Feast  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assumption, and especial y the varieties of Holy Water.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">42</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like today’s politicians who threaten constituents with curtailed garbage</p>
<p class="calibre1">pickup  and  other  indignities  if  they  decline  to  pay  higher  taxes,  religious</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  in  the  fteenth  century  were  also  prone  to  cutting  o   religious</p>
<p class="calibre1">services to blackmail congregations into paying arbitrary  nes. Often the  nes</p>
<p class="calibre1">130</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-108"></a>were imposed for some petty o ense done by a few persons who need not</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  have  been  members  of  the  congregation  in  question.  For  example,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1436,  Bishop  Jacques  Du  Chatelier,  “a  very  ostentatious,  grasping  man,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">closed the Church of the Innocents in Paris for twenty-two days, halting al</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious services while waiting for an impossibly large  ne to be paid by two</p>
<p class="calibre1">beggars. The men had quarreled in the church and shed a few drops of blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which the bishop claimed had deconsecrated the church. He would not al ow</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone to use the church for weddings, burials, or the normal sacraments of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the calendar until his  ne was paid. <a href="#calibre_link-8">43</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Hatred of Church Leaders</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Little wonder that the common opinion of the late  fteenth century despised</p>
<p class="calibre1">the higher and lower clergy, much as common opinion in highly politicized</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies today despises the bureaucracy and politicians. As Johan Huizinga</p>
<p class="calibre1">put  it,  “Hatred  is  the  right  word  to  use  in  this  context,  for  hatred  it  was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">latent, but general and persistent. The people never wearied of hearing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vices  of  the  clergy  arraigned.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">45</a>  Part  of  the  reason  that  people  were commonly convinced that the Church was “grasping and extravagant” is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  was  true.  “The  worldliness  of  the  higher  ranks  of  the  clergy  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deterioration  of  the  lower  grades” <a href="#calibre_link-8">46</a>  were  too  obvious  to  miss.  From  the parish priest to the pope himself, the clergy appeared to be corrupt as only</p>
<p class="calibre1">the personnel of a predominant institution can be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  hundred  years  ago,  the  pope,  Alexander  VI,  made  even  Giulio</p>
<p class="calibre1">Andreotti and Bil  Clinton seem like exemplars of integrity. Alexander VI was</p>
<p class="calibre1">known for his wild parties. As a cardinal in Siena, he staged a famous orgy to</p>
<p class="calibre1">131</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-109"></a>which only “Siena’s most beautiful young women had been invited, but their</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘husbands, fathers, and brothers’ had been excluded.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">47 </a>The Siena orgy was</p>
<p class="calibre1">famous, but it later proved to be tame compared to those Alexander threw</p>
<p class="calibre1">after becoming pope. Perhaps the most lurid of those was the so-cal ed Bal et</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Chestnuts, which involved Rome’s “ fty most beautiful whores” in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">copulation contest with the Church Fathers and other important Romans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Wil iam  Manchester  describes  it,  “Servants  kept  score  of  each  man’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">orgasms,  for  the  pope  greatly  admired  virility.…  After  everyone  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausted,  His  Holiness  distributed  prizes&mdash;cloaks,  boots,  caps,  and  ne</p>
<p class="calibre1">silken tunics. The winners, the diarist wrote, were those who made love with</p>
<p class="calibre1">those courtesans the greatest number of times.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">48</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexander fathered at least seven and perhaps eight il egitimate children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of his apparent sons, Giovanni, was the so-cal ed Infans Romanus, born</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Alexander’s il egitimate daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, when she was eighteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a secret papal bul , Alexander admitted fathering Giovanni. If he was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  father,  he  was  certainly  the  grandfather  on  both  sides.  The  pope  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved  in  a  three-way  incestuous  a air  with  Lucrezia,  who  was  also  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistress of Juan, duke of Gandia, Alexander’s oldest il egitimate son, as wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the mistress of another il egitimate son, Cardinal Cesare Borgia. Cesare was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the prince of the Church who served as Niccolò Machia-vel i’s inspiration for</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The  Prince. </i>  Cesare  was  a  kil er,  as  was  the  pope,  who  was  known  to  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">plotted several murders. One or the other of them apparently became jealous</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Juan, whose lifeless body was  shed out of the Tiber River on June 15, </p>
<p class="calibre1">1497. <a href="#calibre_link-8">49</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  leadership  of  the  late-medieval  Church  was  as  corrupt  as  the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HYPOCRISY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath  a  “super cial  crust  of  piety,”  late-medieval  society  was  remarkably</p>
<p class="calibre1">blasphemous, irreverent, and debauched. Churches were the favorite trysting</p>
<p class="calibre1">132</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-110"></a>places of young men and women, and frequent gathering spots of prostitutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and vendors of obscene pictures. Historians report that “the irreverence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">daily religious practice was almost unbounded. <a href="#calibre_link-8">”51</a> Choristers hired to chant</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the souls of the dead commonly substituted profane words in the mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vigils  and  processions,  which  played  a  far  bigger  role  in  medieval  religious</p>
<p class="calibre1">practice than they do today, were nonetheless “disgraced by ribaldry, mockery</p>
<p class="calibre1">and drinking.” So said late-medieval Europe’s leading theological authority, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Denis the Carthusian<a href="#calibre_link-8">.52</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">While  such  a  report  could  be  chal enged  as  the  griping  of  a  sti -lipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">moralist, it is merely one of many accounts that paint the same picture. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is ample reason to believe that the bawdy and the sacred were frequently close</p>
<p class="calibre1">companions in medieval life. Pilgrimages, for example, so often degenerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">into riot and debauchery that high-minded reformers argued without success</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  be  suppressed.  Local  religious  processions  also  provided  regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasions  for  mobs  to  vandalize,  loot,  and  general y  indulge  in  whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">drunken antics caught their fancy. Even when people sat stil  to hear mass, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  frequently  not  a  sober  experience.  Prodigious  quantities  of  wine  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">consumed  in  church,  especial y  on  festival  nights.  Accounts  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Council  of  Strasbourg  show  that  those  who  “watched  in  prayer”  on  St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adolphus Night drank 1,100 liters of wine provided by the council in honor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the saint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean Gerson, a leading  fteenth-century theologian, reports that “the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacred festivals, even Christmas night,” were spent “in debauchery, playing at</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,  swearing  and  blaspheming.”  When  admonished  for  these  lapses,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">common  people  “plead  the  example  of  the  nobility  and  the  clergy,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">behave in like manner with impunity.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">53</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Piety and Compassion</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The piety that rationalized the saturation of society by organized religion in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  late  Middle  Ages  served  the  same  purpose  as  the  “compassion”  that  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant to justify the political domination of life today. The sale of indulgences</p>
<p class="calibre1">to satisfy a desire for piety without morals paral els lavish welfare spending to</p>
<p class="calibre1">slake the pretense of compassion without charity. It was largely immaterial</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether the actual e ect of received practices was to improve moral character</p>
<p class="calibre1">133</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-111"></a>or  save  souls,  just  as  it  is  largely  immaterial  whether  a  welfare  program actual y improves the lives of the people to whom it is directed. “Piety,” like</p>
<p class="calibre1">“compassion,” was an almost superstitious invocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a time when causal relationships were scarcely understood, rituals and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacraments of the Church permeated every phase of life. “… A journey, a task, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  visit,  were  equal y  attended  by  a  thousand  formalities:  benedictions, </p>

<p class="calibre1">draped  locks  of  their  hair  in  front  of  the  image  of  St.  Urban  to  prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">further hair loss. Peasants in Navarre marched in processions behind an image</p>
<p class="calibre1">of St. Peter to solicit rain during droughts<a href="#calibre_link-8">.55 </a>People eagerly adopted these and other  “ine ective  techniques  to  al ay  anxiety  when  e ective  ones  were  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">available.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">56</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Two Wrongs to Make a Rite</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People were so  rmly convinced of the miraculous qualities attaching to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">relics  of  saints  that  the  death  of  any  notably  pious  person  frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasioned a mad rush to divide up the body. After Thomas Aquinas died in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  monastery  of  Fossanuova,  the  monks  there  decapitated  and  boiled  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">body in order to secure control of his bones. When St. Elizabeth of Hungary</p>
<p class="calibre1">was lying in state, “a crowd of worshippers came and cut or tore strips of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">linen enveloping her face; they cut o  the hair, the nails, even the nipples. <a href="#calibre_link-8">”57</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Piety Without Virtue</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  medieval  mind  saw  the  saints  and  their  relics  as  part  of  the  arsenal  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith in a world that was colder in winter, darker at night, and more desperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  face  of  disease  than  any  reader  of  this  book  wil   have  been  likely  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. More emphatical y than in the modern period, people in the Middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ages  believed  that  demons  were  real,  that  God  actively  intervened  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, and that prayer, penance, and pilgrimages earned divine favor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  say  simply  that  people  believed  in  God  could  convey  neither  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensity of their adherence nor the apparent ease with which medieval piety</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed  to  bed  down  with  sin.  Belief  in  the  e cacy  of  rites,  rituals,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">134</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-112"></a>sacraments was so pervasive that it perhaps inevitably undercut the urgency</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  behaving  in  a  virtuous  way.  For  any  sin  or  spiritual  defect  there  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">remedy,  a  penance  that  would  clear  the  slate,  in  what  came  to  be  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“mathematics  of  salvation.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">58  </a>Religion  became  so  al -pervasive  that  its sincerity necessarily began to  ag. As Huizinga put it, “Religion penetrating</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  relations in life means a constant blending of the spheres of holy and of</p>
<p class="calibre1">profane thought. Holy things wil  become too common to be deeply felt.” <a href="#calibre_link-8">59</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DOWNSIZING THE CHURCH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of the  fteenth century, the Church was not only as corrupt as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state today; it was also a major drag on economic growth. The Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">engrossed large amounts of capital in unproductive ways, imposing burdens</p>
<p class="calibre1">that limited the output of society and suppressed commerce. These burdens, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like those imposed by the nation-state today, were numerous. We know what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened to organized religion in the wake of the Gunpowder Revolution: it</p>
<p class="calibre1">created  strong  incentives  to  downsize  religious  institutions  and  lower  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs.  When  the  traditional  Church  declined  to  do  this,  Protestant  sects</p>
<p class="calibre1">seized the opportunity to compete. In so doing they employed almost every</p>
<p class="calibre1">device imaginable to reduce the cost of living a-pious life:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They built spare new churches and sometimes stripped the altars of older</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones to free capital for other uses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They revised Christian doctrine in ways that lowered costs, emphasizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">faith over good deeds as a key to salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  developed  a  new,  terse  liturgy,  pared  or  eliminated  feast  days,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">abolished numerous sacraments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  closed  monasteries  and  nunneries,  and  stopped  giving  alms  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mendicant  orders.  Poverty  went  from  being  an  apostolic  virtue  to  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwelcome and often blameworthy social problem. <a href="#calibre_link-9">60</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">To  understand  how  downsizing  the  Church  liberated  productivity,  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to review the many ways that the Church stood in the way of growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  its  monopoly  was  broken.  Much  as  the  nation-state  does  today,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">135</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-113"></a>Church at the end of the  fteenth century imposed an incredible burden of</p>
<p class="calibre1">excess costs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.  Direct  costs  such  as  tithes,  taxes,  and  fees  fed  the  overgrown</p>
<p class="calibre1">ecclesiastical bureaucracy. Tithes were common to Protestant churches that</p>
<p class="calibre1">replaced the medieval “Holy Mother Church” also, but they tended not to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ectible in urban areas. In e ect, the end of the Church’s monopoly led to</p>
<p class="calibre1">declining  marginal  tax  rates  in  regions  with  the  most  highly  developed</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  Religious  doctrines  made  saving  di cult.  The  arch-vil ain  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval Church was the “miser,” the person who saved his gold at the risk of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  soul.  The  requirement  for  the  faithful  to  fund  “good  deeds”  entailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">costly contributions to the Church. The doctrine of “satisfactions” obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">those concerned about salvation to endow masses or “chantries” in order to</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid purgatory. Luther attacked this directly in the eighth and thirteenth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ninety- ve theses. He wrote that “the dying wil  pay al  their debts by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">death.” <a href="#calibre_link-9">61</a> In other words, the capital of the Protestant believer was available</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  pass  on  to  his  heirs.  Under  Protestant  doctrine,  there  was  no  need  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">endow chantries to repeat masses, usual y for thirty years, and sometimes, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the very wealthy, in perpetuity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  The  ideology  of  the  medieval  Church  also  encouraged  diversion  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital  into  acquisition  of  relics.  Numerous  relic  cults  were  endowed  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">large sums to acquire physical objects associated with Christ or various saints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The very wealthy even assembled personal col ections of relics. For example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Elector  Frederick  of  Saxony  amassed  a  col ection  of  nineteen  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">relics,  some  acquired  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Jerusalem  in  1493.  His  col ection</p>
<p class="calibre1">included what he believed to be “the body of a holy innocent, Mary’s milk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  straw  from  the  stable  of  the  Nativity. <a href="#calibre_link-9">”62  </a>Presumably,  the  return  on capital invested in these relics was low. The shift to an emphasis on faith and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  notion  of  the  elect  downgraded  the  importance  of  acquisition  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trappings of Christian life for use as charms and encouraged money to  nd</p>
<p class="calibre1">more productive channels that paid a return that the monarch could tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. The advent of Protestant denominations broke the medieval Church’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic monopolies, and led to a signi cant weakening of regulation. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">we have seen, canon law was frequently bent to support Church monopolies</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  commercial  interests.  Because  the  new  denominations  had  fewer</p>
<p class="calibre1">136</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-114"></a>economic interests to protect and promote, their version of religious doctrine</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended to result in a freer system, with fewer inhibitions of commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. The Protestant revolution abolished many of the rites and rituals of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval Church that burdened the time of the faithful. Rites, sacraments, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and holy days had been elaborated to absorb almost the entire calendar by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">late  fteenth  century.  This  ceremonial  overload  was  a  logical  outgrowth  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Church’s insistence “that one could multiply acts of prayer or worship as</p>
<p class="calibre1">often  as  one  liked  and  gain  bene ts  from  them.” <a href="#calibre_link-9">63</a>  Multiply  they  did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Productivity was taxed by longer and more elaborate services, obligations to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recite  repetitious  prayers  in  penance,  and  the  proliferation  of  feast  days  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">saints  during  which  no  work  could  be  done.  Numerous  regulations  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceremonies punctuated the day and the seasons, considerably shrinking the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time available for productive tasks. This may have done little to interrupt the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhythms of medieval farming, in which 90 percent or more of the population</p>
<p class="calibre1">was engaged. There were many periods during the seasons when  eld labor</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  not  required  on  a  daily  basis.  The  yield  of  crops  under  medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  probably  varied  more  with  the  weather  and  uncontrol able</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhythms of infestation than from any marginal addition of labor beyond the</p>
<p class="calibre1">minimum that the Church calendar accommodated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The larger problem of lost productivity did not fal  so much in farming as</p>
<p class="calibre1">in other areas. The Church’s demands on time were far less compatible with</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft  work,  manufacturing,  transport,  commerce,  or  any  other  undertaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">where productivity and pro tability were likely to be crucial y determined by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the amount of time devoted to the task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  may  not  be  a  coincidence  that  the  great  transition  at  the  end  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fteenth  century  occurred  at  a  time  when  land  rents  were  rising  and  real</p>
<p class="calibre1">wages for the peasantry were in decline. Increased population pressures had</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduced the yield from the common lands, often found surrounding rivers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and streams, upon which peasants depended to graze their livestock, and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  cases,  for  sh  and  rewood.  The  whittling  down  of  living  standards</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed increasingly urgent pressures on peasants to  nd alternative sources of</p>
<p class="calibre1">income. As a result, “more and more of the rural population turned to smal -</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale manufacturing for the market, above al  in textiles, in the process known</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  ‘putting-out’  or  ‘proto-industrialization.’ <a href="#calibre_link-9">”64</a>  The  ceremonial  burdens  on time  imposed  by  the  Church  stood  in  the  way  of  e orts  by  the  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">137</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-339"></a>ambitious  peasants  to  supplement  their  farming  income  by  craft  work,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed they inhibited any redeployment of e ort in new economic directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the more pronounced contributions that Protestant sects made to</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity was the scrapping of forty feast days. This not only saved the</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerable  costs  of  staging  the  festivals,  including  out tting  the  vil age</p>
<p class="calibre1">tables  with  food  and  drink;  it  also  freed  a  great  deal  of  valuable  time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Implicitly,  everyone  who  stopped  honoring  the  forty  banished  feast  days</p>
<p class="calibre1">could add three hundred man-hours or more to his annual productivity. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">short, the scrapping of ceremonial overload in the medieval Church opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  way  for  an  appreciable  increase  in  output  simply  by  freeing  time  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would otherwise have been lost to commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6. The break in the Church’s monopoly disgorged vast amounts of assets</p>
<p class="calibre1">that were yielding low returns under Church management&mdash;a situation with</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious paral els to state holdings late in the twentieth century. The Church</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the largest feudal landholder by far. Its grip on the land matched that of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  state  in  highly  politicized  societies  today&mdash;exceeding  50  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">total in some European countries such as Bohemia. According to canon law, </p>
<p class="calibre1">once  a  property  came  under  the  control  of  the  Church,  it  could  not  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">alienated. Thus the holdings of Church land tended steadily to rise, as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church  received  more  and  more  testamentary  gifts  from  the  faithful  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">nancing various social welfare services, chantries, and other activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  it  is  di cult  to  measure  precisely  the  relative  productivity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church holdings, it must have been far lower at the end of the Middle Ages</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  it  was  in  the  early  part  of  that  epoch.  By  the  fourteenth  century, </p>
<p class="calibre1">increased emphasis upon production for the market rather than subsistence</p>
<p class="calibre1">farming had led most lay lords to turn from il iterate headmen to professional</p>
<p class="calibre1">managers to optimize the output of their holdings. Their incentives probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">led  them  to  quickly  outstrip  the  output  of  Church  properties,  which  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory usual y did not accrue to anyone’s private pro t. No doubt some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  more  worldly  prince-bishops  husbanded  their  estates  in  ways</p>
<p class="calibre1">indistinguishable from those of the lay lords. Yet the productivity of other</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church  properties  would  surely  have  su ered  from  failures  of  indi erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">management by a huge, far- ung institution, whose drawbacks would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been similar to the drawbacks of state and communal ownership today. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious, as wel , that the seizure of the monasteries rearrayed resources that</p>
<p class="calibre1">138</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-115"></a>were no longer needed for the reproduction of books and manuscripts after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the advent of the printing press. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  As  we  detailed  in   <i class="calibre4">The  Great  Reckoning, </i>  some  of  the  Protestant  sects</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately  responded  to  the  Gunpowder  Revolution  by  altering  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrines  in  ways  that  encouraged  commerce,  such  as  by  lifting  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">injunction against usury, or lending at interest. The ideological opposition of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  medieval  Church  to  capitalism  was  a  drag  on  growth.  The  main</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideological thrust of Church teachings was to reinforce feudalism, in which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Church had a large stake, as the largest feudal landholder. Consciously, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">not,  the  Church  tended  to  make  religious  virtues  of  its  own  economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests,  while  militating  against  the  development  of  manufacturing  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.  Injunctions  against  “avarice,”  for  example,  applied  mainly  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  transactions  rather  than  feudal  levies,  and  never  to  the  sale  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulgences. The infamous attempts by the Church to  x a “just price” for</p>
<p class="calibre1">items in commerce tended to suppress economic returns on those products</p>
<p class="calibre1">and services where the Church itself was not a producer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ban  on  “usury”  was  a  signal  example  of  the  Church’s  resistance  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial innovation. Banking and credit were crucial to the development</p>
<p class="calibre1">of larger-scale commercial enterprises. By restricting the availability of credit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the Church retarded growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8.  More  subtly,  the  new  denominations’  focus  upon  the  Bible  as  a  text</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  demolish  the  medieval  Church’s  mode  of  thought  as  wel   as  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideology.  Both  placed  obstacles  in  the  way  of  growth.  The  cultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">programming of the late Middle Ages encouraged people to see the world in</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms of symbolic similitude rather than cause and e ect. This short-circuited</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasoning.  It  also  pointed  away  from  a  mercantile  conception  of  life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking  in  terms  of  symbolic  equivalences  does  not  easily  translate  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking in terms of market values. “The three estates represent the qualities</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Virgin. The seven electors of the Empire signify the virtues; the  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">towns of Artois and Hainault, which in 1477 remained faithful to the house</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Burgundy, are the  ve wise virgins.… In the same way shoes mean care and</p>
<p class="calibre1">diligence,  stockings  perseverance,  the  garter  resolution,  etc.” <a href="#calibre_link-9">65  </a>As  this example  quoted  from  the  distinguished  medieval  historian  Johan  Huizinga</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggests, thinking was dominated by dogma, rigid symbols, and al egory that</p>
<p class="calibre1">139</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-116"></a>tied together every aspect of life in terms of hierarchic subordination. Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation,  every  part,  every  color,  every  number,  even  every  element  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammar was tied into a grand system of religious conceptions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the mundane bits and pieces of life were interpreted not in terms of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  causal  connections,  but  in  terms  of  static  symbols  and  al egories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes  personifying  virtues  and  vices,  each  thing  stood  for  something, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which stood for something else again, in ways that often blocked rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">clari ed cause and e ect To confuse matters further, relationships were often</p>
<p class="calibre1">arbitrarily bound together in systems of numbers. Sevens played a particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">important role. There were the seven virtues, the seven deadly sins, the seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplications  of  the  Lord’s  Prayer,  the  seven  Gifts  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seven  moments  of  the  passion,  the  seven  beatitudes,  and  the  seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacraments,  “represented  by  the  seven  animals  and  fol owed  by  the  seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">diseases.” <a href="#calibre_link-9">66</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Fifteenth-Century Journalism</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  fteenth-century  news  story,  if  it  had  been  written,  would  not  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered  any  of  the  classic  questions  of  reporting  facts,  except  indirectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">through al egoric personi cation. Consider this report, in a private diary, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Burgundian murders in  fteenth-century Paris:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then arose the goddess of Discord, who lived in the tower of Evil Counsel, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">awoke Wrath, the mad woman, and Covetousness and Rage and Vengeance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and they took up arms of al  sorts and cast out Reason, Justice, Remembrance</p>

<p class="calibre1">Murder and Slaughter kil ed, cut down, put to death, massacred al  they found</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  prisons.…  and  Covetousness  tucked  up  her  skirts  into  her  belt  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">Vengeance, who led them through al  the public prisons of Paris, etc<a href="#calibre_link-9">.67</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The shift away from the medieval paradigm helped prepare people to think in</p>
<p class="calibre1">“modern”  terms  about  cause  and  e ect,  rather  than  in  terms  of  symbolic</p>
<p class="calibre1">linkages and al egoric personi cation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not necessary to argue that the doctrine and mode of thinking of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">late-medieval Church were insincere to see that they tended to  t closely with</p>
<p class="calibre1">140</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-117"></a>the needs of agrarian feudalism, while al owing very little place for commerce, </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  less  industrial  development.  It  was  rather  a  case  of  the  Church  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominant  institution  shaping  moral,  cultural,  and  legal  constraints  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways  that  were  closely  tted  to  the  imperatives  of  feudalism.  For  this  very</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason, they were il -suited to the needs of industrial society, just as the moral, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cultural,  and  legal  constraints  of  the  modern  nation-state  are  il -suited  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitating commerce in the Information Age. We believe that the state wil</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Protestant doctrine that heaven could be attained by faith alone and</p>

<p class="calibre1">opportunity costs of sinking additional capital into the bloated ecclesiastical</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucracy had suddenly risen. People had minded less giving their money</p>

<p class="calibre1">and the increased megapolitical power of the rich led to a sharp reduction in</p>
<p class="calibre1">income  redistribution.  The  peasants  and  urban  poor  who  were  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate bene ciaries of the new system were bitterly envious of those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were.  Huizinga  described  the  prevailing  attitude,  in  what  could  wel   be  an</p>

<p class="calibre1">especial y of the new rich, who were then very numerous, is general.” <a href="#calibre_link-9">68</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">An equal y striking paral el arose from a tremendous surge in crime. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakdown of the old order almost always unleashes a surge in crime, if not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the outright anarchy of the feudal revolution we explored in the last chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the Middle Ages, crime also skyrocketed as the old systems of</p>

<p class="calibre1">the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The modern world was born in the confusion of new technologies, new</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;ROBERT DE BALSAC, 1502</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE RUBBLE OF HISTORY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On  November  9  and  10,  1989,  television  broadcast  to  the  world  scenes  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">exuberant  East  Berliners  dismantling  the  Berlin  Wal   with  sledgehammers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fledgling entrepreneurs among the crowd picked up pieces of the wal  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were later marketed to capitalists far and wide as souvenir paperweights. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">brisk business in these relics was done for years thereafter. Even as we write, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one can stil  encounter occasional ads in smal  magazines o ering bits of old</p>
<p class="calibre1">East German concrete for sale at prices ordinarily commanded by high-grade</p>
<p class="calibre1">silver  ore.  We  believe  that  those  who  bought  the  Berlin  Wal   paperweights</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be in no rush to sel . They hold mementos of something bigger than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the col apse of Communism. We believe that the Berlin Wal  became the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">important  pile  of  historical  rubble  since  the  wal s  of  San  Giovanni  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">blasted to smithereens almost  ve centuries earlier in February 1495. <a href="#calibre_link-9">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">143</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-479"></a>The leveling of San Giovanni by the French king Charles VIII was the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">blast of the Gunpowder Revolution. It marked the end of the feudal phase of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history  and  the  advent  of  industrialism,  as  we  outlined  earlier.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction of the Berlin Wal  marks another historical watershed, the passage</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the Industrial Age and the new Information Age. Never has there</p>
<p class="calibre1">been so great a symbolic triumph of e ciency over power. When the wal s of</p>
<p class="calibre1">San Giovanni fel , it was a stark demonstration that the economic returns to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  in  the  world  had  risen  sharply.  The  fal   of  the  Berlin  Wal   says</p>
<p class="calibre1">something di erent, namely that returns to violence are now fal ing. This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that few have even begun to recognize, but it wil  have dramatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For reasons we explore in this chapter, the Berlin Wal  may prove to be far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more symbolic of the whole era of the industrial nation-state than those in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  crowd  that  night  in  Berlin  or  the  mil ions  watching  from  a  distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood. The Berlin Wal  was built to a very di erent purpose than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wal s of San Giovanni&mdash;to prevent people on the inside from escaping rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than to prevent predators on the outside from entering. That fact alone is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tel ing indicator of the rise in the power of the state from the  fteenth to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth centuries. And in more ways than one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  centuries,  the  nation-state  made  al   outward-facing  wal s  redundant</p>
<p class="calibre1">and unnecessary. The level of monopoly that the state exercised over coercion</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  those  areas  where  it  rst  took  hold  made  them  both  more  peaceful</p>
<p class="calibre1">internal y  and  more  formidable  militarily  than  any  sovereignties  the  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  seen  before.  The  state  used  the  resources  extracted  from  a  largely</p>
<p class="calibre1">disarmed population to crush smal -scale predators. The nation-state became</p>
<p class="calibre1">history’s  most  successful  instrument  for  seizing  resources.  Its  success  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">based upon its superior ability to extract the wealth of its citizens. </p>

<p class="calibre1">nine of ten students agreed that “it’s up to me to get what I want of life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More strikingly, “almost half the teens said they expected to leave the country</p>

<p class="calibre1">campaign  on  MTV,  Bil   Clinton  has  sought  to  make  it  more  di cult  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans to “leave the country of their birth in pursuit of their goals.” In</p>
<p class="calibre1">1995,  at  about  the  same  time  that  the  high  school  students  were  declaring</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  intentions  to  seek  independence,  the  President  of  the  United  States</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed the enactment of an exit tax, a “Berlin Wal  for Capital,” that would</p>
<p class="calibre1">require wealthy Americans to pay a substantial ransom to escape with even</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of their money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton’s ransom is not only reminiscent of the late East German state’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">policy  of  treating  its  citizens  as  assets;  it  also  cal s  to  mind  the  increasingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">draconian  measures  taken  to  shore  up  the  scal  position  of  the  Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire in decline. This passage from  <i class="calibre4">The Cambridge Ancient History</i> tel s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">145</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-121"></a>Thus began the  erce endeavor of the State to squeeze the population to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last drop. Since economic resources fel  short of what was needed, the strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">fought  to  secure  the  chief  share  for  themselves  with  a  violence  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unscrupulousness wel  in keeping with the origin of those in power and with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldiery accustomed to plunder. The ful  rigour of the law was let loose on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">population. Soldiers acted as baili s or wandered as secret police through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">land.  Those  who  su ered  most  were,  of  course,  the  propertied  class.  It  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">relatively easy to lay hands on their property, and in an emergency, they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  class  from  whom  something  could  be  extorted  most  frequently  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly. <a href="#calibre_link-9">5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  failing  systems  have  the  power  to  do  so,  they  often  impose  penal</p>
<p class="calibre1">burdens  upon  those  seeking  to  escape.  Again,  we  quote   <i class="calibre4">The  Cambridge</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Ancient History:</i> “If the propertied class buried their money, or sacri ced two-</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirds of their estate to escape from a magistracy, or went so far as to give up</p>
<p class="calibre1">their whole property in order to get free of the domains rent, and the non-</p>
<p class="calibre1">propertied class ran away, the State replied by increasing the pressure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  worth  remembering  as  you  plan  ahead.  The  twilight  of  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems in the past has seldom been a polite, orderly process. We mentioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">the nasty habits of Roman tax col ectors in Chapter 2. The large numbers of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">agri deserti, </i> or abandoned farms, in Western Europe after the col apse of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roman  Empire  re ected  only  a  smal   part  of  a  wider  problem.  In  fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactions tended to be relatively mild in Gaul, and in the frontier areas that</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprise  current-day  Luxembourg  and  Germany.  In  Rome’s  most  fertile</p>
<p class="calibre1">region,  Egypt,  where  farming  was  more  productive  because  of  irrigation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">desertion by owners was an even bigger problem. The question of whether to</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt escape, the  <i class="calibre4">ultimum refugium, </i> as it was known in Latin, became the</p>
<p class="calibre1">overriding  quandary  of  almost  everyone  with  property.  Records  show  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“among the common questions which used to be put to an oracle in Egypt</p>
<p class="calibre1">three standard types were: ‘Am I to become a beggar?’ ‘Shal  I take to  ight?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ‘Is my  ight to be stopped?’ ” <a href="#calibre_link-9">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton’s proposal says yes. It is an early version of an obstacle to escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is likely to grow more onerous as the  scal resources of the nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">slip away. Of course, the  rst U.S. version of an exit barrier is more benign</p>
<p class="calibre1">than Erich Honecker’s concrete and barbed wire. It also involves greater price</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensitivity, with the burden fal ing only on “bil ionaires” with taxable estates</p>
<p class="calibre1">146</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-336"></a>above $600,000. Nonetheless, it was justi ed with similar arguments to those</p>
<p class="calibre1">once  propounded  by  Honecker  in  defense  of  the  late  German  Democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">Republic’s  most  famous  public  works  project.  Honecker  claimed  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">East  German  state  had  a  substantial  investment  in  would-be  refugees.  He</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed  out  that  al owing  them  to  leave  freely  would  create  an  economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">disadvantage for the state, which required their e orts in East Germany. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you accept the premise that people are or ought to be assets of the state, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honecker’s  wal   made  sense.  Berlin  without  a  wal   was  a  loophole  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communists,  just  as  escape  from  U.S.  tax  jurisdiction  was  a  loophole  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton’s  IRS.  Clinton’s  arguments  about  escaping  bil ionaires,  aside  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">showing  a  politician’s  usual  disregard  for  the  integrity  of  numbers,  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar  in  kind  to  Honecker’s,  but  somewhat  less  logical  because  the  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">government, in fact, does not have a large economic investment in wealthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens  who  might  seek  to  lee.  It  is  not  a  question  of  their  having  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">educated  at  state  expense  and  wanting  to  slip  away  and  practice  law</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere else. The overwhelming majority of those to whom the exit tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">would apply have created their wealth by their own e orts and in spite of, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of, the U.S. government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  top  1  percent  of  taxpayers  paying  30.2  percent  of  the  total</p>
<p class="calibre1">income tax in the United States (1995), it is not a question of the rich failing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to repay any genuine investment the state may have made in their education</p>
<p class="calibre1">or economic prosperity. To the contrary. Those who pay most of the bil s pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">vastly  more  than  the  value  of  any  bene ts  they  receive.  With  an  average</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual  tax  payment  exceeding  $125,000,  taxes  cost  the  top  1  percent  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">American  taxpayers  far  more  than  they  now  realize.  Assuming  they  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">earn even a 10 percent return on the excess tax paid by each over a forty-year</p>
<p class="calibre1">period, each $5,000 of annual excess tax payment reduced their net worth by</p>
<p class="calibre1">$2.2 mil ion. At a 20 percent rate of return, each $5,000 of excess tax reduces</p>
<p class="calibre1">net worth by $44 mil ion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the mil ennium approaches, the new megapolitical conditions of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age  wil   make  it  increasingly  obvious  that  the  nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherited  from  the  industrial  era  is  a  predatory  institution.  With  each  year</p>
<p class="calibre1">that passes, it wil  seem less a boon to prosperity and more an obstacle, one</p>
<p class="calibre1">from which the individual wil  want an escape. It is an escape that desperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  wil   be  loath  to  al ow.  The  stability  and  even  the  survival  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">147</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-316"></a>Western  welfare  states  depends  upon  their  ability  to  continue  extracting  a huge  fraction  of  the  world’s  total  output  for  redistribution  to  a  subset  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">voters in the OECD countries. This requires that the taxes imposed upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  productive  citizens  of  the  currently  rich  countries  be  priced  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">supermonopoly rates, hundreds or even thousands of times higher than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual cost of the services that governments provide in return. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE NATION-STATE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fal  of the Berlin Wal  was more than just a visible symbol of the death of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communism. It was a defeat for the entire world system of nation-states and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  triumph  of  e ciency  and  markets.  The  fulcrum  of  power  underlying</p>
<p class="calibre1">history  has  shifted.  We  believe  that  the  fal   of  the  Berlin  Wal   in  1989</p>
<p class="calibre1">culminates the era of the nation-state, a peculiar two-hundred-year phase in</p>
<p class="calibre1">history  that  began  with  the  French  Revolution.  States  have  existed  for  six</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand years. But before the nineteenth century, they accounted for only a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  fraction of the world’s sovereignties. Their ascendancy began and ended</p>
<p class="calibre1">in revolution. The great events of 1789 launched Europe on a course toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly  national  governments.  The  great  events  of  1989  marked  the  death  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communism  and  an  assertion  of  control  by  market  forces  over  massed</p>
<p class="calibre1">power. Those two revolutions, exactly two hundred years apart, de ne the era</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  which  the  nation-state  predominated  in  the  Great  Power  system.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great  Powers,  in  turn,  dominated  the  world,  spreading  or  imposing  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems on even the most remote tribal enclave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The triumph of the state as the principal vehicle for organizing violence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world was not a matter of ideology. It was necessitated by the hidden logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">of violence. It was, as we like to say, a megapolitical event, determined not so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much by the wishes of theorists and statesmen, or even by the maneuvering</p>
<p class="calibre1">of generals, as by the hidden leverage of violence, which moved history in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way that Archimedes once dreamt of moving the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">States have been the norm for the past two hundred years of the modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">period. But in the longer sweep of history, states have been rare. They have</p>
<p class="calibre1">always  depended  upon  extraordinary  megapolitical  conditions  for  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">viability. Prior to the modern period, most states were “Oriental despotisms,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">agricultural societies in deserts dependent upon control of irrigation systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">148</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-122"></a>for their survival. Even the Roman Empire, through its control of Egypt and</p>
<p class="calibre1">North Africa, was indirectly a hydraulic society. But not enough of one to</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive. Rome, like most premodern states, ultimately lacked the capacity to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compel  adherence  to  the  monopoly  of  violence  that  the  ability  to  starve</p>
<p class="calibre1">people provides. The Roman state outside of Africa could not cut o  water</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  growing  crops  by  denying  unsubmissive  people  access  to  the  irrigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">system. Such hydraulic systems supplied more leverage to violence than any</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  megapolitical  con guration  in  the  ancient  economy.  Whoever</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed  the  water  in  these  societies  could  extract  spoils  at  a  level  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparable  to  the  percentage  of  total  output  absorbed  by  modern  nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states. <a href="#calibre_link-9">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Magnitude over Efficiency</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Gunpowder enabled states to expand more easily outside the con nes of rice</p>
<p class="calibre1">paddies  and  arid  river  val eys.  The  nature  of  gunpowder  weapons  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">character  of  the  industrial  economy  created  great  advantages  of  scale  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">warfare. This led to high and rising returns to violence. As historian Charles</p>
<p class="calibre1">Til y put it, “[S]tates having the largest coercive means tended to win wars; </p>
<p class="calibre1">e ciency (the ratio of output to input) came second to e ectiveness (total</p>
<p class="calibre1">output).” <a href="#calibre_link-9">8 </a>With governments mostly organized on a large scale, even the few</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal   sovereignties  that  survived,  like  Monaco  or  Andorra,  needed  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognition  of  the  larger  states  to  ensure  their  independence.  Only  big</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments with ever-greater command of resources could compete on the</p>

<p class="calibre1">This  brings  us  to  one  of  the  great  unanswered  puzzles  of  modern  history:</p>
<p class="calibre1">why  the  Cold  War  that  came  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Great  Power  system</p>
<p class="calibre1">pitted  as  its  nal  contenders  Communist  dictatorships  against  democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare states. This issue has been so little examined that it actual y seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">plausible  to  many  when  a  State  Department  analyst,  Francis  Fukuyama, </p>
<p class="calibre1">proclaimed “the end of history” after the Berlin Wal  fel . The enthusiastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">audience his work elicited took too much for granted. Apparently neither the</p>
<p class="calibre1">149</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-365"></a>author nor many others had bothered to ask a fundamental question: What</p>
<p class="calibre1">common characteristics of state socialism and welfare-state democracies led</p>
<p class="calibre1">them to be the  nal contenders for world domination? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  an  important  issue.  After  al ,  dozens  of  contending  systems  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty have come and gone in the past  ve centuries, including absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">monarchies,  tribal  enclaves,  prince-bishoprics,  direct  rule  by  the  pope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sultanates, city-states, and Anabaptist colonies. Today, most people would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised to learn that a hospital management company, with its own armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces,  could  rule  a  country  for  centuries.  Yet  something  very  like  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened. For three hundred years after 1228, the Teutonic Knights of St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary’s Hospital at Jerusalem, later united with the Knights of the Sword of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Livonia,  ruled  East  Prussia  and  various  territories  in  Eastern  Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including  parts  of  Lithuania  and  Poland.  Then  came  the  Gunpowder</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution.  Within  decades,  the  Teutonic  Knights  were  expel ed  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereigns  of  al   their  territories  and  their  Grand  Master  was  of  no  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">military importance than a chess champion. Why? Why did so many other</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems of sovereignty dwindle to insigni cance while the great struggle for</p>
<p class="calibre1">world power at the end of the Industrial Age saw mass democracies lined up</p>
<p class="calibre1">against state socialist systems? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Unimpeded Control</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Our theory of megapolitics points to the answer. It is rather like asking why</p>
<p class="calibre1">sumo  wrestlers  tend  to  be  fat.  The  answer  is  that  a  lean  sumo  wrestler, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however  impressive  his  ratio  of  strength  to  weight,  cannot  compete  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">another wrestler who is gigantic. As Til y suggests, the important issue was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“e ectiveness (total output),” not “e ciency (the ratio of output to input).” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an increasingly violent world, the systems that predominated through  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  of  competition  were  necessarily  those  that  facilitated  the  greatest</p>
<p class="calibre1">access to resources needed to make war on a large scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did this work? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of Communism, the answer is obvious. Under Communism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">those who control ed the state control ed almost everything. If you had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">a citizen of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the KGB could have taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  toothbrush  if  they  had  thought  it  useful  for  their  purposes  to  do  so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">150</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-397"></a>They could have taken your teeth. According to credible estimates that have</p>
<p class="calibre1">become more credible since the opening of former Soviet archives in 1992, </p>
<p class="calibre1">secret  police  and  other  agents  of  the  late  Soviet  state  took  the  lives  of  50</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ion persons in seventy-four years of rule. The state socialist system was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  position  to  mobilize  anything  that  existed  within  its  boundaries  for  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">military, with little likelihood that anyone living there would argue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of Western democracies, the story is less obvious, partly because</p>
<p class="calibre1">we are accustomed to think of democracy in stark contrast to Communism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In terms of the Industrial Age, the two systems were indeed great opposites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But seen from the perspective of the Information Age, the two systems had</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  in  common  than  you  might  suspect.  Both  facilitated  unimpeded</p>
<p class="calibre1">control of resources by government. The di erence was that the democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of the state than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state socialist systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a clear-cut example of a rare phenomenon, less being more. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state owned</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything.  The  democratic  welfare  state,  by  contrast,  made  more  modest</p>
<p class="calibre1">claims, and thereby employed superior incentives to mobilize greater output. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of laying claim to everything in the beginning, governments in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">West  al owed  individuals  to  own  property  and  accumulate  wealth.  Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after the wealth had been accumulated, the Western nation-states taxed a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraction of it away. Property taxes, income taxes, and estate taxes at high levels</p>
<p class="calibre1">furnished  the  democratic  welfare  state  with  prodigious  quantities  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources compared to those available through the state socialist systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Inefficiency, Where It Counted</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to Communism, the welfare state was indeed a far more e cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.  But  compared  to  other  systems  for  accumulating  wealth,  such  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine laissez-faire enclave like colonial Hong Kong, the welfare state was</p>
<p class="calibre1">ine cient. Again, less was more. It was precisely this ine ciency that made</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  welfare  state  supreme  during  the  megapolitical  conditions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When you come to understand why, you are much closer to recognizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">what the fal  of the Berlin Wal  and the death of Communism real y mean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">151</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-480"></a>Far  from  assuring  that  the  democratic  welfare  state  wil   be  a  triumphant system, as has been widely assumed, it was more like seeing that a fraternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">twin  has  died  of  old  age.  The  same  megapolitical  revolution  that  kil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communism  is  also  likely  to  undermine  and  destroy  democratic  welfare</p>
<p class="calibre1">states as we have known them in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">WHO CONTROLS GOVERNMENT? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The key to this unorthodox conclusion lies in recognizing where the control</p>
<p class="calibre1">of democratic government is lodged. It is an issue that is not as simple as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">may seem. In the modern era, the question of who controls the government</p>
<p class="calibre1">has almost always been asked as a political question. It has had many answers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but almost uniformly these involved identifying the political party, group, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">faction  that  dominated  the  control  of  a  particular  state  at  a  particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment.  You  have  heard  of  governments  control ed  by  capitalists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments control ed by labor. Governments control ed by Catholics, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Islamic  fundamentalists.  Governments  control ed  by  tribal  and  racial</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups; governments control ed by Hutus and governments by whites. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">have also heard of governments control ed by occupational groups, such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyers  or  bankers.  You  have  heard  of  governments  control ed  by  rural</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests, by big-city machines and by people living in the suburbs. And you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  certainly  heard  of  governments  control ed  by  political  parties,  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Democrats,  Conservatives,  Christian  Democrats,  Liberals,  Radicals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Republicans, and Socialists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But you probably have not heard much about a government control ed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">its customers. Economic historian Frederic Lane laid the basis for a new way</p>
<p class="calibre1">of understanding, where the control of government lies in some of his lucid</p>
<p class="calibre1">essays on the economic consequences of violence discussed earlier. Thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  government  as  an  economic  unit  that  sel s  protection  led  Lane  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">analyze the control of government in economic rather than political terms. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">this view, there are three basic alternatives in the control of government, each</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  which  entails  a  fundamental y  di erent  set  of  incentives:  proprietors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">employees, and customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Proprietors</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">152</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-123"></a>In  rare  cases,  even  today,  governments  are  sometimes  control ed  by  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprietor, usual y a hereditary leader who for al  intents and purposes owns</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  country.  For  example,  the  Sultan  of  Brunei  treats  the  government  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brunei somewhat like a proprietorship. This was more common among lords</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Middle  Ages,  who  treated  their  efs  as  proprietorships  to  optimize</p>
<p class="calibre1">their incomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane described the incentives of “the owners of the production-producing</p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise” as fol ows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">An interest in maximizing pro ts would lead him, while maintaining prices, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to reduce his costs. He would, like Henry VII of England or Louis XI of</p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  use  inexpensive  wiles,  at  least  as  inexpensive  devices  as  possible,  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a rm his legitimacy, to maintain domestic order, and to distract neighboring</p>
<p class="calibre1">princes so that his own military expenses would be low. From lowered costs, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the increased exactions made possible by the  rmness of his monopoly, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a combination, he accumulated a surplus.…” <a href="#calibre_link-9">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments control ed by proprietors have strong incentives to reduce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs of providing protection or monopolizing violence in a given area. But so</p>
<p class="calibre1">long as their rule is secure, they have little incentive to reduce the price (tax)</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  charge  their  customers  below  the  rate  that  optimizes  revenues.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher the price a monopolist can charge, and the lower his actual costs, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  the  pro t  he  wil   make.  The  ideal  scal  policy  for  a  government</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed  by  its  proprietors  would  be  a  huge  surplus.  When  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">can keep their revenues high but cut their costs, this has a large impact on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  of  resources.  Labor  and  other  valuable  inputs  that  would  otherwise  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasted providing unnecessarily expensive protection become available instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  investment  and  other  purposes.  The  higher  the  monarch  can  raise  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pro t by lowering costs, the more resources are freed. When these resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">are used for investment, they provide a stimulus for growth. But even if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  used  for  conspicuous  consumption,  they  help  create  and  feed  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets that otherwise would not exist if the resources had been wasted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce ine cient “protection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Employees</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">153</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-124"></a>It is easy to characterize the incentives that prevail for governments control ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  their  employees.  They  would  be  similar  incentives  in  other  employee-</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed  organizations.  First  and  foremost,  employee-run  organizations</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend  to  favor  any  policy  that  increases  employment  and  oppose  measures</p>
<p class="calibre1">which reduce jobs. As Lane put it, “When employees as a whole control ed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they had little interest in minimizing the amounts exacted for protection and</p>
<p class="calibre1">none in minimizing that large part of costs represented by labor costs, by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own salaries. Maximizing size was more to their taste also. <a href="#calibre_link-9">”10 </a>A government</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed by its employees would seldom have incentives to either reduce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs of government or the price charged to their customers. However, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions impose strong price resistance, in the form of opposition to higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes, governments control ed by employees would be more likely to let their</p>
<p class="calibre1">revenues  fal   below  their  outlays  than  to  cut  their  outlays.  In  other  words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their incentives imply that they may be inclined toward chronic de cits, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments control ed by proprietors would not be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Customers</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Are there examples of governments control ed by their customers? Yes. Lane</p>
<p class="calibre1">was inspired to analyze the control of government in economic terms by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">example of the medieval merchant republics, like Venice. There a group of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholesale  merchants  who  required  protection  e ectively  control ed  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">government for centuries. They were genuinely customers for the protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">service government provided, not proprietors. They paid for the service. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">did  not  seek  to  pro t  from  their  control  of  government’s  monopoly  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence.  If  some  did,  they  were  prevented  from  doing  so  by  the  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers  for  long  periods  of  time.  Other  examples  of  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed by their customers include democracies and republics with limited</p>
<p class="calibre1">franchise,  such  as  the  ancient  democracies,  or  the  American  republic  in  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">founding  period.  At  that  time,  only  those  who  paid  for  the  government, </p>
<p class="calibre1">about 10 percent of the population, were al owed to vote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments control ed by their customers, like those of proprietors, have</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentives  to  reduce  their  operating  costs  as  far  as  possible.  But  unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  control ed  by  either  proprietors  or  employees,  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y control ed by their customers have incentives to hold down the prices</p>
<p class="calibre1">154</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-125"></a>they  charge.  Where  customers  rule,  governments  are  lean  and  general y</p>
<p class="calibre1">unobtrusive, with low operating costs, minimal employment, and low taxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A government control ed by its customers sets tax rates not to optimize the</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount the government can col ect but rather to optimize the amount that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  customers  can  retain.  Like  typical  enterprises  in  competitive  markets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even a monopoly control ed by its customers would be compel ed to move</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward e ciency. It would not be able to charge a price, in the form of taxes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that exceeded costs by more than a bare margin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE ROLE OF DEMOCRACY: VOTERS AS EMPLOYEES AND</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CUSTOMERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane  treats  democracy  in  the  conventional  way  in  assuming  that  it  brings</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence-using  and  violence-producing  enterprises  “increasingly  under  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">control  of  their  customers. <a href="#calibre_link-9">”11  </a>This  is  certainly  the  political y  correct conclusion.  But  is  it  true?  We  think  not.  Look  closely  at  how  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracies function. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  of  al ,  they  have  few  characteristics  of  those  competitive  industries</p>
<p class="calibre1">where the terms of trade are clearly control ed by their customers. For one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, democratic governments typical y spend only a bare fraction of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">total outlays on the service of protection, which is their core activity. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United States, for example, state and local governments spend just 3.5 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their total outlays on the provision of police, as wel  as courts and prisons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Add military spending, and the fraction of revenues devoted to protection is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil   only  about  10  percent.  Another  revealing  hint  that  mass  democracy  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not control ed by its customers is the fact that contemporary political culture, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inherited from the Industrial Age, would consider it outrageous if policies on</p>
<p class="calibre1">crucial issues were actual y informed by the interests of the people who pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bil s. Imagine the uproar if a U.S. president or a British prime minister</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed to al ow the group of citizens who pay the majority of the taxes to</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine  which  programs  of  government  should  continue  and  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups of employees should be  red. This would deeply o end expectations</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  how  government  should  operate,  in  a  way  that  al owing  government</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees to determine whose taxes should be raised would not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">155</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-435"></a>Yet when you think about it, when customers real y are in the driver’s seat</p>
<p class="calibre1">it would be considered outrageous that they should not get what they want. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  went  into  a  store  to  buy  furniture,  and  the  salespeople  took  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">money but then proceeded to ignore your requests and consult others about</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to spend your money, you would quite rightly be upset. You would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  it  normal  or  justi able  if  the  employees  of  the  store  argued  that  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">real y did not deserve the furniture, and that it should be shipped instead to</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone whom they found more worthy. The fact that something very like</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  happens  in  dealings  with  government  shows  how  little  control  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">“customers” actual y have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By any measure, the costs of democratic government have surged out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">control,  unlike  the  typical  situation  where  customer  preferences  force</p>
<p class="calibre1">vendors to be e cient. Most democracies run chronic de cits. This is a  scal</p>
<p class="calibre1">policy  characteristic  of  control  by  employees.  Governments  seem  notably</p>
<p class="calibre1">resistant  to  reducing  the  costs  of  their  operations.  An  almost  universal</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaint  about  contemporary  government  worldwide  is  that  political</p>
<p class="calibre1">programs, once established, can be curtailed only with great di culty. To  re</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  government  employee  is  al   but  impossible.  In  fact,  one  of  the  principal</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages  arising  from  privatization  of  formerly  state-owned  functions  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  private  control  usual y  makes  it  far  easier  to  weed  out  unnecessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">employment. From Britain to Argentina, it has not been uncommon for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new private managers to shed 50-95 percent of former state employees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think, as wel , of the basis upon which the  scal terms of government’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  service  is  priced.  For  the  most  part,  you  would  look  in  vain  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">hints of competitive in uences on tax rates according to which government</p>
<p class="calibre1">services are priced. Even the occasional debates about lowering taxes that have</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted normal political discourse in recent years betray how far removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic  government  has  normal y  been  from  control  by  its  customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advocates of lower taxes sometimes have argued that government revenues</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  actual y  increase  because  rates  previously  had  been  set  so  high  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they discouraged economic activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  trade-o   they  normal y  intended  to  highlight  was  not  competition</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  jurisdictions  but  something  much  more  amazing.  They  did  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">argue that because tax rates in Hong Kong were only 15 percent, rates in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  or  Germany  must  be  no  higher  than  15  percent.  To  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">156</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-366"></a>contrary.  Tax  debates  have  normal y  assumed  that  the  trade-o   facing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxpayer was not between doing business in one jurisdiction or doing it in</p>
<p class="calibre1">another, but between doing business at penal rates or taking a holiday. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  told  that  productive  individuals  subject  to  predatory  taxation  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk away from their in-boxes and go gol ng if their tax burdens were not</p>
<p class="calibre1">eased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that such an argument could even arise shows how far removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  a  competitive  footing  the  protection  costs  imposed  by  democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare  states  have  been.  The  terms  of  progressive  income  taxation,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged in every democratic welfare state during the course of the twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century, are dramatical y unlike pricing provisions that would be preferred by</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers. This can easily be seen by comparing taxation imposed to support</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  monopolistic  provision  of  protection  with  tari s  for  telephone  service, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  until  recently  was  a  monopoly  in  most  places.  Customers  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">scream bloody murder if a telephone company attempted to charge for cal s</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  same  basis  that  income  taxes  are  imposed.  Suppose  the  phone</p>
<p class="calibre1">company  sent  a  bil   for  $50,000  for  a  cal   to  London,  just  because  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened to conclude a deal worth $125,000 during a conversation. Neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">you nor any other customer in his right mind would pay it. But that is exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">the basis upon which income taxes are assessed in every democratic welfare</p>
<p class="calibre1">state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  you  think  closely  about  the  terms  under  which  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracies  have  operated,  it  is  more  logical  to  treat  them  as  a  form  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government control ed by their employees. Thinking of mass democracy as</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  control ed  by  its  employees  helps  explain  the  di culty  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing government policy. Government in many respects appears to be run</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  the  bene t  of  employees.  For  example,  government  schools  in  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic countries seem to malfunction chronical y and without remedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If customers truly were in the driver’s seat, they would  nd it easier to set new</p>
<p class="calibre1">policy directions. Those who pay for democratic government seldom set the</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms of government spending. Instead, government functions as a co-op that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is both outside of proprietary control and operating as a natural monopoly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prices  bear  little  relation  to  costs.  The  quality  of  service  is  general y  low</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared  to  that  in  private  enterprise.  Customer  grievances  are  hard  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">157</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-481"></a>remedy.  In  short,  mass  democracy  leads  to  control  of  government  by  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">“employees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  wait.  You  may  be  saying  that  in  most  jurisdictions  there  are  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">more voters than there are persons on the government payrol . How could it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be possible for employees to dominate under such conditions? The welfare</p>
<p class="calibre1">state emerged to answer exactly this quandary. Since there were not otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough employees to create a working majority, increasing numbers of voters</p>
<p class="calibre1">were e ectively put on the payrol  to receive transfer payments of al  kinds. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ect,  the  recipients  of  transfer  payments  and  subsidies  became  pseudo</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  of  government  who  were  able  to  dispense  with  the  bother  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting every day to work. It was a result dictated by the megapolitical logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the industrial age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the magnitude of coercive force is more important than the e cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">deployment of resources, as was the case prior to 1989, it is al  but impossible</p>
<p class="calibre1">for most governments to be control ed by their customers. As the example of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the late Soviet Union il ustrated so wel , until a few years ago it was possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">for states to exercise great power in the world even while wasting resources on</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  massive  scale.  When  returns  to  violence  are  high  and  rising,  magnitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">means more than e ciency. Larger entities tend to prevail over smal er ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those governments that are more e ective in mobilizing military resources, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even  at  the  cost  of  wasting  many  of  them,  tend  to  prevail  over  those  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">utilize resources more e ciently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think  what  this  means.  It  inescapably  implies  that  when  magnitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">means  more  than  e ciency,  governments  control ed  by  their  customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot prevail, and often, cannot survive. Under such conditions, the entities</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wil  be most e ectively militarily are those that commandeer the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  for  war.  But  governments  that  are  truly  control ed  by  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers who pay their bil s are unlikely to have carte blanche to reach into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pockets of everyone to extract resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Customers  normal y  wish  to  see  the  prices  they  pay  for  any  product  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">service, including protection, lowered and kept under control. If the Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracies had been under customer control during the Cold War, that fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone would have made them weaker competitors militarily, because it would</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  certainly  have  curtailed  the  ow  of  resources  into  the  government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember, where customers rule, both prices and costs should be expected</p>
<p class="calibre1">158</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-419"></a>to  be  under  tight  control.  But  this  is  hardly  what  happened.  The  welfare states were manifestly the winners of the spending contest during the Cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">War.  Commentators  of  al   stripes  cited  as  a  factor  in  their  triumph  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability to spend the Soviet Union into bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is precisely this fact that highlights the way in which the ine ciencies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy  made  it  megapolitical y  predominant  during  a  period  of  rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns to violence. Massive military spending, with al  its waste, represents a</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly  suboptimal  deployment  of  capital  for  private  gain.  We  suggested</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier  that  while  welfare  states  were  economical y  e cient  as  compared  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">state socialist systems, they are far less e cient for the creation of wealth than</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">laissez-faire</i> enclaves, like Hong Kong. Ironical y, it was this very ine ciency</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the democratic welfare state as compared to a more unencumbered free-</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  system  that  made  it  successful&mdash;in  the  megapolitical  conditions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did ine ciency fostered by democracy become a factor in its success</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the Age of Violence? The key to unraveling this apparent paradox lies</p>
<p class="calibre1">in recognizing two points:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Success for a sovereignty in the modern period lay not in creating wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">but in creating a military force capable of deploying overpowering violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">against any other state. Money was needed to do that, but money itself could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  win  a  battle.  The  chal enge  was  not  to  create  a  system  with  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">e cient  economy  or  the  most  rapid  rate  of  growth,  but  to  create  a  system</p>
<p class="calibre1">that could extract more resources and channel them into the military. By its</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature, military spending is an area where the  nancial returns  <i class="calibre4">per se</i> are low</p>
<p class="calibre1">or nonexistent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. The easiest way to obtain permission to invest funds in activities with</p>
<p class="calibre1">little or no direct  nancial return, like tax payments, is to ask for permission</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  someone  other  than  the  person  whose  money  is  coveted.  One  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways  that  the  Dutch  were  able  to  purchase  Manhattan  for  twenty-three</p>
<p class="calibre1">dol ars’ worth of beads is that the particular Indians to whom they made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">o er  were  not  the  ones  who  properly  owned  it.  “Getting  to  yes,”  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketing  people  say,  is  much  easier  under  those  terms.  Suppose,  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">example, that as authors of this book we wanted you to pay not its cover price</p>
<p class="calibre1">but 40 percent of your annual income for a copy. We would be far likelier to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get permission to do so if we asked someone else, and did not have to ask you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">159</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-420"></a>In fact, we would be far more persuasive if we could rely instead upon the</p>
<p class="calibre1">consent of several people you do not even know. We could hold an  <i class="calibre4">ad  hoc</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">election, what H. L. Mencken described, with less exaggeration than he might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  thought,  as  “an  advanced  auction  of  stolen  goods.”  And  to  make  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">example  more  realistic,  we  would  agree  to  share  some  of  the  money  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ected from you with these anonymous bystanders in exchange for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the role the modern democratic welfare state evolved to ful l . It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was an unsurpassed system in the Industrial Age because it was both e cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  ine cient  where  it  counted.  It  combined  the  e ciency  of  private</p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership  and  incentives  for  the  creation  of  wealth  with  a  mechanism  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitate  essential y  unchecked  access  to  that  wealth.  Democracy  kept  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pockets  of  wealth  producers  open.  It  succeeded  militarily  during  the  high-</p>
<p class="calibre1">water  period  of  rising  returns  to  violence  in  the  world  precisely  because  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">made it di cult for customers to e ectively restrict the taxes the government</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ected  or  other  ways  of  funding  the  outlay  of  resources  for  the  military, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such as in ation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Why Customers Could Not Dominate</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  who  paid  for  “protection”  during  the  modern  period  were  not  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">position  to  successful y  deny  resources  to  the  sovereign,  even  acting</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ectively,  when  doing  so  would  simply  have  exposed  them  to  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpowered  by  other,  possibly  more  hostile  states.  This  was  an  obvious</p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration during the Cold War. The customers, or taxpayers, who bore a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disproportionate  share  of  the  cost  of  government  in  the  leading  Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial states were in no position to refuse to pay hefty taxes. The result</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  been  to  expose  themselves  to  total  con scation  by  the  Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union or another aggressive group capable of organizing violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Industrialism and Democracy</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a longer view, mass democracy may prove to be an anachronism that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   not  long  survive  the  end  of  the  Industrial  Age.  Certainly,  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy  and  the  nation-state  emerged  together  with  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">160</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-126"></a>Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, probably as a response to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">surge  in  real  income.  Incomes  had  begun  to  rise  signi cantly  in  Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe about 1750, partly as a result of warmer weather. This coincided with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  period  of  technological  innovation  that  displaced  skil ed  jobs  of  artisans</p>
<p class="calibre1">with equipment that could be operated by unskil ed workers, even women</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  children.  This  new  industrial  equipment  raised  earnings  for  unskil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers, making the income distribution more equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crucial  trigger  point  of  revolution  may  not  have  been,  as  is  often</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought,  the  perverse  idea  that  people  tend  to  revolt  when  conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve. More important may be the fact that when incomes had risen to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain  level,  it  at  last  became  practical  for  the  early-modern  state  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumvent  the  private  intermediaries  and  powerful  magnates  with  whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had previously bargained for resources, and move to a system of “direct</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule” in which a national government dealt directly with individual citizens, </p>
<p class="calibre1">taxing them at ever higher rates and demanding poorly compensated military</p>
<p class="calibre1">service in exchange for provision of various bene ts<a href="#calibre_link-9">.12</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the emerging middle class soon had enough money to tax, it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  longer  essential,  as  it  previously  had  been,  for  rulers  to  negotiate  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful landlords or great merchants who were, as historian Charles Til y</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote, “in a position to prevent the creation of a powerful state” that would</p>
<p class="calibre1">“seize  their  assets  and  cramp  their  transactions. <a href="#calibre_link-9">”13  </a>It  is  easy  to  see  why governments  were  more  successful  in  extracting  resources  when  they  dealt</p>
<p class="calibre1">with mil ions of citizens individual y rather than with a relative handful of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lords,  dukes,  earls,  bishops,  contract  mercenaries,  free  cities,  and  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">semisovereign entities with whom the rulers of European states were obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">to negotiate prior to the mid-eighteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising real incomes al owed governments to adopt a strategy that placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">more resources under their control. Smal  sums taken in taxes from mil ions</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  produce  more  revenue  than  larger  amounts  paid  by  a  few  powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. What is more, the many were far easier to deal with than the few, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were general y unwil ing to give their money away and were far better placed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to resist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  al ,  the  typical  farmer,  smal   merchant,  or  worker  possessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanishingly  smal   resources  as  compared  to  the  state  itself.  It  was  not  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">remotely possible that the typical private individual in Western Europe on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">161</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-127"></a>eve of the French Revolution could have e ectively bargained with the state</p>
<p class="calibre1">to reduce his tax rate, or mounted an e ective resistance to government plans</p>
<p class="calibre1">and policies that threatened his interests. But this is precisely what powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">private  magnates  had  done  for  centuries  and  would  continue  to  do.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ectively  resisted  and  bargained  with  rulers,  restraining  their  ability  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandeer resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Going to war accelerated the move from indirect to direct rule. Almost any state</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;CHARLES TILLY</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  example  of  Poland  in  the  mid-eighteenth  century  il ustrates  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly.  In  1760,  the  Polish  national  army  comprised  eighteen  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldiers.  This  was  a  meager  force  compared  to  the  armies  commanded  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">rulers of neighboring Austria, Prussia, and Russia, the least of whom could</p>
<p class="calibre1">control a standing army of 100,000 soldiers. In fact, the Polish national army</p>
<p class="calibre1">in 1760 was smal  even in comparison with other units under arms within</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland.  The  combined  forces  of  the  Polish  nobility  were  thirty  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">men. <a href="#calibre_link-9">15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">If  the  Polish  king  had  been  able  to  interact  directly  with  mil ions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual Poles and tax them directly, rather than being limited to extracting</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  indirectly  through  the  contributions  of  the  powerful  Polish</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnates, there is little doubt that the Polish central government would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been in a position to raise far more revenues, and thus pay for a larger army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Against ordinary individuals, who were not in a position to act in concert</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  mil ions  of  other  ordinary  individuals,  the  central  authorities  were  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove  irresistibly  powerful  everywhere.  But  the  king  of  Poland  lacked  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">option  of  directly  taxing  his  citizens  in  1760.  He  had  to  deal  through  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lords,  wealthy  merchants,  and  other  notables,  who  were  a  smal ,  cohesive</p>
<p class="calibre1">group.  They  could  and  did  act  in  concert  to  keep  the  king  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandeering their resources without their consent. Given that the Polish</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobility had far more troops than he did, the king was in no position to insist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">162</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-128"></a>As  it  turned  out,  the  military  disadvantage  of  failing  to  circumvent  the wealthy  and  powerful  in  gathering  resources  was  decisive  in  the  Age  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Violence.  Within  a  few  years,  Poland  ceased  to  exist  as  an  independent</p>
<p class="calibre1">country.  It  was  conquered  by  invasions  from  Austria,  Prussia,  and  Russia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">three  countries  with  armies  each  of  which  was  many  times  bigger  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poland’s smal  force. In each of those countries, the rulers had found paths to</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumvent the capacity of the wealthy merchants and the nobility to limit</p>
<p class="calibre1">the commandeering of their resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">After the French Revolution</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The French Revolution resulted in an even greater surge in the size of armies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a fact that demonstrated the strength of the democratic strategy when returns</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  violence  were  rising.  The  bargain  governments  struck  from  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution onward was to provide an unprecedented degree of involvement</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the lives of average people, in exchange for their participation in wars in</p>
<p class="calibre1">place of mercenaries, and paying a growing burden of taxes from their rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Til y said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The state’s sphere expanded far beyond its military core, and its citizens began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  make  claims  on  it  for  a  very  wide  range  of  protection,  adjudication, </p>
<p class="calibre1">production,  and  distribution.  As  national  legislatures  extended  their  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">ranges wel  beyond the approval of taxation, they became the targets of claims</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  al   wel -organized  groups  whose  interests  the  state  did  or  could  a ect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Direct rule and mass national politics grew up together, and reinforced each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other mightily. <a href="#calibre_link-9">16</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The same logic that was true in the eighteenth century remained true until</p>
<p class="calibre1">1989, when the Berlin Wal  fel . As the Industrial Age advanced, incomes for</p>
<p class="calibre1">unskil ed  work  continued  to  rise,  making  mass  democracy  an  even  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective  method  of  optimizing  the  extraction  of  resources.  As  a  result, </p>
<p class="calibre1">government grew and grew, adding about 0.5 percent to its total claims on</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual income in the average industrial country over the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the Industrial Age prior to 1989, democracy emerged as the most</p>
<p class="calibre1">militarily e ective form of government precisely because democracy made it</p>
<p class="calibre1">163</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-129"></a>di cult  or  impossible  to  impose  e ective  limits  on  the  commandeering  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources by the state. Generous provision of welfare bene ts to one and al</p>
<p class="calibre1">invited  a  majority  of  voters  to  become,  in  e ect,  employees  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">government.  This  became  the  predominant  political  feature  of  al   leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  countries  because  voters  were  in  a  weak  position  to  e ectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">control  the  government  in  their  role  as  customers  for  the  service  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection.  Not  only  did  they  face  the  aggressive  menace  of  Communist</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems, which could produce large resources for military purposes since the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state control ed the entire economy, but true taxpayer control of government</p>
<p class="calibre1">was also impractical for another reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mil ions  of  average  citizens  cannot  work  together  e ectively  to  protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  interests.  Because  the  obstacles  to  their  cooperation  are  high,  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">return  to  any  individual  for  successful y  defending  the  group’s  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests is minimal, mil ions of ordinary citizens wil  not be as successful in</p>
<p class="calibre1">withholding  their  assets  from  the  government  as  wil   smal er  groups  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">more favorable incentives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other things being equal, therefore, you would expect a higher proportion</p>
<p class="calibre1">of total resources to be commandeered by government in a mass democracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  in  an  oligarchy,  or  in  a  system  of  fragmented  sovereignty  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnates  wielded  military  power  and  elded  their  own  armies,  as  they  did</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere in early-modern Europe prior to the eighteenth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus  a  crucial  though  seldom  examined  reason  for  the  growth  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy  in  the  Western  world  is  the  relative  importance  of  negotiation</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs at a time when returns to violence were rising. It was always costlier to</p>
<p class="calibre1">draw resources from the few than from the many. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  relatively  smal ,  elite  group  of  rich  represent  a  more  coherent  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective  body  than  a  large  mass  of  citizens.  The  smal   group  has  stronger</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentives  to  work  together.  It  wil   almost  inevitably  be  more  e ective  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">protecting its interests than wil  a mass group. <a href="#calibre_link-9">17</a> And even if most members</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the group choose not to cooperate with any common action, a few who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich may be capable of deploying enough resources to get the job done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With democratic decision-making, the nation-state could exercise power</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  more  completely  over  mil ions  of  persons,  who  could  not  easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate to act col ectively in their own behalf, than it could in dealings with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a much smal er number who could more easily overcome the organizational</p>
<p class="calibre1">164</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-482"></a>di culties of defending their concentrated interests. Democracy had the stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  compel ing  advantage  of  creating  a  legitimizing  decision  rule  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">al owed  the  state  to  tap  the  resources  of  the  wel -to-do  without  having  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bargain  directly  for  their  permission.  In  short,  democracy  as  a  decision</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism was wel   tted to the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age.  It  complemented  the  nation-state  because  it  facilitated  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration of military power in the hands of those running it at a time</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the magnitude of force brought to bear was more important than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ciency with which it was mobilized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  demonstrated  decisively  with  the  French  Revolution,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised  the  magnitude  of  military  force  on  the  battle eld.  Thereafter,  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  nation-states  had  little  choice  but  to  converge  on  a  similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization, with legitimacy ultimately tied to democratic decision-making. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To summarize, the democratic nation-state succeeded during the past two</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries for these hidden reasons:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. There were rising returns to violence that made magnitude of force more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important than e ciency as a governing principle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Incomes rose su ciently above subsistence that it became possible for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state  to  col ect  large  amounts  of  total  resources  without  having  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiate with powerful magnates who were capable of resisting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Democracy  proved  su ciently  compatible  with  the  operation  of  free</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets  to  be  conducive  to  the  generation  of  increasing  amounts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Democracy  facilitated  domination  of  government  by  its  “employees,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">thereby  assuring  that  it  would  be  di cult  to  curtail  expenditures, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including military expenditures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Democracy  as  a  decision-rule  proved  to  be  an  e ective  antidote  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability of the wealthy to act in concert to restrict the nation-state’s ability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to tax or otherwise protect their assets from invasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Democracy  became  the  militarily  winning  strategy  because  it  facilitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  gathering  of  more  resources  into  the  hands  of  the  state.  Compared  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  styles  of  sovereignty  that  depended  for  their  legitimacy  on  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">principles,  such  as  the  feudal  levy,  the  divine  right  of  kings,  corporate</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  duty,  or  the  voluntary  contributions  of  the  rich,  mass  democracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">165</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-130"></a>became  militarily  the  most  potent  because  it  was  the  surest  way  to  gather resources in an industrial economy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;JOSEP R. LLOBERA</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Nationalism</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Much the same can be said of nationalism, which became a corol ary to mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy.  States  that  could  employ  nationalism  found  that  they  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">mobilize  larger  armies  at  a  smal er  cost.  Nationalism  was  an  invention  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">enabled a state to increase the scale at which it was militarily e ective. Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics itself, nationalism is mostly a modern invention. As sociologist Josep</p>
<p class="calibre1">Llobera has shown in his richly documented book on the rise of nationalism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the nation is an imagined community that in large measure came into being</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a way of mobilizing state power during the French Revolution. As he puts</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, “In the modern sense of the term, national consciousness has only existed</p>
<p class="calibre1">since the French Revolution, since the time when in 1789 the Constituent</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assembly equated the people of France with the French nation.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">19</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nationalism made it easier to mobilize power and control large numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  people.  Nation-states  formed  by  underlining  and  emphasizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics  that  people  held  in  common,  particularly  spoken  language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This facilitated rule without the intervention of intermediaries. It simpli ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  tasks  of  bureaucracy.  Edicts  that  need  only  be  promulgated  in  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">language can be dispatched more quickly and with less confusion than those</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  must  be  translated  into  a  Babel  of  tongues.  Nationalism,  therefore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tended to lower the cost of control ing larger areas. Before nationalism, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early-modern state required the aid of lords, dukes, earls, bishops, free cities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and other corporate and ethnic intermediaries, from tax “farmers” to military</p>
<p class="calibre1">166</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-131"></a>contract  merchants  and  mercenaries  to  col ect  revenues,  raise  troops  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct other government functions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nationalism  also  decisively  lowered  the  costs  of  mobilizing  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">personnel by encouraging group identi cation with the interests of the state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  such  a  substantial  advantage  in  harnessing  group  feeling  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests of the state that most states, even the al egedly internationalist Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union, converged on nationalism as a complementary ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen  in  a  longer  perspective,  nationalism  is  as  much  an  anomaly  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state  itself.  As  historian  Wil iam  McNeil   has  documented,  polyethnic</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignties were the norm in the past. <a href="#calibre_link-10">20</a> In McNeil ’s words, “The idea that</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  government  rightful y  should  rule  only  over  citizens  of  a  single  ethnos</p>
<p class="calibre1">started to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">21</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">An  early  nationalist  entity  was  the  Prussian  League  (Preussicher  Bund), </p>
<p class="calibre1">which formed in 1440 in opposition to rule by the Teutonic Order. Some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the characteristics of the order were highlighted earlier as a polar example of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  unlike  the  nation-state.  The  Teutonic  Order  was  a  kind  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">chartered company almost none of whose members were native to Prussia. Its</p>
<p class="calibre1">headquarters shifted at various times from Bremen and Lübeck to Jerusalem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Acre to Venice and on to Marienberg on the Vistula. At one time it ruled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  district  of  Burzenland  in  Transylvania.  It  is  not  surprising  that  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  so  unlike  a  state  would  became  the  object  of  one  of  the  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts  to  mobilize  national  feeling  as  a  factor  in  organizing  power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as an indication of how di erent early nationalism was from later</p>
<p class="calibre1">varieties, the German-speaking nobles of the Prussian League petitioned the</p>
<p class="calibre1">king of Poland to place Prussia under Polish rule, largely because even then</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Polish king was a relatively weak monarch who was not expected to rule</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the same rigor as the Teutonic Order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nationalism,  in  its  early  incarnations,  came  into  play  just  prior  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gunpowder  Revolution.  It  continued  to  develop  as  the  early-modern  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">developed, taking a quantum leap in importance at the time of the French</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution. We believe that nationalism as an idea of force has already begun</p>
<p class="calibre1">to recede. It probably reached its heyday with Woodrow Wilson’s attempt to</p>
<p class="calibre1">endow every ethnic group in Europe with its own state at the close of World</p>
<p class="calibre1">War I. It is now a reactionary force, in amed in places with fal ing incomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and declining prospects like Serbia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">167</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-391"></a>As we explore later, we expect nationalism to be a major ral ying theme of</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons with low skil s nostalgic for compulsion as the welfare state col apses</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Western democracies. You haven’t seen anything yet. For most persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the West the fal out from the death of Communism has seemed relatively</p>
<p class="calibre1">benign.  You  have  seen  a  drop  in  military  spending,  a  plunge  in  aluminum</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices, and a new source of hockey players for the NHL. That is the good</p>
<p class="calibre1">news. It is news that most people who came of age in the twentieth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  applaud,  especial y  if  they  are  hockey  fans.  Most  of  the  news  that  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined to prove less popular is stil  to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the passage of the Industrial Age, the megapolitical conditions that</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy satis ed are rapidly ceasing to exist. Therefore, it is doubtful that</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  democracy  and  the  welfare  state  wil   survive  long  in  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical conditions of the Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Congress was not a temple of democracy, it was a market for bartering laws.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;ALBERTO FUJIMORI, president of Peru</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  future  historians  may  report  that  we  have  already  seen  the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">postmodern  coup&mdash;the  remarkable  padlocking  of  the  congress  in  Peru  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1993. This was hardly an event that attracted much favorable notice in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading  industrial  democracies.  But  it  may  turn  out  to  mean  more  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ful ness of time than conventional analysts would suggest. The few who have</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought about it tend to see it as just another power grab of the kind that has</p>
<p class="calibre1">become depressingly familiar in the history of Latin America. But we see it as</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps  the  rst  step  toward  delegitimizing  a  form  of  governance  whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate  megapolitical  reason  for  being  has  begun  to  disappear  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition  to  the  Information  Age.  Fujimori’s  closure  of  the  congress  is  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">symptom  of  the  ultimate  devaluation  of  political  promises.  A  similar  fate</p>
<p class="calibre1">could await other legislatures when their credit is exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  shift  in  technology  that  is  eroding  industrialism  has  trapped  many</p>

<p class="calibre1">grind  out  laws  that  might  have  been  merely  stupid  fty  years  ago  but  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous today. This was spectacularly obvious in Peru, where the internal</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;HERNANDO DE SOTO</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Peru in Ruins</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In a sense, Peru was no longer a modern nation-state in 1993. It stil  had a  ag</p>
<p class="calibre1">and an army, but most of its institutions lay in ruins. Even the prisons had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  taken  over  by  the  inmates.  This  disintegration  could  be  traced  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">number of causes, but most expert attempts to explain it miss the real point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peru was an early casualty of the technological change that is making closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies  dysfunctional  and  undermining  central  authority  everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  megapolitical  stresses  are  compounded  because  decision-making</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions like the Peruvian congress are trapped by perverse incentives into</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggravating the very problems that they most need to solve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Representative  democracy  in  Peru  was  like  a  pair  of  loaded  dice.  As  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision mechanism for aggrandizing the state, it was unsurpassed. But when</p>
<p class="calibre1">new circumstances cal ed for devolving power, the inherent biases that made</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy  so  useful  under  the  old  megapolitical  conditions  made  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasingly dysfunctional. The very laws passed by the congress were rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying any foundation of value or respect for the law. As de Soto put it in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The  Other  Path, </i>  “Smal   interest  groups  ght  among  themselves,  cause</p>
<p class="calibre1">bankruptcies,  implicate  public  o cials.  Governments  hand  out  privileges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The law is used to give and take away far more than morality permits. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”23 </a>A</p>
<p class="calibre1">congress like that in Peru, entirely in thral  to special-interest groups, has al</p>
<p class="calibre1">the moral stature of a gang of fences auctioning o  stolen goods. It made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">free  market  il egal,  and  consequently  made  the  law  ridiculous.  As  de  Soto</p>
<p class="calibre1">writes of the pre-Fujimori period:</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  complete  subversion  of  ends  and  means  has  turned  the  life  of  Peruvian</p>
<p class="calibre1">society upside down, to the point that there are acts which, although o cial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal, are no longer condemned by the col ective consciousness. Smuggling</p>
<p class="calibre1">169</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-133"></a>is a case in point. Everyone, from the aristocratic lady to the humblest man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">acquires smuggled goods. No one has scruples about it; on the contrary, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewed as a kind of chal enge to individual ingenuity or as revenge against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  in ltration  of  violence  and  criminality  into  everyday  life  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied  by  increasing  poverty  and  deprivation.  In  general  terms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peruvians’ real average income had declined steadily over the last ten years and</p>
<p class="calibre1">is now at the level of twenty years ago. Mountains of garbage pile up on al</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides.  Night  and  day,  legions  of  beggars,  car  washers,  and  scavengers  besiege</p>
<p class="calibre1">passersby,  asking  for  money.  The  mental y  il   swarm  naked  in  the  streets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stinking of urine. Children, single mothers, and cripples beg for alms on every</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…The traditional centralism of our society has proved clearly incapable of</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfying the manifold needs of a country in transition. <a href="#calibre_link-10">24</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">De Soto described the abandonment of the grotesque legal economy for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the black market that was under way before Fujimori padlocked the congress</p>
<p class="calibre1">as “an invisible revolution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  are  positive  about  the  bene ts  of  the  free  market,  but  much  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive about the promise of a society in which the law is as degraded as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">money.  The  world  that  de  Soto  described  in  Peru  prior  to  1993  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clockwork  Orange”  world,  where  overly  centralized  and  dysfunctional</p>
<p class="calibre1">government institutions were literal y destroying the civil society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  what  Fujimori  set  out  to  change.  He  had  slashed  in ation  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning o  the printing presses. He had also managed to  re  fty thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  employees,  and  to  trim  some  subsidies.  He  had  made  a  start</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  balancing  the  budget.  His  program  of  reform  included</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehensive plans to create free markets and privatize industry. But as in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  former  Soviet  Union,  most  of  the  important  elements  of  Fujimori’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">reform were yet to be adopted in 1993, including the  rst round of large-scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">privatization  of  state  banks,  mining  companies,  and  utilities.  Instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">enacting these necessary proposals, Peru’s congress, like the Russian congress</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  chal enged  Yeltsin’s  reforms  in  Moscow,  sought  to  move  backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  plan:  restore  subsidies  from  an  empty  treasury,  pad  the  payrol ,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">protect any and al  vested interests, especial y the bureaucracy&mdash;exactly what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you would expect of a government control ed by its employees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">170</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-337"></a>Fujimori claimed that the congress of Peru was dithering and corrupt, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact  with  which  almost  everyone  agreed.  He  further  claimed  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">congressional dithering and corruption made it impossible to reform Peru’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apsing  economy  or  combat  a  violent  assault  by  narco-terrorists  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nihilistic Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerril as. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The 70 Percent Solution</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So Fujimori closed the Congress, an act that might have indicated that he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">as authoritarian as many earlier Latin American leaders. But we thought, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">said  so  at  the  time,  that  Fujimori  had  correctly  identi ed  a  fundamental</p>
<p class="calibre1">impediment  to  reform.  The  extravagant  o cial  elegies  for  the  Peruvian</p>
<p class="calibre1">congress by American editorial writers and o cials of the State Department</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not shared by the people of Peru. While North Americans carried on as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if  Peru’s  congress  were  the  incarnation  of  freedom  and  civilization,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peruvian people cheered. President Fujimori’s popularity shot up above 70</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent  when  he  sent  the  congress  home.  And  he  was  later  reelected  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second term in a landslide. Most citizens apparently saw their legislature more</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  an  obstacle  to  their  wel -being  than  as  an  expression  of  their  rights,  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">1994, real economic growth in Peru reached 12.9 percent, the highest on the</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Deflation of Political Promises</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  saw  Peru’s  turmoil  less  as  a  throwback  to  the  dictatorships  of  the  past</p>
<p class="calibre1">than as an early instal ment of a broader transition crisis. You can expect to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see  crises  of  misgovernment  in  many  countries  as  political  promises  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">de ated  and  governments  run  out  of  credit.  Ultimately,  new  institutional</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms wil  have to emerge that are capable of preserving freedom in the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological conditions, while at the same time giving expression and life to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the common interests that al  citizens share. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few have begun to think about the incompatibility between some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions of industrial government and the megapolitics of postindustrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">society.  Whether  these  contradictions  are  explicitly  acknowledged  or  not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, their consequences wil  become increasingly obvious as examples of</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-483"></a>political  failure  compound  around  the  world.  Institutions  of  government</p>

<p class="calibre1">When the Berlin Wal  fel  in 1989, it not only signaled the end of the Cold</p>

<p class="calibre1">On December 30, 1936, auto workers angling for higher pay forcibly seized</p>
<p class="calibre1">two of General Motors’ main plants at Flint, Michigan. They idled machines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">turned o  the assembly lines, and made themselves at home. Workers who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  been  employed  to  operate  the  factories  sat  down  in  an  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">confrontation that was to last for many weeks. It was a drama punctuated by</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent  riots  and  the  uctuating  al egiances  of  the  police,  the  Michigan</p>
<p class="calibre1">militia, and political  gures at al  levels of government. Seeing little progress</p>
<p class="calibre1">in forcing their demands, the union struck again on February 1, 1937. Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">activists  forcibly  took  over  GM’s  Chevrolet  factory  in  Flint.  By  occupying</p>
<p class="calibre1">and closing General Motors’ key factories, the workers e ectively paralyzed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the company’s productive capacity. In the ten days fol owing the seizure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the third plant, GM produced only 153 automobiles in the United States. </p>

<p class="calibre1">funeral  pyramids  for  the  pharaohs.  While  labor  unions  and  their  tactics  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">intimidation  became  so  familiar  in  the  industrial  period  as  to  be  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unquestioned  part  of  the  social  landscape,  they  depended  upon  special</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  conditions  that  are  rapidly  fading  away.  There  wil   be  no</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;THOMAS HOBBES</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Extortion and Protection</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout history, violence has been a dagger pointed at the heart of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy.  As  Thomas  Schel ing  shrewdly  put  it,  “The  power  to  hurt&mdash;to</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy things that somebody treasures, to in ict pain and grief&mdash;is a kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bargaining power, not easy to use but used often. In the underworld it is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">basis for blackmail, extortion, and kidnapping, in the commercial world, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">boycotts,  strikes,  and  lockouts.…  It  is  often  the  basis  for  discipline,  civilian</p>
<p class="calibre1">and military; and gods use it to exact discipline.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">3 </a>A government’s capacity to tax  ultimately  depends  upon  the  same  vulnerabilities  as  do  private</p>
<p class="calibre1">shakedowns  and  extortion.  Although  we  tend  not  to  perceive  it  in  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms,  the  proportion  of  assets  that  are  control ed  and  spent  coercively, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through  crime  and  government,  provides  a  rough  measure  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical balance between extortion and protection. If technology made</p>
<p class="calibre1">the protection of assets di cult, crime would tend to be widespread, and so</p>
<p class="calibre1">would union activity. Under such circumstances, protection by government</p>
<p class="calibre1">would therefore command a premium. Taxes would be high. Where taxes are</p>
<p class="calibre1">174</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-367"></a>lower and wage rates in the workplace are determined by market forces rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  through  political  intervention  or  coercion,  technology  has  tipped  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">balance toward protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The technological imbalance between extortion and protection reached an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme  at  the  end  of  the  third  quarter  of  the  twentieth  century.  In  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">advanced  Western  societies  more  than  a  majority  of  resources  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandeered  by  governments.  The  incomes  of  a  large  fraction  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">population  were  either  set  by  at  or  determined  under  the  in uence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">coercion,  such  as  by  strikes  and  threats  of  violence  in  other  forms.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare state and the trade union were both artifacts of technology, sharing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spoils of the triumph of power over e ciency in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They could not have existed if not for the technologies, military and civilian, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that raised the returns to violence during the Industrial Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  capacity  to  create  assets  has  always  entailed  some  vulnerability  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">extortion. The greater the assets created or possessed, the higher the price to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be paid, in one way or another. Either you paid o  everyone who gained the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leverage  to  employ  violence  for  extortion,  or  you  paid  for  military  power</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable of defeating any shakedown attempt by brute force. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">borders</i>…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Mathematics of Protection</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the dagger of violence could soon be blunted. Information technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">promises to alter dramatical y the balance between protection and extortion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">making protection of assets in many cases much easier, and extortion more</p>
<p class="calibre1">di cult. The technology of the Information Age makes it possible to create</p>
<p class="calibre1">assets  that  are  outside  the  reach  of  many  forms  of  coercion.  This  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">asymmetry between protection and extortion rests upon a fundamental truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of mathematics. It is easier to multiply than to divide. As basic as this truth is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, its far-reaching consequences were disguised prior to the advent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">microprocessors.  High-speed  computers  have  facilitated  many  bil ions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">times more computations in the past decade than were undertaken in al  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous history of the world. This leap in computation has al owed us for</p>
<p class="calibre1">175</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-14"></a>the  rst time to fathom some of the universal characteristics of complexity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  the  computers  show  is  that  complex  systems  can  be  built  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood only from the bottom up. Multiplying prime numbers is simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But disaggregating complexity by trying to decompose the product of large</p>
<p class="calibre1">prime numbers is al  but impossible. Kevin Kel y, editor of  <i class="calibre4">Wired, </i> puts it this</p>
<p class="calibre1">way: “To multiply several prime numbers into a larger product is easy; any</p>
<p class="calibre1">elementary school kid can do it. But the world’s supercomputers choke while</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to unravel a product into its simple primes.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Logic of Complex Systems</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The cybereconomy wil  inevitably be shaped by this profound mathematical</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth.  It  already  has  an  obvious  expression  in  powerful  encryption</p>
<p class="calibre1">algorithms. As we explore later in this chapter, these algorithms wil  al ow the</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation of a new, protected realm of cybercommerce in which the leverage of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  wil   be  greatly  reduced.  The  balance  between  extortion  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  wil   tip  dramatical y  in  the  direction  of  protection.  This  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitate the emergence of an economy that depends more upon spontaneous</p>
<p class="calibre1">adaptive mechanisms and less upon conscious decision-making and resource</p>
<p class="calibre1">al ocation through bureaucracy. The new system in which protection wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  forefront  wil   be  very  di erent  from  that  which  arose  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominance of compulsion in the industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Command-and-Control Systems Are Primitive</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We wrote in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i> that the computer is enabling us to “see” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the formerly invisible complexity inherent in a whole range of systems<a href="#calibre_link-11">.I </a>Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only does advanced computational capability enable us to better understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  dynamics  of  complex  systems;  it  also  enables  us  to  harness  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">complexities in productive ways. In a sense, this is not even a choice but an</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitability if the economy is to advance beyond the in exible central-control</p>
<p class="calibre1">stage  of  development.  Such  a  system,  which  depends  upon  linear</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationships,  is  fundamental y  primitive.  Government  appropriation</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably  dragoons  resources  from  high-value  complex  uses  to  low-value</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive  uses.  It  is  a  process  that  is  limited  by  the  same  mathematical</p>
<p class="calibre1">176</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-136"></a>asymmetry  that  prevents  the  unraveling  of  the  product  of  large  prime</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers. Dividing the spoils can never be anything but primitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Everything Gets More Complex</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere  you  look  in  the  universe,  you  see  systems  attaining  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">complexity as they evolve. This is true in astrophysics. It is true in a puddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leave rainwater alone in a low spot and it wil  grow more complex. Advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems of every variety are complex adaptive systems without an authority in</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge. Every complex system in nature, of which the market economy is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  evident  social  manifestation,  depends  upon  dispersed  capabilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Systems  that  work  most  e ectively  under  the  widest  range  of  conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">depend for their resilience upon spontaneous order that accommodates novel</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities.  Life  itself  is  such  a  complex  system.  Bil ions  of  potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">combinations  of  genes  produce  a  single  human  individual.  Sorting  among</p>
<p class="calibre1">them would confound any bureaucracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty- ve years ago, that could only have been an intuition. Today it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrable.  The  closer  computers  bring  us  to  understanding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mathematics  of  arti cial  life,  the  better  we  understand  the  mathematics  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">real life, which are those of biological complexity. These secrets of complexity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">harnessed  through  information  technology,  are  al owing  economies  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">recon gured  into  more  complex  forms.  The  Internet  and  the  World  Wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">Web have already taken on characteristics of an organic system, as Kevin Kel y</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggests in  <i class="calibre4">Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the  Economic  World<a href="#calibre_link-10">. </a></i><a href="#calibre_link-10"> 5</a>  In  his  words,  nature  is  “an  idea  factory.  Vital, postindustrial paradigms are hidden in every jungly ant hil .… The wholesale</p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer of bio-logic into machines should  l  us with awe. When the union</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the born and the made is complete, our fabrications wil  learn, adapt, heal</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves, and evolve. This is a power we have hardly dreamt of yet. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  the  consequences  of  the  “wholesale  transfer  of  bio-logic  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines”  are  bound  to  be  far-reaching.  There  has  always  been  a  strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">tendency  for  social  systems  to  mimic  the  characteristics  of  prevailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology.  This  is  something  that  Marx  got  right.  Gigantic  factories</p>
<p class="calibre1">coincided with the age of big government. Microprocessing is miniaturizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions. If our analysis is correct, the technology of the Information Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">177</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-137"></a>wil  ultimately create an economy better suited to exploit the advantages of</p>
<p class="calibre1">complexity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the megapolitical dimensions of such a change are so little understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  even  most  of  those  who  have  recognized  its  mathematical  importance</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  done  so  in  an  anachronistic  way.  It  is  simply  di cult  to  grasp  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">internalize ful y the likelihood that technological change in the next few years</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  antiquate most of the political forms and concepts of the modern world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, the late physicist Heinz Pagels wrote in his farseeing book,  <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dreams of Reason, </i> “I am convinced that the nations and people who master</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  science  of  Complexity  wil   become  the  economic,  cultural,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political superpowers of the next century.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">7 </a>It is an impressive forecast. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">we  believe  it  is  bound  to  be  wrong,  not  because  it  is  misperceived,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  because  it  wil   prove  more  right  than  Dr.  Pagels  dared  to  express. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Societies  that  recon gure  themselves  to  become  more  complex  adaptive</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems  wil   indeed  prosper.  But  when  they  do,  they  are  unlikely  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations,  much  less  “political  superpowers.”  The  more  likely  immediate</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ciaries of increased complexity of social systems wil  be the Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals of the new mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Pagels’s forecast stands, it is the equivalent to a shaman of a hunting</p>
<p class="calibre1">band of  ve hundred generations ago tel ing his men as they crouched around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the camp re, “I am convinced that the  rst hunting band to master the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">science  of  irrigated  planting  wil   have  more  free  time  for  storytel ing  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">even those guys over at the lake who catch the big  sh.” As right as he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the importance of complexity, Pagels overlooked the most basic fact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">al . When the logic of violence changes, society changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE LOGIC OF VIOLENCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To see how and why, it is necessary to focus on several facets of megapolitics</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  are  seldom  brought  to  your  attention.  These  are  issues  that  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">explored  by  historian  Frederic  C.  Lane,  whose  work  on  violence  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic meaning of war is discussed elsewhere in this volume. When Lane</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrote in the middle of this century, the Information Society was nowhere in</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight.  Under  the  circumstances,  he  may  wel   have  supposed  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition to employ violence in the world had reached its  nal stage with</p>
<p class="calibre1">178</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-138"></a>the  appearance  of  the  nation-state.  There  is  no  hint  in  his  works  that  he anticipated microprocessing or believed that it was technological y feasible to</p>
<p class="calibre1">create  assets  in  cyberspace,  a  realm  without  physical  existence.  Lane  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing to say about the implications of the possibility that large amounts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce could be made al  but immune from the leverage of violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Lane did not foresee the technological revolutions now unfolding, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his insights into the various stages of the monopolization of violence in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past  were  so  lucid  that  they  have  obvious  application  to  the  emerging</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Revolution. Lane’s study of the violent medieval world attracted</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  attention  to  issues  that  conventional  economists  and  historians  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended to neglect. He saw that how violence is organized and control ed plays</p>
<p class="calibre1">a large role in determining “what uses are made of scarce resources. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”8 </a>Lane</p>
<p class="calibre1">also recognized that while production of violence is not usual y considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of economic output, the control of violence is crucial to the economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The primary role of government is to provide protection against violence. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">he put it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  economic  enterprise  needs  and  pays  for  protection,  protection  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the destruction or armed seizure of its capital and the forceful disruption of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">labor. In highly organized societies the production of this utility, protection, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of the functions of a special association or enterprise cal ed government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  one  of  the  most  distinctive  characteristics  of  governments  is  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt to create law and order by using force themselves and by control ing</p>
<p class="calibre1">through various means the use of force by others.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">That is a point that is apparently too basic to appear in textbooks, or to</p>
<p class="calibre1">form a part of the civic discussion that presumably determines the course of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics.  But  it  is  also  too  basic  to  ignore  if  you  wish  to  understand  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolding Information Revolution. Protection of life and property is indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a crucial need that has bedeviled every society that ever existed. How to fend</p>
<p class="calibre1">o  violent aggression is history’s central dilemma. It cannot easily be solved, </p>
<p class="calibre1">notwithstanding the fact that protection can be provided in more than one</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Close of an Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">179</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-139"></a>As we write, the megapolitical consequences of the Information Age are only</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning to be felt. The economic change of recent decades has been from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the primacy of manufactures to that of information and computation, from</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine power to microprocessing, from factory to workstation, from mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">production to smal  teams, or even to persons working alone. As the scale of</p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise  fal s,  so  does  the  potential  for  sabotage  and  blackmail  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">workplace.  Smal er-scale  operations  are  much  more  di cult  to  organize  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">unions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microtechnology al ows  rms to be smal er, more footloose targets. Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal  in  services  or  products  with  negligible  natural-resource  content.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">principle,  these  businesses  could  be  conducted  almost  anywhere  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet.  They  are  not  trapped  at  a  speci c  location,  like  a  mine  or  a  port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  in  the  ful ness  of  time,  they  wil   be  far  less  susceptible  to  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxed, either by unions or by politicians. An old Chinese folk wisdom holds, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of al  the thirty-six ways to get out of trouble, the best way is&mdash;leave. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  that  Oriental  wisdom  wil   be  easily  applied.  If</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations become uncomfortable due to excessive demands in one location, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it wil  be far easier to move. Indeed, as we explore below, it wil  be possible in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Information  Age  to  create  virtual  corporations  whose  domicile  in  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction  wil   be  entirely  contingent  on  the  spot  market.  An  overnight</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  in  the  degree  of  attempted  extortion,  either  by  governments  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">others, could lead to the activities and assets of the virtual corporation  eeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the jurisdiction at the speed of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  growing  integration  of  microtechnology  into  industrial  processes</p>
<p class="calibre1">means  that  even  those  rms  that  stil   deal  in  manufactured  products  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">great economies of scale are no longer as vulnerable to the leverage of violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  they  once  were.  An  example  il ustrating  this  point  is  the  col apse  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United Auto Workers union’s lengthy strike against Caterpil ar, which was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cal ed  o   in  the  waning  days  of  1995  after  almost  two  years.  Unlike  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembly lines of the 1930s, today’s Caterpil ar plant employs far more skil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers. Pressed by foreign competition, Caterpil ar farmed out much of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">low-skil   work,  closed  ine cient  plants,  and  spent  almost  $2  bil ion</p>
<p class="calibre1">computerizing machine tools and instal ing assembly robots. Even the strike</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself helped spur labor-saving e ciencies. The company now claims to need</p>
<p class="calibre1">two thousand fewer employees than when the walkout began<a href="#calibre_link-10">.11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">180</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-140"></a>The  megapolitics  of  the  production  process  has  altered  more  drastical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">than most people realize. This change is not yet clearly visible, partly because</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is always a lag between a revolution in megapolitical conditions and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutional changes it inevitably precipitates. Further, the rapid evolution of</p>
<p class="calibre1">microprocessing  technology  means  that  products  are  now  on  the  horizon</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose megapolitical consequences can be anticipated even before they exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They wil  make for a far di erent world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">EXPLOITATION OF THE CAPITALISTS BY THE WORKERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The character of technology through most of the twentieth century made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forcible seizure of a factory, or a sit-down, strike, a hard tactic for owners or</p>
<p class="calibre1">managers  to  counter.  As  historian  Robert  S.  McElvaine  put  it,  a  sit-down</p>
<p class="calibre1">strike “made it di cult for employers to break the strike without doing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same to their own equipment. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”12  </a>In  e ect,  the  workers  physical y  held  the owners’  capital  to  ransom.  For  reasons  we  explore  below,  larger  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">companies proved easier targets for unions to exploit than smal er  rms. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">1937, General Motors was perhaps the leading industrial corporation in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. Its factories were among the largest and most costly aggregations of</p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery  ever  assembled,  employing  many  thousands  of  workers.  Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour, every day that the GM plants were forced to sit idle cost the company a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal   fortune.  A  strike  that  remained  unsettled  for  weeks,  like  that  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">winter of 1936-37, meant rapidly bal ooning losses. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Defying Supply and Demand</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to produce automobiles after the seizure of its third plant, GM soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitulated to the union. This was hardly an economic decision based upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the supply and demand for labor. Far from it. When General Motors acceded</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  union  demands  there  were  nine  mil ion  persons  unemployed  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States,  14  percent  of  the  workforce.  Most  of  those  without  work</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  gladly  have  taken  jobs  at  GM.  They  certainly  had  the  skil s  to  l</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembly-line  jobs,  although  you  might  not  know  this  from  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemporary  accounts.  A  delicate  etiquette  shrouded  straightforward</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysis of labor relations during the industrial period. One of its pretenses</p>
<p class="calibre1">181</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-141"></a>was  the  idea  that  factory  jobs,  particularly  in  the  middle  of  the  twentieth century,  were  skil ed  work.  This  was  untrue.  Most  factory  jobs  could  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  performed  by  almost  anyone  capable  of  showing  up  on  time.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">required little or no training, not even the ability to read or write. As recently</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  1980s,  large  fractions  of  the  General  Motors  workforce  were  either</p>
<p class="calibre1">il iterate,  innumerate,  or  both.  Until  the  1990s,  the  typical  assembly-line</p>
<p class="calibre1">worker at GM received only one day of orientation before taking his place on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the assembly line. A job you can learn in a single day is not skil ed work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet in 1937, with unskil ed and skil ed workers alike lined up begging for</p>
<p class="calibre1">jobs, GM factory workers were able to coerce their employers into a pay hike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their success had much more to do with the dynamics of violence than with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the supply and demand for labor. In March 1937, the month fol owing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">settlement of the GM confrontation, there were 170 more sit-down strikes in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the United States. Most were successful. Similar episodes occurred in every</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialized country. The workers simply seized the factories and ransomed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them back to the owners. It was a tactic of great simplicity, and one that in</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  cases  was  pro table  and  fun  for  those  participating.  One  sit-down</p>
<p class="calibre1">striker wrote, “I am having a great time, something new, something di erent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lots of grub and music.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">13</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The GM sit-down strike of 1936-37 and the other forcible plant seizures</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  time  were  examples  of  a  phenomenon  we  described  in   <i class="calibre4">Blood  in  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Streets</i> as “the exploitation of the capitalists by the workers.” This was not the</p>
<p class="calibre1">view  that  Pete  Seeger  set  to  music  in  his  sad  songs.  But  unless  you  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">planning a career as a folk singer in a blue-col ar neighborhood the important</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing to focus on is not the popular interpretation but the underlying reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever you look in history there is general y a layer of rationalization and</p>
<p class="calibre1">make-believe  that  disguises  the  true  megapolitical  foundations  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">systematic  extortion.  If  you  take  the  rationalizations  at  face  value,  you  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlikely to grasp what is real y going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DECIPHERING THE LOGIC OF EXTORTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To  recognize  the  megapolitical  implications  of  the  current  shift  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age, you have to strip away the cant and focus on the real logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  violence  in  society.  This  is  like  stripping  away  the  layers  of  an  overripe</p>
<p class="calibre1">182</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-484"></a>onion. It may bring tears to your eyes, but don’t look away. We  rst examine</p>
<p class="calibre1">the logic of extortion in the workplace, then extend the analysis to broader</p>
<p class="calibre1">issues  involving  the  creation  and  protection  of  assets,  and  the  nature  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern  government.  To  a  greater  degree  than  most  people  imagine,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperity of government, like that of unions, was directly correlated to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leverage  available  for  extortion.  That  leverage  was  much  lower  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth century than in the twentieth. In the next mil ennium, it wil  fal</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost to the vanishing point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  whole  logic  of  government  and  the  character  of  power  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformed by microprocessing. This may seem exaggerated when you  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">think  about  it.  But  look  closely.  The  prosperity  of  governments  has  gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand in hand with the prosperity of labor unions in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  this  century,  most  governments  commandeered  far  fewer  resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  the  militant  welfare  states  to  which  we  have  become  accustomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Likewise, unions were smal  or insigni cant factors in economic life prior to</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  century.  The  ability  of  workers  to  coerce  their  employers  into  paying</p>
<p class="calibre1">above-market wages depended upon the same megapolitical conditions that</p>
<p class="calibre1">al owed governments to extract 40 percent or more of the economy's output</p>
<p class="calibre1">in taxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Workplace Extortion Before the Twentieth Century</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The rise and fal  of union extortion of the capitalists can be readily explained</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  changing  megapolitics  of  the  production  process.  In  1776,  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam Smith published  <i class="calibre4">The Wealth of Nations, </i>  conditions  for  extortion  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the workplace were su ciently unfavorable that “combinations” by workmen</p>
<p class="calibre1">“to raise the price of their labour” were seldom tenable. Most manufacturing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rms  were  tiny  and  family-run.  Larger-scale  industrial  activities  were  just</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning to emerge. This did not rule out opportunities for violence, but it</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave  them  little  leverage.  Indeed,  during  Smith’s  time  and  wel   into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth century, unions were general y considered il egal combinations in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Great Britain, the United States, and other common-law countries. Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith described attempted strikes in these terms: “Their usual pretences are</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes  the  high  price  of  provisions;  sometimes  the  great  pro t  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">their master make by their work.…[T]hey have always recourse to the loudest</p>
<p class="calibre1">183</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-142"></a>clamour,  and  sometimes  to  the  most  shocking  violence  and  outrage.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  the  workmen  “very  seldom  derive  any  advantage  of  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumultuous  combinations,”  except  “the  punishment  or  ruin  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ringleaders.” <a href="#calibre_link-10">15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Scale  economies  in  industry  and  rm  size  grew  during  the  nineteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century. Yet most individuals continued to work for themselves as farmers or</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  proprietors, and union organizing e orts, like those described by Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith,  continued  to  “general y  end  in  nothing. <a href="#calibre_link-10">”16  </a>The  legal  and  political standing  of  unions  changed  only  as  the  scale  of  enterprise  rose.  The  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">unions  that  succeeded  in  organizing  were  craft  unions  of  highly  skil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers, who normal y organized without extensive violence. They tended to</p>
<p class="calibre1">settle for wage increases that matched the marginal costs of replacing them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unions for unskil ed workers were another story. They tended to exploit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shift  to  rms  of  larger  scale  by  singling  out  for  organizing  e orts  precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  industries  that  were  especial y  vulnerable  to  coercion,  either  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they operated at a larger scale or the character of the operations exposed their</p>
<p class="calibre1">owners to physical sabotage. This pattern was borne out from Newcastle to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Argentina. <a href="#calibre_link-10">17</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">An early example of violent labor movements in the United States was an</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack  on  the  Chesapeake  and  Ohio  Canal  in  1834.  Unlike  most  early-</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth-century  businesses,  the  C&amp;O  Canal  was  not  a  contained  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily protected operation. As original y planned, it was to have stretched 342</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles, with a 3,000-foot rise from the lower Potomac to the upper Ohio. <a href="#calibre_link-12">18</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Digging  such  a  ditch  was  a  big  job  that  never  quite  got  completed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, a large number of workers were employed trying to do it, some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  whom  were  not  long  in  recognizing  that  the  canal  could  be  easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">incapacitated. Indeed, without regular maintenance, it could be sabotaged by</p>
<p class="calibre1">muskrats burrowing under the towpath. In operation, the canal’s locks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">channels could be ruined simply by careless use,  oods from heavy rains, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">battering by untowed boats. It was a simple matter for strikers to blockade the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waterway  with  sunken  boats  or  other  debris.  In  early  1834,  rioting  among</p>
<p class="calibre1">rival gangs of Irish workers on the C&amp;O led to an attempt to make good this</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential and seize the canal. The e ort failed, however, leaving  ve persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead, after President Andrew Jackson sent federal troops from Ft. McHenry</p>
<p class="calibre1">to disperse the workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">184</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-143"></a>Mines and railroads also o ered early targets of choice for union activism</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  America.  Like  the  C&amp;O  Canal,  they,  too,  were  highly  vulnerable  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotage. Mines, for example, could be  ooded, or blockaded at the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply kil ing the mules that towed the ore cars out of underground mines</p>
<p class="calibre1">created a di cult and unpleasant situation for the owners. Likewise, railroad</p>
<p class="calibre1">trackbeds  stretched  over  many  miles,  and  could  be  guarded  only  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">di culty. It was relatively easy for union thugs to attack mines and railroads</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  do  substantial  economic  damage.  Such  attacks  became  commonplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">during  attempts  to  organize  e ective  unions.  These  e orts  were  general y</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  intense  during  periods  when  real  wages  were  rising  due  to  de ation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  owners  attempted  to  adjust  nominal  wages,  this  often  triggered</p>
<p class="calibre1">protests  leading  to  violence.  Such  incidents  were  widespread  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">depression that fol owed the Panic of 1873. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  December  1874,  open  warfare  erupted  in  the  anthracite  coal elds  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">eastern Pennsylvania. The unions organized a violent strike force in the guise</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a secret society named the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Also known as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the “Mol y Maguires,” after an Irish revolutionary, this group was known for</p>
<p class="calibre1">“terrorizing the coal  elds and preventing those miners who wished to work</p>
<p class="calibre1">from doing so. Sabotage and destruction of property, outright murder and</p>
<p class="calibre1">assassination, were al  charged against its members. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”19</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There was also recurring violence among railroad employees. For example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there were serious outbreaks in July 1877 aimed at destroying the property of</p>
<p class="calibre1">both  the  Pennsylvania  and  Baltimore  &amp;  Ohio  railroads.  Workers  took  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">switches, tore up tracks, sealed o  caryards, disabled locomotives, sabotaged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then  looted  trains,  and  worse.  In  Pittsburgh,  roundhouses  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pennsylvania  Railroad  were  set  ablaze  with  hundreds  of  people  inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dozens were kil ed, two thousand railcars were burned and looted and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine  shop  was  destroyed,  along  with  a  grain  elevator  and  125</p>
<p class="calibre1">locomotives. Federal troops intervened to restore order<a href="#calibre_link-12">.20</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Although these early strikes were interpreted sympathetical y by socialist</p>
<p class="calibre1">and union activists, they inspired little public support. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherent  vulnerability  of  industries  such  as  mines  and  railroads,  overal</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  conditions  were  not  yet  favorable  to  the  exploitation  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalists by the workers. The scale of enterprise was too smal  to facilitate</p>
<p class="calibre1">systematic extortion. While there were vulnerable industries, they employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">185</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-144"></a>too smal  a fraction of the population to al ow the bene ts of the coercion</p>
<p class="calibre1">against  employers  to  be  broadly  shared.  Without  such  support,  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsustainable  because  owners  could  depend  upon  the  government  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection.  While  unions  sometimes  attempted  through  intimidation  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent  local  o cials  from  enforcing  injunctions,  these  e orts,  too,  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">seldom  successful.  Even  the  most  violent  strikes  were  usual y  suppressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">within days or weeks by military means. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Blackmail Made Easy</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a lesson to be learned for the Information Age in the fact that union</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts to achieve wages above market-clearing levels were seldom successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  rm size was smal . Not even those lines of business that were clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerable  to  sabotage,  such  as  canals,  railways,  streetcars,  and  mines,  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily  brought  under  control.  This  is  not  because  the  unions  shrank  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">using violence. To the contrary. Violence was lavishly employed, sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">against  high-pro le  individuals.  For  example,  in  a  case  celebrated  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">American labor movement as a case of “miners’ vengeance,” Governor Frank</p>
<p class="calibre1">Steunenberg of Idaho, who had opposed an attempt by miners to blockade</p>
<p class="calibre1">properties at Coeur d’Alene, was assassinated by a bomb tossed by a contract</p>
<p class="calibre1">kil er  hired  by  the  union. <a href="#calibre_link-12">21</a>  But  even  murder  and  threats  of  murder  were usual y  insu cient  to  obtain  union  recognition  prior  to  the  emergence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">large-scale factories and mass-production enterprises in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To understand why the circumstances of unions underwent such a change</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the twentieth century, you must look at the characteristics of production</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology. Something de nitely changed with the rapid rise of blue-col ar</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  employment  in  the  early  decades  of  the  twentieth  century.  This</p>
<p class="calibre1">change made businesses at the forefront of the economy especial y vulnerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  extortion.  In  fact,  the  physical  characteristics  of  industrial  technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  invited  workers  to  employ  coercion  to  shake  down  the  capitalists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.  <i class="calibre4">There  was  a  high  natural-resource  content  in  most  industrial  products. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This tended to anchor production to a limited number of locations, almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  way  that  mines  must  be  located  where  the  ore  bodies  are.  Factories</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed near transportation centers with convenient access to parts suppliers</p>
<p class="calibre1">186</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-329"></a>and raw materials had signi cant operating advantages. This made it easier</p>
<p class="calibre1">for coercive organizations, like governments and unions, to extract some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those advantages for themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  <i class="calibre4">Rising economies of scale led to very large enterprises. </i> Early-nineteenth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century factories had been relatively smal . But as scale economies increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  the  assembly  line  during  the  twentieth  century,  the  size  and  cost  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities at the forefront of the production process rose rapidly. This made</p>
<p class="calibre1">them easier targets in several ways. For example, signi cant scale economies</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend to go hand in hand with long product cycles. Long product cycles make</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  more  stable  markets.  This,  in  turn,  invites  predatory  targeting  of  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it implies that there are longer-term bene ts to capture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  <i class="calibre4">The number of competitors in leading industries fell sharply. </i> It was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncommon  during  the  industrial  period  to  nd  only  a  handful  of  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">competing for bil ion-dol ar markets. This contributed to making these  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">targets  for  union  extortion.  It  is  far  simpler  to  attack  ve  rms  than  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand.  The  very  concentration  of  industry  was  itself  a  factor  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitated  extortion.  This  advantage  was  self-reinforcing  because  the  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">coerced into paying monopoly wages were unlikely to face sti  competition</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  others  who  were  not  also  burdened  by  above-market  labor  costs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unions  could  therefore  drain  a  considerable  portion  of  the  pro ts  of  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">rms  without  exposing  them  to  immediate  bankruptcy.  Obviously,  if</p>
<p class="calibre1">employers had routinely gone broke whenever they were forced to pay above-</p>
<p class="calibre1">market wages, workers would have gained little by coercing them to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  <i class="calibre4">The capital requirements for fixed investment rose to match the scale of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">enterprise. </i> This not only increased the vulnerability of capital and magni ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the costs of plant closures; it also made it increasingly unlikely that a modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  could  be  owned  by  a  single  individual  or  family,  except  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">inheritance from someone who had launched the business at a smal er scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to fund the massive costs of tooling and operating a large factory, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth  of  hundreds  or  thousands  of  people  had  to  be  pooled  together  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital markets. This tended to make it more di cult for the splintered and</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost anonymous owners to defend their property. They had little choice</p>
<p class="calibre1">but to rely upon professional managers who seldom held more than a bare</p>
<p class="calibre1">chemical  trace  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  the  company.  Reliance  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">subordinate  managers  weakened  the  resistance  of  rms  to  extortion.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">187</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-145"></a>managers  lacked  strong  incentives  to  risk  life  and  limb  protecting  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">property  of  the  rm.  Their  e orts  seldom  matched  the  kind  of  militancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly  seen  among  owners  of  liquor  stores  and  other  smal   businesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">when their property comes under threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.  <i class="calibre4">Greater  firm  size  also  meant  that  more  of  the  total  workforce  was</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">employed in fewer firms than at any time in the past. </i> In some cases, tens of</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands  of  workers  found  employment  in  a  single  company.  In  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms,  the  owners  and  managers  were  starkly  outnumbered  by  persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  in  subordinate  positions.  Ratios  of  thirty  to  one  or  worse  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">common. This disadvantage rose with  rm size because massive numbers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers  assembled  together  could  more  easily  employ  violence  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymous way. Under such conditions, the workers were unlikely to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">had any meaningful contact or relationships with the owners of the factory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anonymous character of these relationships no doubt made it easier for</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers to dismiss the importance of the owners’ property rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6.  <i class="calibre4">Massed  employment  in  a  small  number  of  firms  was  a  broad  social</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">phenomenon. </i> This further enhanced the megapolitical advantages enjoyed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">unions as compared to the nineteenth century in America, when most people</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  self-employed  or  working  in  smal   rms.  In  1940,  60  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">American  workforce  had  blue-col ar  jobs. <a href="#calibre_link-12">22</a>  As  a  consequence,  support  for the  use  of  extortion  to  raise  wages  spread  among  a  large  number  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined they might bene t by it. This was il ustrated by a 1938-39 study of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the views of 1,700 people in Akron, Ohio, toward corporate property. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">survey found that 68 percent of the CIO Rubber Workers had very little or</p>
<p class="calibre1">no sympathy with the concept of corporate property, “while only one percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  found  in  the  classi cation  of  strong  support  of  corporate  property</p>
<p class="calibre1">rights.” <a href="#calibre_link-12">23</a>  On  the  other  hand,  not  a  single  businessman,  even  a  smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprietor,  fel   into  the  same  category  of  “strong  opposition  to  corporate</p>
<p class="calibre1">property; 94 percent received ratings in the range of extremely high support</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the rights of property. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”24</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">7.  <i class="calibre4">Assembly-line  technology  was  inherently  sequential. </i>  The  fact  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  production  process  depended  upon  the  movement  and  assembly  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">parts in a  xed sequence created additional vulnerabilities to disruption. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ect, the assembly line was like a railroad within factory wal s. If the track</p>
<p class="calibre1">188</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-146"></a>could  be  blocked,  or  the  availability  of  a  single  part  could  be  cut  o ,  the whole production process was brought to a halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8.  <i class="calibre4">Assembly-line technology standardized work. </i> This reduced the variability</p>
<p class="calibre1">of output for persons of di erent skil s working with the same tools. In fact, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crucial objective of factory design was to create a system in which a genius</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a moron on successive shifts of the assembly line would produce the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">product.  What  might  be  cal ed  “stupid”  machines  were  designed  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable of only one kind of output. This made it unnecessary for even the</p>
<p class="calibre1">buyer  of  a  Cadil ac  to  inquire  about  the  identity  of  the  line  workers  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">produced his vehicle. Al  the products were meant to be alike, whatever the</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erences  in  skil s  and  intel igence  between  the  workers  who  produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that unskil ed workers on the assembly line could produce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same product as more able individuals contributed to the egalitarian agenda</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  making  it  appear  that  everyone’s  economic  contributions  were  equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entrepreneurial skil s and mental e ort seemed less important. The magic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern production appeared to lie in the machines themselves. If they could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not actual y have been designed by everyone, they nevertheless appeared to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">intel ectual y accessible to almost everyone. This gave more plausibility to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ction  that  unskil ed  labor  was  being  “exploited”  by  factory  owners  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be cut out of the equation with no loss to anyone but themselves. “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned we can take the plant,” as one GM striker put it. “We already knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">how  to  run  them.  If  General  Motors  isn’t  careful  wel   put  two  and  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">together. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”25</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">These  characteristics  of  industrial  technology  led  uniformly  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation of labor unions to exploit the vulnerability to shakedowns, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger  governments  that  fattened  on  the  high  taxes  that  could  be  imposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  large-scale  industrial  facilities.  This  did  not  happen  once  or  twice,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened everywhere large-scale industry took root. Time after time, unions</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged  to  employ  violence  to  achieve  wages  considerably  above  market</p>
<p class="calibre1">levels.  They  were  able  to  do  this  because  industrial  factories  tended  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">expensive, conspicuous, immobile, and costly. They could scarcely be hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They could not be moved. Every moment they were out of service meant that</p>
<p class="calibre1">their staggering costs were not being amortized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">189</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-147"></a>Al  this made them sitting ducks for coercive shakedowns, a fact that is far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more obvious in the history of labor unions than the prevailing ideology of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twentieth century would have you believe. The noted economist Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simons framed the issue in 1944:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Labor  organization  without  large  powers  of  coercion  and  intimidation  is  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreal abstraction. Unions now have such powers; they always have had and</p>
<p class="calibre1">always wil  have, so long as they persist in the present form. Where the power is</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  or insecurely possessed, it must be exercised overtly and extensively; large</p>
<p class="calibre1">and unchal enged, it becomes like the power of government, con dently held, </p>
<p class="calibre1">respectful y regarded, and rarely displayed conspicuously.” <a href="#calibre_link-12">26</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As precise as Simons’s analysis is, however, he was wrong about a crucial</p>
<p class="calibre1">point.  He  presumed  that  unions  “always  wil   have”  what  he  described  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“large powers of coercion and intimidation.” In fact, unions are fading away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  merely  in  the  United  States  and  Great  Britain,  but  in  other  mature</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial societies. The reason they are fading, what Simons missed and what</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  many  union  organizers  fail  to  understand,  is  that  the  shift  to  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Society has altered megapolitical conditions in crucial ways that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharply increase the security of property. Microtechnology has already begun</p>
<p class="calibre1">to prove subversive of the extortion that supports the welfare state because</p>
<p class="calibre1">even in the commercial realm it creates very di erent incentives from those of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.  <i class="calibre4">Information technology has negligible natural-resource content. </i> It confers</p>
<p class="calibre1">few if any inherent advantages of location. Most information technology is</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly portable. Because it can function independent of place, information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  increases  the  mobility  of  ideas,  persons,  and  capital.  General</p>
<p class="calibre1">Motors could not pack up its three assembly lines in Flint, Michigan, and  y</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. A software company can. The owners can download their algorithms</p>
<p class="calibre1">into portable computers and take the next plane out. Such  rms also have an</p>
<p class="calibre1">added  inducement  to  escape  high  taxes  or  union  demands  for  monopoly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wages. Smal er  rms tend to have more competitors. If you have dozens or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even hundreds of competitors tempting your customers, you cannot a ord to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay politicians or your employees much more than they are actual y worth. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you alone tried to do so, your costs would be higher than your competitors</p>
<p class="calibre1">and you would go broke. The absence of signi cant operating advantages in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">190</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-328"></a>given locale means that coercive organizations, like governments and unions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  inevitably have less leverage to exploit in trying to extract some of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages for themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  <i class="calibre4">Information  technology  lowers  the  scale  of  enterprise. </i>  This  makes  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal er  rm  size,  which  implies  a  larger  number  of  competitors.  Increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  reduces  the  potential  for  extortion  by  raising  the  number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">targets that must be physical y control ed in order to raise wages or tax rates</p>
<p class="calibre1">above competitive levels. The sharp fal  in the average size of  rms facilitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  information  technology  has  already  reduced  the  number  of  persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed in subordinate positions. In the United States, for example, widely</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported estimates suggest that as many as 30 mil ion persons worked alone in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their own  rms in 1996. Obviously, these 30 mil ion are unlikely to go on</p>
<p class="calibre1">strike against themselves. It is only slightly less plausible that the additional</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ions who work in smal   rms with a handful of employees would attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">to coerce their employers into paying above-market wages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Information Age, workers who wish to raise their wages through</p>
<p class="calibre1">extortion  wil   lack  the  military  advantage  of  overwhelming  numbers  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">made them more formidable within the factory. The fewer persons employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  any  rm,  the  fewer  the  opportunities  for  anonymous  violence.  For  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason alone, ten thousand workers divided among  ve hundred  rms would</p>
<p class="calibre1">pose a lesser threat to the property of those  rms than ten thousand workers</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a single  rm, even if the ratio of workers to owners/managers were exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  <i class="calibre4">Falling scale in enterprise also implies that efforts to secure above-market</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">wages  are  less  likely  to  command  broad  social  support,  as  they  did  in  the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">industrial period. </i> Unions seeking to shake down employers are much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely  to  nd  themselves  in  the  situation  of  the  canal  workers,  railroad</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees,  and  miners  of  the  nineteenth  century.  Even  where  a  few  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">with large-scale economies remain as holdovers from the Industrial Age, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  do so in a context of widely dispersed employment in smal   rms. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">preponderance of smal   rms and smal holders suggests greater social support</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  property  rights  even  if  the  desire  to  redistribute  income  remains</p>
<p class="calibre1">unaltered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  <i class="calibre4">Information technology lowers capital costs, </i> which also tends to increase</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  by  facilitating  entrepreneurship  and  al owing  more  people  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">191</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-392"></a>work independently. Lower capital requirements not only reduce barriers to</p>
<p class="calibre1">entry; they also reduce “barriers to exit.” In other words, they imply that  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">are likely to have fewer assets relative to income, and therefore less ability to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustain  losses.  Not  only  wil   they  tend  to  have  less  recourse  to  banks  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">borrowing;  rms in the Information Age are also likely to have fewer physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">assets to capture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.  <i class="calibre4">Information technology shortens the product cycle. </i> This makes for more</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapid product obsolescence. This, too, tends to make any gains that might be</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieved by extorting above-market wages short-lived. In highly competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets, wages that are too high may lead directly to a rapid loss of jobs and</p>
<p class="calibre1">even bankruptcy for the  rm. Grasping for temporarily higher wages at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">expense of placing your job in jeopardy is like burning your furniture to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">the house a few degrees warmer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6.  <i class="calibre4">Information technology</i>’  <i class="calibre4">is not sequential but simultaneous and dispersed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike the assembly line, information technology can accommodate multiple</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes  at  the  same  time.  It  disperses  activities  on  networks,  al owing  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">redundancy and substitution between workstations that could number in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands  or  even  the  mil ions  and  be  anywhere  on  earth.  In  increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers  of  activities,  it  is  possible  for  people  to  cooperate  without  ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming into physical contact with one another. As virtual reality and video</p>
<p class="calibre1">conferencing become more advanced, the trend toward dispersal of functions</p>
<p class="calibre1">and telecommuting wil  accelerate. This is the Information Age equivalent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“putting out,” which broke the power of the medieval guilds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that fewer and fewer people wil  be working together in smoky</p>
<p class="calibre1">factories not only takes away an important advantage that workers formerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed in engineering shakedowns of capitalists; it also makes it increasingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">di cult even to distinguish from racketeering the type of extortion that has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been acceptable in the workplace. Heretofore, only persons who have worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">together  and  been  employed-by  a  rm  in  a  common  setting  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted  to  use  violence  in  the  attempt  to  raise  their  incomes.  But  if  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“workplace” does not exist as a central location, and most of the functions are</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispersed  to  subcontractors  and  telecommuters,  there  is  very  little  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguish from a shakedown racket their e orts to extort money from their</p>
<p class="calibre1">clients or “employers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">192</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-382"></a>For example, is a telecommuter who demands extra cash under threat of</p>
<p class="calibre1">infecting  the  company’s  computers  with  a  virus  a  worker  on  strike?  Or  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internet racketeer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether he is one or the other wil  prove to be a distinction without a</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erence. The reaction of the targeted  rms is likely to be much the same in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any  event.  Technical  solutions  to  information  sabotage,  like  improved</p>
<p class="calibre1">encryption and network security, that would answer the danger of an outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">hacker should also render moot the capacity of the disgruntled employee or</p>
<p class="calibre1">subcontractor  to  impose  damage  on  parties  with  whom  he  regularly  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sporadical y deals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it might be suggested that the worker or telecommuter could</p>
<p class="calibre1">always report to the o ce and carry on a more traditional strike there. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">even this may not be as simple as it would seem in the Information Age. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity  of  information  technology  to  transcend  locality  and  disperse</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic functions means that for the  rst time employees and employers</p>
<p class="calibre1">need not even reside in the same jurisdictions. Here, we are not talking about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the di erence between being in the boroughs of Mayfair and Peckham, but of</p>
<p class="calibre1">employers in Bermuda and telecommuters in New Delhi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  if  the  Indians  became  infatuated  by  accounts  of  the  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">GM strikes of 1936-37 and determined to journey to Bermuda to picket, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">might  nd  no  physical  o ce  at  al   when  they  arrived.  Chiat/Day,  a  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertising company, has already set about dismantling its headquarters. Its</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees, or subcontractors, stay in touch through cal -forwarding and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internet. When it becomes necessary to assemble talent teams to coordinate</p>
<p class="calibre1">work on account projects, they rent hotel meeting rooms. When the project is</p>
<p class="calibre1">over they check out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  microprocessing  helps  to  liberate  and  disperse  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">production  process  from  the  xed  sequence  of  the  assembly  line  greatly</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduces the leverage formerly enjoyed by coercive institutions like unions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments. If the assembly line were like a railroad within factory wal s that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  easily  be  captured  by  a  sit-down  strike,  cyberspace  is  an  unbounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">realm without physical existence. It cannot be occupied by force or held to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ransom.  The  position  of  employees  wishing  to  use  violence  as  leverage  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">extract higher incomes wil  be far weaker in the Information Age than it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the sit-down strikers at General Motors in 1936-37. </p>
<p class="calibre1">193</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-485"></a>7.  <i class="calibre4">Microprocessing individualizes work. </i> Industrial technology standardized work.  Anyone  using  the  same  tools  would  produce  the  same  output. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microtechnology  has  started  replacing  “stupid”  machines  with  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">intel igent  technology  capable  of  highly  variable  output.  The  increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">variability  of  output  for  persons  using  the  same  tools  has  profound</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications,  many  of  which  we  explore  in  coming  chapters.  Among  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  important  is  the  fact  that  where  output  varies,  incomes  vary  as  wel . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the value in  elds where skil  varies wil  tend to be created by a smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  persons.  This  is  a  common  characteristic  of  the  most  highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive markets. It is quite evident, for example, in sports. Many mil ions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of young people worldwide play various versions of footbal . But 99 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  money  that  is  spent  to  watch  footbal   games  is  paid  to  see  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">performances of a tiny fraction of the total number of players. Likewise, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  is  ful   of  aspiring  actors  and  actresses.  Yet  only  a  relatively  smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">number  become  stars.  Equal y,  tens  of  thousands  of  books  are  published</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual y. But most of the royalty money is paid to a smal  number of best-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sel ing authors who can real y entertain their readers. Unhappily, we are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  vast  variability  of  output  among  persons  employing  the  same</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment  poses  yet  another  obstacle  to  extortion.  It  creates  a  major</p>
<p class="calibre1">bargaining problem about how to share the payo . Where a relatively smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">proportion of those participating in a given activity create most of the value, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it  is  al   but  mathematical y  impossible  for  them  to  be  left  better  o   by  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">coerced  outcome  that  averages  incomes.  One  software  programmer  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">devise an algorithm for control ing a robot that proves to be worth mil ions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another,  working  with  identical  equipment,  may  write  a  program  worth</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing. The more productive programmer is no more likely to wish to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  income  tied  to  that  of  his  compatriot  than  Tom  Clancy  is  to  agree  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">average his book royalties with ours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the early stages of the Information Revolution have made it far more</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious than it was in 1975 that skil s and mental ability are crucial variables</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  economic  output.  This  has  already  vaporized  the  once-proud</p>
<p class="calibre1">rationalization for extortion of the capitalists by the workers that prevailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the industrial period. The fantasy that unskil ed labor actual y created</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  value  that  seemed  to  be  pocketed  in  a  disproportionate  share  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">194</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-148"></a>capitalists  and  entrepreneurs  is  already  an  anachronism.  It  is  not  even  a plausible  ction  in  the  case  of  information  technology.  When  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmer sits down to write code, there is too direct a line of attribution</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  his  skil   and  his  product  to  al ow  for  much  mistake  about  who  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible.  It  is  obvious  beyond  dispute  that  an  il iterate  or  semi-literate</p>
<p class="calibre1">could not program a computer. It is therefore equal y obvious that any value</p>
<p class="calibre1">in programs compiled by others could not have been stolen from him. This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">why cries of “exploitation” by workers are now heard mainly among janitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  is  making  it  plain  that  the  problem  faced  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons of low skil  is not that their productive capacities are being unfairly</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken advantage of, but rather the fear that they may lack the ability to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a real economic contribution. As Kevin Kel y suggests in  <i class="calibre4">Out of Control, </i> the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Upstart” car company of the Information Age may be the brainchild of “a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dozen people,” who wil  outsource most of their parts, and stil  produce cars</p>
<p class="calibre1">more careful y customized and tailored to their buyer’s wishes than anything</p>

<p class="calibre1">The biggest changes in life occur to variables that no one watches. Or to put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it another way, we take for granted variables that have  uctuated very little for</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  or  even  hundreds  of  generations.  For  most  of  history,  if  not  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of human existence, the balance between protection and extortion has</p>
<p class="calibre1">uctuated within a narrow margin, with extortion always holding the upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.  Now  that  is  about  to  change.  Information  technology  is  laying  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">groundwork for a fundamental shift in the factors that determine the costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and rewards of resorting to violence. The fact that intel igent agents wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">available to investigate and perhaps retaliate in one fashion or another against</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who initiate violence is merely a hint of this new vista in protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty- ve  years  ago,  the  fol owing  statement  would  have  been  no  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the ranting of a crank: “If you kil  me, I wil  sweep the money out of</p>

<p class="calibre1">mil ennium, it may not be. Whether it would prove to be a practical threat</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be determined by factors of time and place. Yet even if the would-be</p>
<p class="calibre1">miscreant’s accounts proved to be impermeable, there would surely be other</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">New Alternatives in Protection</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is only one of many ways to enhance protection that are being opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the technology of the Information Age, most of which tend to undermine</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  near-monopoly  on  protection  and  extortion  that  has  been  enjoyed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments in the past two centuries. Even without the new technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">razzle-dazzle,  there  have  always  been  alternatives  for  protection,  not  al   of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which have tended to be monopolized by government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A person who feels threatened may simply run away. When the world was</p>
<p class="calibre1">young and horizons were open, the option to  ee was commonly employed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When people worry about losses due to theft or vandalism, they may elect to</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase  insurance  policies  to  indemnify  such  risks.  Curses  and  spel s, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although weak forms of protection, have also saved lives and warded o  acts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of theft. They sometimes work in societies where predators are superstitious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valuables  may  also  be  protected  by  being  hidden.  This  is  sometimes  an</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-323"></a>e ective method when it can be employed. Assets can be buried. Secured with</p>

<p class="calibre1">monitoring  devices.  But  hiding  person  and  property  have  not  always  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">practical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  al   the  variety  of  means  of  protection  that  have  been  employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">historical y,  one  method  has  dominated  al   others&mdash;the  capacity  to  trump</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  with  violence,  to  cal   on  greater  force  to  overwhelm  anyone  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would assault you or steal your property. The question is where you can turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">for such a service, and how you can motivate anyone to risk life and limb to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help you battle thugs who might initiate force against you. Sometimes close</p>
<p class="calibre1">relatives have answered the cal . Sometimes tribal and clan-based groups have</p>
<p class="calibre1">served  as  an  uno cial  police,  responding  to  violence  against  any  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">members  with  blood  vendettas.  Sometimes  mercenaries  or  private  guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  employed  to  fend  o   attack,  but  not  always  as  useful y  as  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">might  wish.  The  new  intel igent  agents  of  the  Information  Age,  although</p>
<p class="calibre1">their activities wil  be largely con ned to cyberspace, add a new alternative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  loyalties,  unlike  those  of  the  mercenaries,  private  guards,  and  even</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  use  of  violence  to  protect  against  violence  is  fraught  with  paradoxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under conditions that have heretofore existed, any group or agency that you</p>
<p class="calibre1">could employ to successful y protect your life and wealth from attack would</p>
<p class="calibre1">also necessarily have had the capacity to take either. That is a drawback for</p>
<p class="calibre1">which there is no easy answer. Normal y, you could look to competition to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep  providers  of  an  economic  service  from  ignoring  the  wishes  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers.  But  where  violence  is  concerned,  direct  competition  often  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">perverse results. In the past, it has usual y led to increased violence. When two</p>
<p class="calibre1">would-be protective agencies send their forces to arrest one another, the result</p>
<p class="calibre1">is more akin to civil war than protection. When you are seeking protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">from violence you normal y do not wish to increase the output of violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">but  to  suppress  it.  And  to  suppress  it  on  terms  that  do  not  al ow  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">This is why anarchy, or “the war of al  against al ,” as Hobbes described it, has</p>
<p class="calibre1">seldom  been  a  satisfactory  state  of  a airs.  Local  competition  in  the  use  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">less of it. Occasional y, freethinking enthusiasts for the market have suggested</p>

<p class="calibre1">that free-market provision of police and justice services has not proven viable</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Government as a Seller of Protection</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As we have said at several points, government’s principal economic function</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the perspective of those who pay the taxes is to provide protection of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life  and  property.  Yet  the  government  often  operates  like  organized  crime, </p>
<p class="calibre1">extracting resources from people within its sphere of operations as tribute or</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunder. Government is not only a protection service; it is also a protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">racket.  While  government  provides  protection  against  violence  originating</p>
<p class="calibre1">with others, like the protection racket it also charges customers for protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">against  harm  that  it  would  otherwise  impose  itself.  The  rst  action  is  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic service. The second is a racket. In practice, the distinction between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  two  forms  of  “protection”  may  be  di cult  to  make.  Governments,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles Til y has pointed out, may perhaps be best understood as “our largest</p>
<p class="calibre1">examples of organized crime. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”32</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The activities of even the best government usual y involved some mixture</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the economic service of protection combined with extortion. Historical y, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both  pursuits  could  be  optimized  if  the  government  could  impose  a  near-</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly on coercion within the territories where it operates. In cases where</p>
<p class="calibre1">a single armed group could establish predominance in the use of violence, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality of the protection service it could provide was normal y far superior to</p>
<p class="calibre1">what could be had from one of several competing protection agencies thrown</p>
<p class="calibre1">into battle over the same territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">200</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-152"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">A Natural Monopoly on Land</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Achievement of a local monopoly of coercion not only al owed a government</p>
<p class="calibre1">to more e ectively protect its potential customers from violence initiated by</p>
<p class="calibre1">others; it also greatly reduced the government’s operating costs. As Lane put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,  “The  violence-using,  violence-control ing  industry  was  a  natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly, at least on land. Within territorial limits, the service it rendered</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  produced  much  more  cheaply  by  a  monopoly. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”33</a>  Thus  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“monopoly  of  the  use  of  force  within  a  contiguous  territory  enabled  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection-producing  enterprise  to  improve  its  product  and  reduce  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”34 </a>Such a governing organization could o er more protection with less</p>
<p class="calibre1">expense if it did not have to engage in incessant military actions to fend o</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  groups  seeking  to  extract  protection  payments  from  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  prospect  that  information  technology  wil   help  “relax”  the</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sovereignty: Territory and Political Economy in the Twenty-first Century, </i> by</p>
<p class="calibre1">David  J.  Elkins.  Elkins  echoes  our  thesis  that  monopoly  governments  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined  to  be  disintermediated  much  as  religious  monopolies  were  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">years  fol owing  1500.  He  writes:  “We  used  to  assume  that  religions  should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have their own territory or ‘turf.’ As nations replaced universal religions as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereign arbiters of life and death, the ‘compactness’ and ‘boundedness’ of</p>
<p class="calibre1">religion gave way to our now familiar intermingling of believers in the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">area.  Instead,  we  refuse  to  countenance  the  intermingling  of  nations,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">provinces for that matter, although I believe this assumption is in the process</p>
<p class="calibre1">of breaking down. <a href="#calibre_link-12">”35  </a>He  goes  on  to  argue,  in  keeping  with  our  view,  that territorial monopolies on sovereignty can be broken down without anarchy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as  evidenced  by  the  split  in  sovereignty  between  national  and  provincial</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  in  a  federal  system  like  Canada’s,  and  by  the  condominium</p>
<p class="calibre1">government involving joint French and British sovereignty that characterized</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  Paci c  Islands  for  much  of  this  century.  Thus,  while  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolies on sovereignty have rarely been unbundled by force, they can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbundled by agreement. According to Elkins, and we agree, “The territorial</p>

<p class="calibre1">202</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-154"></a>The simple fact is that the larger sense of patriotism&mdash;a love of nation, a sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  lial  duty  to  it&mdash;is  not  a  particularly  useful  predisposition  to  have  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer.…  Citizens  who  thrive  in  the  global  society  wil   identify  themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">global y. They wil  make political, social, and economic choices based not on</p>
<p class="calibre1">national identity, but on how those choices relate to themselves directly and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">people like them around the world.… Nations and corporations who thrive wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">organize themselves accordingly. They wil  maximize the freedom to know, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go,  to  do,  and  to  be.  Nations  and  corporations  that  don’t,  that  continue  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ght rear-guard actions based on nostalgia, wil  atrophy. <a href="#calibre_link-13">39</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The devaluation of physical borders implied by the tripling of bandwidth</p>
<p class="calibre1">each year and the geometric growth of the Internet and World Wide Web wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerate  the  process  of  disintermediating  governments.  Indeed,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuation of the annual tripling of bandwidth until the year 2012 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">imply  a  bil ionfold  growth  in  bandwidth  since  1993,  when  George  Gilder</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst  suggested  that  bandwidth  was  destined  to  compound  even  faster  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the capacity of microprocessors. If this comes to pass&mdash;as we believe it wil , to</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge  by  recent  breakthroughs  in  integrated  optics&mdash;the  abundance  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications capability that would be created would result in a fantastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  in  cybercommerce.  With  wave  division  multiplexing,  a  single  ber</p>
<p class="calibre1">strand, as thin as a human hair, has the capacity to carry one tril ion bits per</p>

<p class="calibre1">twenty- ve  times  more  bits  than  the  total  load  of  al   of  the  world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications  networks  combined.  The  capacity  for  expansion  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupefying. With this much communications capacity unleashed, vastly more</p>
<p class="calibre1">money wil  be spent on communication because it wil  be so cheap. And such</p>
<p class="calibre1">established  media  as  dedicated  telephony  and  television  wil   become</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronisms.  The  World  Wide  Web  wil   deliver  a  richer  mix  of  signals  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">every computer than consumers experience with network television today. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bandwidth revolution unfolds, it wil  draw people more and more into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  borderless  virtual  world  of  online  communities  and  cybercommerce,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">world with enough graphic density to become the “metaverse,” the kind of</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-324"></a>shrink,  giving  states  a  growing  incentive  to  franchise  and  fragment  their sovereignty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  nation-states  today  have  incentives  to  host  free  ports,  free-trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">zones, and zona francas, so they wil  have incentives to lease their sovereignty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already discussed the wel -advanced negotiations between the nine-</p>

<p class="calibre1">Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, more commonly known as the Knights</p>

<p class="calibre1">smal   enclaves  and  remote  areas  to  entirely  new  a nity  groups  and  virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">communities.  Indeed,  it  is  not  unlikely  that  commercial  entities,  such  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">security  rms and hotel chains, wil  bid for sovereignty over smal  patches of</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory.  Wackenhut,  Pinkerton,  and  Argenbright  may,  in  the  future,  o er</p>
<p class="calibre1">hybrid gated retirement communities and tax-free zones in attractive climates</p>
<p class="calibre1">around  the  world.  Religious  entities,  like  the  Knights  of  Malta,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">representing every conceivable denomination, wil  try in their own ways to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make heaven incarnate in certain out-of-the-way corners of the earth. Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy individuals and families wil  possess their own plots where they wil</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MONOPOLY AND PLUNDER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Note  that  the  incentives  to  share  or  lease  sovereignty  for  a  fee  are  quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent  from  those  that  have  historical y  faced  rulers  exposed  to  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition with their local monopoly of coercion. Leased sovereignty is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  destabilizing  than  hosting  a  free-trade  zone.  By  contrast,  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition for power, of the kind pursued by battling warlords and guerril a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bands,  directly  a ects  whether  the  would-be  government  has  stronger</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentives  to  protect  people  within  its  grasp  or  to  plunder  them.  Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">contending groups wrestle and maneuver in uneasy balance, the incentives to</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  predatory  violence  increase.  Plunder  becomes  more  attractive.  Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">power is less stable, and the local monopoly of coercion less secure, the time</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizons of those with the capacity to employ violence shrinks. The “king of</p>
<p class="calibre1">204</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-155"></a>the mountain” may stand on such a slippery slope that he could not expect to</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive long enough to realize a share of the substantial gains that ultimately</p>
<p class="calibre1">result  from  containing  violence.  When  that  is  the  case,  there  is  little  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent  those  who  command  what  passes  for  government  from  employing</p>
<p class="calibre1">their power to terrorize and pil age society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  logic  of  force,  therefore,  tel s  you  that  the  more  competing  armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups there are operating in any territory, the higher the likelihood that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   resort  to  predatory  violence.  Without  a  single  overwhelming  power  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppress freelance violence, it tends to proliferate, and many of the gains of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic and social cooperation go up in smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The damage that can occur when violence is given ful  reign in a condition</p>
<p class="calibre1">of anarchy is demonstrated by the fate of China under the warlords in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1920s.  It  is  a  story  we  recounted  in   <i class="calibre4">The  Great  Reckoning. </i>  The  competing</p>
<p class="calibre1">warlords  imposed  great  damage  in  areas  where  there  was  no  single, </p>

<p class="calibre1">similar point have been broadcast to the world in living color by CNN news</p>

<p class="calibre1">Somalia’s warlords, nicknamed the “technicals,” brought anarchy to that sad</p>
<p class="calibre1">country  before  the  United  States  led  a  massive  military  intervention  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">contain them. When the commanding might of U.S. forces was withdrawn, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  technicals  brought  out  their  weapons  again,  and  anarchy  resumed.  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">report in the  <i class="calibre4">Washington Post</i> observed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">[P]ickup  trucks  mounted  with  antiaircraft  guns  are  once  again  plowing  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;NORBERT ELIAS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE EVOLUTION OF PROTECTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane developed an argument that we have misappropriated for our purposes</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  imagining  how  the  Information  Age  may  unfold.  He  argued  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">history of Western economies since the Dark Ages can be interpreted in terms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of four stages of competition and monopoly in the organization of violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Lane is largely silent about the megapolitical factors that we identify as</p>
<p class="calibre1">in uencing  the  scale  at  which  governments  operate,  his  exploration  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economics of violence coincides closely with the argument we spel ed out in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Blood in the Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i> and elsewhere in this volume. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already analyzed some of the megapolitical factors that played a</p>
<p class="calibre1">role in the evolution of Western society fol owing the fal  of Rome. Lane also</p>
<p class="calibre1">examined  this  period,  focusing  on  the  economic  consequences  of  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition to monopolize violence. He discerned four important stages in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the functioning of economies over the past thousand years, each involving a</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent phase in the organization of violence. <a href="#calibre_link-11">II</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">206</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-156"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Out of the Dark Ages</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rst  stage  is  one  of  “anarchy  and  plunder”  that  marked  the  feudal</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolution of a thousand years ago. While Lane does not specify the dates for</p>
<p class="calibre1">any of his summary periods, arithmetic sets the boundary of his  rst period</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite clearly, and his description of the stage of “anarchy and plunder” seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to match conditions during the transition from the Dark Ages when the use</p>
<p class="calibre1">of violence was “highly competitive, even on land.” <a href="#calibre_link-13">44 </a>He does not say why, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but when violence is “highly competitive,” this usual y means that there are</p>
<p class="calibre1">signi cant  obstacles  to  the  projection  of  power  at  any  distance.  In  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms, defense is predominant over the o ense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For reasons we explained in Chapter 3, this stage of “anarchy and plunder” </p>
<p class="calibre1">coincided  with  fal ing  productivity  of  agriculture  due  to  adverse  climatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes. Since technology o ered few e ective economies of scale to help in</p>
<p class="calibre1">securing a monopoly of violence at the time, competition between would-be</p>
<p class="calibre1">rulers was widespread. Economic activity was smothered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weakness of the economy made the problem of establishing a stable</p>
<p class="calibre1">order worse. To create a local monopoly of violence involved too high a cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">in military activity in proportion to the meager value of economic turnover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without the capacity to enforce an e ective monopoly over an economical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">viable  territory,  the  armed  knights  on  horseback  terrorized  and  plundered</p>
<p class="calibre1">while providing little in the way of “protection” for their customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Feudalism</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“The second stage begins when smal  regional or provincial monopolies are</p>
<p class="calibre1">established.  Agricultural  production  then  rises,  and  most  of  the  surplus  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ected by recently established monopolists of violence.” <a href="#calibre_link-13">45</a> Stil , the surplus is relatively meager during this second stage, which we identify with the early</p>
<p class="calibre1">Middle Ages. Economic growth is held down by the absence of advantages of</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale  in  the  organization  of  violence,  which  keeps  the  military  costs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">enforcing local monopolies high. But while the costs remain high, the price</p>
<p class="calibre1">that minisovereignties can charge for protection rises, since economic activity</p>
<p class="calibre1">expands when anarchy is curtailed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">207</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-157"></a>“During  a  late  phase  of  the  second  stage  many  tribute  takers  attract</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers by special o ers to agricultural and commercial enterprise. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">o er  protection  at  low  prices  for  those  who  wil   bring  new  lands  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultivation,  and  special  policing  services  to  encourage  trade  such  as  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  by  the  Counts  of  Champagne  for  merchants  coming  to  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fairs. <a href="#calibre_link-13">”46</a> In other words, when they were able to establish a su cient control</p>
<p class="calibre1">over territory to negotiate credibly, local warlords did what local merchants</p>
<p class="calibre1">do when they need to increase market share: they discounted their services to</p>
<p class="calibre1">attract  customers.  The  warlords  later  used  the  added  resources  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">additional  economic  activity  to  consolidate  their  control  over  larger</p>
<p class="calibre1">territories. Once that control was  rmly established, they began to enjoy more</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the advantages of monopoly. Their military costs for policing tended to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal , and they could also increase the price they charged without worrying that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this made their service less attractive to customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this complicated stage in Western history, those who employ violence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the medieval lords and monarchs, take most of the surplus above subsistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are few merchants. The most successful are those who are best able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">evade  or  minimize  the  taxes,  fees,  and  other  costs  imposed  by  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanding money for “protection services.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Early-Modern Period</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A third stage is reached when the merchants and landowners who are not also</p>
<p class="calibre1">specialists in violence “are getting more of the economy’s surplus than are  ef</p>
<p class="calibre1">holders and monarchs.… In this third stage, the enterprises specializing in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  of  violence  receive  less  of  the  surplus  than  do  enterprises  that  buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  from  the  governments.” <a href="#calibre_link-13">47</a>  Since  successful  merchants  are  more likely  to  reinvest  their  pro ts  than  consume  them,  the  higher  pro ts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchants in that stage in history led to self-reinforcing growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Factory Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane  identi es  the  passage  from  the  third  to  the  fourth  stage  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergence  of  technological  and  industrial  innovations  as  more  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">factors in earning pro ts than lowering the costs of protection. By this, Lane</p>
<p class="calibre1">208</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-486"></a>seems to refer to the period since 1750. From that time on, the character of</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  began  to  play  a  clearly  dominating  role  in  the  prosperity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">regions. To take an extreme case, even areas where no government existed at</p>
<p class="calibre1">al , as was the case in some parts of New Zealand, for example, prior to 1840, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  likely  to  become  highly  prosperous  simply  because  they  paid  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes.  At  that  point  in  history,  innovations  in  industrial  technology  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">more important to achieving pro ts than any savings that could be had by</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowering the costs for protection, even to zero. As the scale of government</p>
<p class="calibre1">rose,  the  credit  and  nancing  mechanisms  original y  pioneered  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  to  raise  resources  for  military  operations  became  available  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nance business enterprises of larger scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Lane  does  not  say  so,  the  concentration  of  technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages  in  a  given  locale  reduced  the  competition  between  jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">and al owed “enterprises specializing in the use of violence,” or governments, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to charge higher prices. When there are large technological gaps between the</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitors  in  one  jurisdiction  and  another,  as  there  were  during  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial  Age,  entrepreneurs  in  the  jurisdictions  with  the  best  technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend to make more money, even though they may have to pay higher taxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and other costs to their governments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Plunder with a Smile</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments in the Industrial Age enjoyed a delightful monopoly to exploit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their actual costs for providing protection of life and limb were vanishingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  relative to the prices (taxes) they charged. Yet they real y were in a realm</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  competition  was  so  perverse  that  they  could  engage  far  more  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">business of plunder than in that of protection and stil  have that fact go al</p>
<p class="calibre1">but unnoticed. It was a rare moment in history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  drawbacks  of  anarchy  under  the  megapolitical  conditions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism  made  competition  in  protection  services  within  the  same</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory  technological y  infeasible.  The  only  way  to  achieve  e ective</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  under  those  conditions  was  to  command  a  greater  capability  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">employ  violence.  Therefore  there  was  little  to  be  gained  by  attempting  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">better distinguish that portion of one’s taxes that went, in Lane’s words, “as</p>
<p class="calibre1">payment for the service rendered” from “another part that one is tempted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">209</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-158"></a>cal  plunder.” <a href="#calibre_link-13">48  </a>The  distinction  was  surely  real  enough.  But  since  one  was stuck paying the taxes in any event, developing it ful y had little to commend</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  other  than  satisfying  morbid  curiosity.  As  Lane  said,  no  matter  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion of the taxes was plunder they were a price one had to pay “to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">more severe losses. <a href="#calibre_link-13">”49</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Rise of Incomes Under Industrialism</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Part of the reason this dilemma was tolerable during the past two centuries of</p>
<p class="calibre1">domination  by  the  nation-state  was  the  fact  that  incomes  were  rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatical y,  particularly  in  the  jurisdictions  where  most  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">development was con ned. Those running the OECD governments took a</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher percentage of incomes almost every year. But the increase in plunder</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  nonetheless  accompanied  by  far  greater  prosperity,  and  a  greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">inequality  of  wealth  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  Under  such  conditions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">objections to the surge of taxation were inevitably marginal and insu cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  de ect  events  from  their  logical  progression.  Indeed,  for  reasons  spel ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  in  previous  chapters,  the  military  survival  of  an  industrial  nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">largely depended upon the fact that no e ective limits could be placed upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">its claims on the resources of its citizens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  every  industrial  state,  policies  meandered  in  more  or  less  the  same</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction.  At  the  high-water  mark  of  industrialism  after  World  War  II,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rate  of  marginal  income  taxes  reached  90  percent  or  higher.  This  was  a  far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  aggressive  assertion  of  the  right  of  the  state  to  extract  resources  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">even the Oriental despots of the early hydraulic civilizations were prone to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make. Yet the industrial version of plunder fol owed its own logic. Much of it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was determined by the character of industrial technology in the  rst half of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twentieth century that we described earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This technology made it al  but inevitable that the state would seize and</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribute  a  large  fraction  of  income,  with  much  of  the  burden  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plunder fal ing upon a smal  segment of capitalists. Most industrial processes</p>
<p class="calibre1">were heavily dependent on natural resources, and therefore tied to the sites</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  the  resources  were  located.  A  steel  mil ,  a  mine,  or  a  port  could  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved only at staggering expense, or not at al . Such facilities were therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">stationary  targets  that  could  easily  be  taxed.  Property,  corporate,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">210</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-407"></a>severance taxes grew sharply over this century. So did income taxes,  rst on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the capitalists, but eventual y on the workers themselves. The advent of large-</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale  industrial  employment  made  a  broadly  based  income  tax  practical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wages could be garnished at the source, with the tax authorities coordinating</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ections with the accounting departments of industrial  rms. We take this</p>
<p class="calibre1">for granted today, but col ecting an income tax at the factory gate was a far</p>
<p class="calibre1">simpler task than fanning out over the countryside to squeeze a portion of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pro ts from mil ions of independent craftsmen and farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, industrial technology tended to make taxation more routinized, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more predictable, and less personal y dangerous than taxation in many earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1">periods. Nonetheless, it extracted a higher percentage of society’s resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">than any form of sovereignty had done before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Protecting What? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  societies  could  become  richer  while  the  total  percentage  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">income  absorbed  in  taxes  rose  signi cantly  invites  a  question  about  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">character  of  the  protection  that  governments  provided  to  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies.  What  were  they  protecting?  Our  answer:  primarily  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">instal ations  with  high  capital  costs  and  signi cant  vulnerability  to  attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presence of large-scale industrial  rms would not have been possible in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disordered environment with more competitive violence, even if the result of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  competition  had  been  to  shrink  the  overal   share  of  output  taken  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why capital-intensive operations are uneconomic in the American</p>
<p class="calibre1">slums, as wel  as in Third World societies where ad hoc violence is endemic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial  society  as  a  whole  was  able  to  proceed  because  a  certain  kind  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">order  was  established  and  maintained.  Enterprises  were  subject  to  regular, </p>
<p class="calibre1">predictable shakedowns, rather than erratic violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even during the height of industrialism, it was always an exaggeration to</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak of a government employing a “monopoly of force.” Al  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to maintain such a monopoly, but as we have seen, employees of industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations  usual y  found  that  they  were  able  to  employ  violence  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">their employers. As long as the general public has access to any arms at al , or a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disorderly  crowd  retains  the  physical  capacity  to  overturn  a  bus  or  throw</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Information Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Information Age is bringing into being a  fth stage in the evolution of</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition in the use of violence in the West. This stage was not anticipated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  Lane.  This  fth  phase  involves  competition  in  cyberspace,  an  arena  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject  to  monopolization  by  any  “violence-using  enterprise.”  It  is  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject to monopolization because it is not a territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Lane’s  argument  incorporates  conventional  postwar</p>
<p class="calibre1">assumptions about the inevitability of the nation-state, he recognized a point</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wil  be more crucial to understanding the future than it may have seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">forty  or  fty  years  ago.  That  is  the  fact  that  governments  have  never</p>
<p class="calibre1">established stable monopolies of coercion over the open sea. Think about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No government’s laws have ever exclusively applied there. This is a matter of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  utmost  importance  in  understanding  how  the  organization  of  violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">and protection wil  evolve as the economy migrates into cyberspace, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  no  physical  existence  at  al .  For  the  same  reasons  that  Lane  noted  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">observing that no government has ever been able to monopolize violence on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sea, it is even less likely that a government could successful y monopolize</p>
<p class="calibre1">an in nite realm without physical boundaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">COMPETITION WITHOUT ANARCHY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">212</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-160"></a>In the past, when conditions made it di cult for any single violence-wielding</p>
<p class="calibre1">entity  to  establish  a  monopoly,  the  results  were  anarchy  and  plunder.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age, however, has changed the technological terms under which</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence is organized and done so in a profound way. Unlike the past, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the inability to monopolize protection in a region meant higher military costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and lower economic returns, the fact that governments cannot monopolize</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace actual y implies lower military costs and higher economic returns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  because  information  technology  creates  a  new  dimension  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection.  For  the  rst  time  in  history,  information  technology  al ows  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the creation and protection of assets that lie entirely outside the realm of any</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;REES DAVIES</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Analogy with the Frontier</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberspace  is  in  one  sense  the  equivalent  of  a  technological y  protected</p>
<p class="calibre1">march region of the kind that existed in border areas during the Middle Ages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the past, when the reach of lords and kings was weak, and the claims of</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  or  more  overlapped  at  a  frontier,  something  akin  to  competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">government existed. A look at how the march regions functioned could give</p>
<p class="calibre1">insights into how laws of the march or something like them may migrate into</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andorra survives as a kind of fossilized march region between France and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spain, an artifact of megapolitical conditions that made it di cult for either</p>
<p class="calibre1">kingdom to dominate the other in that cold and almost inaccessible area of</p>
<p class="calibre1">190 square miles in the Pyrenees. In 1278, an agreement was struck dividing</p>
<p class="calibre1">suzerainty over Andorra between local French and Spanish feudal lords, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">French count of Foix and the Spanish bishop of Urgel. Each appointed one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  two  “viquiers”  who  sparingly  exercised  the  minimal  authority  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government in Andorra, mostly by commanding the tiny Andorran militia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">now a police force. The count’s role was long ago superseded by history. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">213</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-403"></a>French government now stands in for him from Paris. Among its duties is to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accept half of the annual tribute that Andorra pays, an amount less than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single month’s rent in a  eabag apartment. The bishop of Urgel continues to</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive his share of the tribute, just as his predecessors did in the Middle Ages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the split tribute implies, there have been two sources of “supervisory</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction and power” rather than one in Andorra. Appeals from Andorran</p>
<p class="calibre1">civil suits were traditional y lodged either with the Episcopal Col ege of Urgel</p>
<p class="calibre1">or the Court of Cassation in Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A consequence of Andorra’s ambiguous position was that almost no laws</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  enacted.  Andorra  has  enjoyed  vanishingly  smal   government  and  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes for more than seven hundred years. Today, that gives it a growing appeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a tax haven. But until a generation ago, Andorra was famously poor. Once</p>
<p class="calibre1">thickly wooded, it was deforested over the centuries by residents trying to stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm in the bitter winters. The whole place is snowed shut from November</p>
<p class="calibre1">through April each year. Even in summer, Andorra is so cold that crops grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">only on the southern slopes. If our description makes it seem unappealing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you have just learned the secret of its success. Andorra survived as a feudal</p>
<p class="calibre1">enclave in the age of the nation-state because it was remote and dirt-poor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At one time, there were numerous medieval frontier or “march” regions</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  sovereignties  blended  together.  These  violent  frontiers  persisted  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades or sometimes for centuries in the border areas of Europe. Most were</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor. As we mentioned earlier, there were marches between areas of Celtic</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  English  control  in  Ireland;  between  Wales  and  England,  Scotland  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">England, Italy and France, France and Spain, Germany and the Slav frontiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Central  Europe,  and  between  the  Christian  kingdoms  of  Spain  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Islamic kingdom of Granada. Like Andorra, these march regions developed</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinct institutional and legal forms of a kind that we are likely to see again in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the next mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, each of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  weak,  rulers  would  sometimes  even  solicit  volunteers  among  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects  to  settle  in  march  regions  in  order  to  increase  the  reach  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority. Almost as a matter of course, the subjects were lured into settling</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the march by freedom from taxes. Given the delicate margins upon which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they competed, if either authority in a march attempted to impose taxes, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would make it more di cult for his fol owers to make ends meet, as wel  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">214</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-390"></a>give everyone a reason to a liate with his competitor. Therefore, residents of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a march usual y had a choice in deciding whose laws they were to obey. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice was based upon the weakness of the competing authorities; it was not</p>
<p class="calibre1">an ideological gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  practical  di culties  arose  that  had  to  be  resolved.  Under</p>
<p class="calibre1">feudalism, landlords who owned property on both sides of a nominal frontier</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced  a  serious  con ict  of  duties.  For  example,  a  lord  on  the  frontier  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scotland  and  England  who  held  properties  in  both  kingdoms  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">theoretical y owe military service to both in the event of war. To resolve this</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradictory obligation, almost everyone up and down the feudal hierarchy</p>
<p class="calibre1">could choose whose laws to obey through a legal process cal ed avowal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  wil   create  equivalent  opportunities  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  choice  in  domiciling  economic  activities,  but  with  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erences.  One  is  that  unlike  the  medieval  frontier  societies,  cyberspace  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely  to  be  in  due  course  the  richest  of  economic  realms.  It  wil   therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend to be a growing rather than a receding frontier. Few persons at the core</p>
<p class="calibre1">regions of medieval society would have wished to move to frontiers without</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong  inducements,  often  including  religious  imperatives,  because  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">regions tended to be violent and poor. Therefore, they did not act as magnets</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing resources out of the control of the authorities. Cyberspace wil . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, the new frontier wil  not be a duopoly, which invites col usion</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the two authorities to compromise over their frontier claims. Such</p>
<p class="calibre1">compromises tended not to be e ective during the medieval period for two</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons:  there  were  frequently  sharp  cultural  gaps  between  the  rival</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities; and more important, they lacked the physical capacity to impose</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  negotiated  settlement,  having  insu cient  military  power  on  the  ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  era  of  the  nation-state,  when  national  authorities  did  come  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise  su cient  military  power  to  impose  solutions,  most  march  regions</p>
<p class="calibre1">and vague frontiers disappeared. Border  xing became the norm. That is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stable  solution  if  duopolists  of  violence  face  the  prospect  of  dividing  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority  over  contiguous  regions.  But  the  competition  in  domiciling</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions in the cybereconomy wil  not be between two authorities, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  hundreds  of  authorities  throughout  the  globe.  For  the  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">states  to  create  an  e ective  cartel  to  keep  tax  rates  high  wil   be  al   but</p>
<p class="calibre1">215</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-161"></a>impossible.  This  wil   be  true  for  the  same  reason  that  col usion  to  enjoy monopoly prices in markets with hundreds of competitors does not work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For evidence, consider the move by the Seychel es, a tiny country in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indian Ocean, to enact a new investment law that U.S. government o cials</p>
<p class="calibre1">describe as a “Welcome Criminals” act. Under the law, anyone who invests</p>
<p class="calibre1">$10 mil ion in the Seychel es wil  not only be guaranteed protection against</p>
<p class="calibre1">extradition,  but  wil   be  issued  a  diplomatic  passport.  Contrary  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assertions of the U.S. government, however, the intended bene ciaries are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">drug  dealers,  who  are  general y  under  the  protection  of  more  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments in any event, but independent entrepreneurs who have become</p>
<p class="calibre1">political y incorrect. The  rst potential bene ciary of the Seychel es law is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">white  South  African  who  became  wealthy  by  circumventing  the  economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanctions  against  the  former  apartheid  regime.  Now  he  faces  the  danger  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic retribution by the new South African government and is wil ing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay the Seychel es for protection. <a href="#calibre_link-13">52</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever  the  merits  of  any  individual  case,  the  example  shows  why</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts by governments to maintain a cartel for protection on the ground</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  doomed  to  failure.  Unlike  the  medieval  frontier,  in  which  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  was  between  two  authorities  only,  the  frontier  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercommerce wil  be between hundreds of jurisdictions, with the number</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably rising rapidly to thousands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the age of the virtual corporation, individuals wil  choose to domicile</p>
<p class="calibre1">their income-earning activities in a jurisdiction that provides the best service</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the lowest cost. In other words, sovereignty wil  be commercialized. Unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval  frontier  societies,  which  were  in  most  cases  impoverished  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent,  cyberspace  wil   be  neither.  The  competition  that  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  is  driving  governments  to  engage  in  is  not  competition  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">military kind, but competition in quality and price of an economic service &mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine protection. In short, governments wil  be obliged to give customers</p>
<p class="calibre1">what they want. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Diminished Utility of Violence</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  governments  wil   resign  from  employing</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence. Far from it. Rather, what we are saying is that violence is losing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">216</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-487"></a>good deal of its leverage. One possible reaction on the part of governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be to intensify their use of violence in local settings in an attempt to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compensate for its declining global signi cance. Whatever governments do, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, they wil  be unable to saturate cyberspace with violence in the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  saturated  the  territories  they  monopolized  with  violence  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern world. No matter how many governments try to enter cyberspace, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they wil  be no more capable or powerful in that realm than anyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironical y,  attempts  by  nation-states  to  wage  “information  wars”  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominate or thwart access to cyberspace would probably only accelerate their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own demise. The tendency toward the devolution of large systems is already</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful because of the fal away of scale economies and the rising costs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding fragmenting social groups together. The irony of information wars is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they could wel  impose more of a shock to the brittle systems left over</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the Industrial Age than to the emerging information economy itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  long  as  essential  information  technology  continues  to  function, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercommerce could proceed in tandem with the struggles of information</p>
<p class="calibre1">war  in  a  way  that  could  never  happen  in  a  territorial  war.  You  could  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine mil ions of commercial transactions taking place at the front in one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  twentieth  century’s  wars.  But  virtual  wars  may  not  exhaust  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity of cyberspace to host multiple activities. And because virtual reality</p>
<p class="calibre1">does  not  exist,  there  wil   be  little  danger  of  proximity,  and  almost  none  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being hit by exploding virtual shrapnel. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  dangers  of  information  war  wil   mostly  be  dangers  to  large-scale</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  assumptions  of  the  nation-state  at  war  wil   make  less  and  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  sense  as  the  importance  of  information  in  warfare  increases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  it  has  no  physical  existence,  cyberspace  is  not  a  realm  in  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnitudes as we know them in the physical world carry any commanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance.  It  does  not  matter  how  many  programmers  were  involved  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">stipulating a sequence of commands. Al  that matters is whether the program</p>
<p class="calibre1">functions.  The  Sovereign  Individual  may  truly  count  for  as  much  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace as does a nation-state, with its seat in the UN, its own  ag, and an</p>
<p class="calibre1">218</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-319"></a>army  deployed  on  the  ground.  In  purely  economic  terms,  some  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals already command investible incomes in the hundreds of mil ions</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual y, sums that exceed the discretionary spending power of some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bankrupt nation-states. But that is not al . In terms of virtual warfare waged</p>
<p class="calibre1">through  the  manipulation  of  information,  some  individuals  may  loom  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">large or larger than many of the world’s states. One bizarre genius, working</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  digital  servants,  could  theoretical y  achieve  the  same  impact  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberwar as a nation-state. Bil  Gates certainly could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this sense, the age of the Sovereign Individual is not merely a slogan. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">hacker, or a smal  group of mathematicians, not to mention a company like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Microsoft, or almost any computer software company, could in principle do</p>
<p class="calibre1">any or al  of the things that the Pentagon’s Cyber War Task Force has up its</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeves. There are hundreds of  rms in the Silicon Val ey and elsewhere that</p>
<p class="calibre1">already  have  a  greater  capacity  to  wage  a  cyberwar  than  90  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">existing nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Events  of  1998  brought  testimony  from  the  U.S.  President  and  his  top</p>
<p class="calibre1">aides  that  the  leading  enemy  of  the  United  States  was  not  another  nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">state, but Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi mil ionaire. The claim that Bin</p>
<p class="calibre1">Laden, an individual, was a signi cant threat to the greatest military power of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Industrial Age was backed up by a barrage of cruise missiles. We are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether convinced that Bin Laden was not merely picked out to play the</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of the “Richard Jewel  of the Nairobi bombing.” But be that as it may, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  individual  like  Bin  Laden  could  be  convincing  as  a  dire  threat  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United  States  as  a  terrorist,  he  or  another  multimil ionaire  could  be  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more convincing as a cyberterrorist, for cybertechnology puts individuals at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lesser disadvantage in confronting large groups than they face in the realm of</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosives and missiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presumption that governments wil  continue to monopolize life on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  ground  as  alternative  avenues  for  protection  open  on  al   sides  is  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronism. A far more likely outcome is that nation-states wil  have to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">recon gured to reduce their vulnerability to computer viruses, logic bombs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">infected wires, and trapdoor programs that could be monitored by the U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">National Security Agency, or some teenage hacker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The megapolitical logic of cyberspace suggests that central command-and-</p>

<p class="calibre1">219</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-163"></a>wil  have to be replaced by multicentric models of security with distributed</p>
<p class="calibre1">capabilities so they cannot be easily captured or blocked by a computer virus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New types of software, known as agoric open systems, wil  replace command-</p>
<p class="calibre1">and-control software inherited from the Industrial Age. That older software</p>
<p class="calibre1">al ocated  computational  capacity  according  to  rigid  priorities  in  much  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same way that the central planners at Gosplan in the former Soviet Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">used  to  al ocate  goods  to  boxcars  by  rigid  rules.  The  new  systems  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed by algorithms that mock market mechanisms to al ocate resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">more e ciently by an internal bidding process that mimics the competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes  in  the  brain.  Instead  of  giant  computer  monopolies  conducting</p>
<p class="calibre1">important command-and-control functions, they wil  be decentralized in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  better  example  of  the  resilience  of  distributed  networks</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared  to  command-and-control  systems  than  that  given  by  Digital</p>
<p class="calibre1">Equipment at its Palo Alto research lab. An engineer opened the door to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">closet that housed the company’s own computer network. As recounted by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin Kel y, the engineer dramatical y “yanked a cable out of its guts. The</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Information Age wil  not only facilitate competition without anarchy</p>
<p class="calibre1">in cyberspace; it wil  inevitably lead to the redesign of important systems left</p>
<p class="calibre1">over from industrialism. Such a recon guration is essential to make them less</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerable to mischief that could come from anyone or anywhere. Just as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial Age inevitably led to the recon guration of institutions that were</p>
<p class="calibre1">left  over  from  the  medieval  period,  such  as  schools  and  universities,  so  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leftover institutions of the Industrial Age are likely to devolve in miniature</p>
<p class="calibre1">form, in ways that re ect the logic of microtechnology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The need for protection against bandits on the Information Superhighway</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   require  widespread  adopting  of  public  key-private  key  encryption</p>
<p class="calibre1">algorithms. These already al ow any individual user of a personal computer to</p>
<p class="calibre1">encode  any  message  more  securely  than  the  Pentagon  could  have  sealed  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">launch codes only a generation ago. These powerful, unbreakable forms of</p>
<p class="calibre1">encryption wil  be necessary to secure  nancial transactions from hackers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thieves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  wil   also  be  necessary  for  another  reason.  Private  nancial</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions and central banks wil  adopt unbreakable encryption algorithms</p>
<p class="calibre1">220</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-422"></a>when they realize that the U.S. government&mdash;and it may not be alone&mdash;has</p>

<p class="calibre1">U.S. National Security Agency or the successors to the KGB, or any similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization, licit or il icit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Encryption algorithms impenetrable by governments are not daydreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  are  available  already  as  shareware  over  the  Internet.  When  low-orbit</p>
<p class="calibre1">satel ite  systems  are  ful y  operable,  individuals  using  advanced  personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">computers  with  antennae  no  larger  than  those  on  portable  phones  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to communicate anywhere on the globe without even interfacing with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  telephone  system.  It  wil   no  more  be  possible  for  a  government  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolize  cyberspace,  a  realm  with  no  physical  existence  at  al ,  than  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would have been for medieval knights to control transactions in the industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">period astride a heavy charger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Protection by Stealth</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Information societies wil  place vast resources outside the realm of predation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When cyberspace comes increasingly to host  nancial transactions and other</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms  of  commerce,  the  resources  employed  there  wil   be  more  or  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">immune  to  ordinary  shakedowns  and  theft.  Therefore,  predators  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable to harness as large a share of resources as they do today and have done</p>
<p class="calibre1">through much of the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably, therefore, government protection of a large part of the world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth wil  be redundant. Government wil  be no better situated to protect a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bank balance in cyberspace than you are. As government wil  be less necessary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">its relative price is likely to fal  for that reason alone. There are others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  a  large  and  growing  share  of  nancial  transactions  occurring  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace  in  the  new  mil ennium,  individuals  wil   have  a  choice  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions in which to lodge them. This wil  create intense competition to</p>
<p class="calibre1">price government’s services (the taxes it charges) on a nonmonopolistic basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is revolutionary. As George Mel oan argued in  <i class="calibre4">The Wall Street Journal, </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">pervasiveness,  but  also  for  the  common  misunderstanding  it  betrays  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cybereconomy. A highway, after al , is an industrial version of a footpath, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a  network  for  the  physical  transit  of  people  and  goods.  The  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy is not like a highway, a railroad, or a pipeline. It does not haul or</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport  information  from  point  to  point  the  way  the  Trans-Canada</p>
<p class="calibre1">Highway  carries  heavy  trucks  from  Alberta  to  New  Brunswick.  What  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world cal s the “Information Superhighway” is not merely a transit link. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cyberspace  transcends  locality.  It  involves  nothing  less  than  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantaneous  sharing  of  data  everywhere  and  nowhere  at  once.  The</p>

<p class="calibre1">relinking mil ions of users of mil ions of computers. Its essence lies in the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities that arise from these connections. As John Perry Barlow put it, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE TYRANNY OF PLACE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fact  that  the  fading  industrial  era’s  rst  stab  at  conceiving  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  economy  is  to  think  of  it  in  terms  of  a  gigantic  public  works</p>
<p class="calibre1">project tel s you how grounded our thinking is in the paradigms of the past. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is rather like hearing farmers at the end of the eighteenth century describe a</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory  as  “a  farm  with  a  roof.”  Yet  the  “superhighway”  metaphor  is  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">revealing than that. It also betrays the extent to which we are hostage to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tyranny of place. Even when technology enables us to transcend locality, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">instrument  of  our  deliverance  is  given  a  nickname  describing  it  as  a  route</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  place  to  place.  Like  salmon  marked  by  their  homing  instinct,  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness is stil  deeply etched by notions of locality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  whole  of  history  until  now,  economies  have  been  tethered  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">local  geographic  area.  Most  people  who  lived  before  the  twentieth  century</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed their days like  <i class="calibre4">de facto</i> prisoners under house arrest, seldom venturing</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  than  a  few  days’  walk  from  where  they  were  born.  A  journey  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance was the work of generations. Only occasional y did some crisis&mdash;war, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pestilence, an adverse shift in climate&mdash;stimulate a broad migration. To move</p>
<p class="calibre1">224</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-166"></a>human beings out of a wretched vil age required something spectacular and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressing. Nothing less could stimulate people to bundle up their belongings</p>
<p class="calibre1">and wander o  in search of a better life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until  recently,  the  few  who  looked  outside  their  own  locale  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  often  became  famous.  Consider  that  Marco  Polo  is  stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">renowned for having traipsed the Eurasian continent to visit the court of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great Khan. He was the exception in his time. Few other travelogues survive</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  premodern  period.  Among  the  more  widely  read,  <i class="calibre4">Mandeville’s</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Travels, </i> written in French in 1357, is notable for having been composed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone who probably never left Europe. Mandevil e conveys delightful and</p>
<p class="calibre1">often fanciful details about life around the globe, including the suggestion</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  many  Ethiopians  have  only  one  foot:  “[T]he  foot  is  so  large  that  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadoweth al  the body against the sun when they wil  lie and rest them.” <a href="#calibre_link-13">3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, few of Mandevil e’s contemporaries who read his popular story were</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely to have known that his Ethiopian “Bigfoot” did not exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not until the modern age began with the journeys of exploration at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very end of the  fteenth century were there sustained contacts between the</p>
<p class="calibre1">continents. Intrepid captains like Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  set  out  to  capture  the  spice  trade  were  extraordinary  enough  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered in every literate household for the better part of  ve centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the advent of farming until recent generations, life was characterized</p>
<p class="calibre1">by its immobility. This is al  but forgotten today, particularly in the European</p>
<p class="calibre1">settlement colonies of the “New World,” where movement is more  uid and</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone  tends  to  draw  his  perspective  from  the  vantage  point  of  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrant. A theme of elementary education in North America is that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonists came from Europe seeking freedom and opportunity, which is true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is seldom told, however, is how reluctant most people were to take the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trip,  even  when  faced  with  destitution  at  home.  The  few  who  did  migrate</p>
<p class="calibre1">su ered  what  are  in  today’s  terms  unimaginable  ordeals  to  establish</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves.  Only  the  most  enterprising  or  the  most  desperate  of  the  poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">came.  In  the  middle  of  the  seventeenth  century,  inmates  locked  up  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bridewel , London’s notorious house of correction, revolted to show “their</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwil ingness to go to Virginia. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”4 </a>In 1720, there were riots in the streets of</p>

<p class="calibre1">closed vil age life. Even now, as we write, at least a bil ion people, mostly in</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">“ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To a greater extent than is commonly realized, the immobility of people and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  assets  has  informed  the  way  we  see  the  world.  Even  those  who  seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">most ready to agree that the earth is a smal  place as the twentieth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">ends  continue  to  think  in  terms  constrained  by  antiquated  concepts  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  politics.  This  is  underscored  by  a  slogan  that  became  popular</p>
<p class="calibre1">among environmentalists in the 1980s: “Think global y but act local y.” It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">an injunction that mirrors the logic of politics, a logic that has always turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">on local power advantages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The local habit of mind has been dictated by the megapolitics of al  past</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies. Al  topographical features that serve as barriers or facilitators to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise of power are local. Every river, every mountain, every island is local. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Climate is local. Temperature, rainfal , and growing conditions vary as you</p>
<p class="calibre1">climb  up  and  over  a  mountain.  Every  microbe  that  circulates,  circulates</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere, and not in some other place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little  wonder  that  the  tyranny  of  place  permeates  our  concepts  of  how</p>
<p class="calibre1">society must organize and function. The power advantages that have given</p>
<p class="calibre1">one group or another a local monopoly on violence have heretofore always</p>
<p class="calibre1">226</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-167"></a>originated  someplace  and  faded  along  the  megapolitical  margins  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">borders are drawn. That is why there has never been a world government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  importance  of  place  to  the  exercise  of  power  has  rarely  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">made explicit, some advocates of compulsion to redistribute the rewards of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human action began to sense the declining leverage of place as long ago as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1930s. They saw in modern transportation a division of social space between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the highly paid and the poor. This fear was captured by John Dos Passos in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Big Money:</i> “The ‘vag’ sits on the edge of the highway, broken, hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overhead,  ies  a  transcontinental  plane  l ed  with  highly  paid  executives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upper class has taken to the air, the lower class to the road: there is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer any bond between them, they are two nations. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”5</a> This is another way</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  saying  that  improved  transportation  reduced  the  leverage  of  extortion</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply  by  increasing  the  choice  of  places  where  successful  persons  might</p>
<p class="calibre1">choose to be. Certainly, the vagabond on the road below was in no position</p>
<p class="calibre1">to press for a handout from those  ying overhead. The tendencies that Dos</p>
<p class="calibre1">Passos observed sixty years ago have only become more pronounced. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In 1995, a mil ion persons crossed borders somewhere in the world each day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This represents a startling change from the past. Before the twentieth century, </p>
<p class="calibre1">travel was so infrequent that most borders were simply frontiers, not barriers</p>
<p class="calibre1">to transit. Passports were unknown. The development of ocean liners, trains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  other  improved  forms  of  transportation  dramatical y  increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement.  But  this  movement  became  more  heavily  regulated  by  states</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose  powers  were  increased  by  the  same  improvements  in  transportation</p>
<p class="calibre1">and communications that made civilian travel cheaper and easier. The advent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of movies and, especial y, television also did a great deal to open horizons and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulate travel and immigration. Yet until now, the bedrock assumptions of</p>

<p class="calibre1">The  geographic  tether  on  imagination  is  stil   so  tight  that  some  experts</p>
<p class="calibre1">examining  the  Internet  in  1995  concluded  that  it  has  little  commercial</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential and almost no signi cance other than as an electronic medium for</p>
<p class="calibre1">chat  and  an  outlet  for  pornography.  The  many  doubters  of  the  economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  cyberspace  are  the  Colonel  Blimps  of  the  Information  Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their complacency rivals that of the British establishment facing the decline</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the empire in the 1930s. Whenever elites  nd themselves threatened, their</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst reaction is denial. This is evidenced by the fond hope that the Internet</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  never amount to much, sometimes endorsed by authorities who should</p>
<p class="calibre1">know better. We referred earlier to David Kline and Daniel Burstein’s work, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Road  Warriors:  Dreams  and  Nightmares  Along  the  Information  Highway. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Their dismissal of the economic potential of the Net is another proof that</p>

<p class="calibre1">consequences of technology<a href="#calibre_link-16">,7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  the  most  technical y  expert  observers  in  the  past  have  frequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed to grasp the implications of new technologies. A British parliamentary</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee, convened in 1878 to consider the prospects for Thomas Edison’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">incandescent  lamp,  reported  Edison’s  ideas  to  be  “good  enough  for  our</p>
<p class="calibre1">transatlantic friends,… but unworthy of the attention of practical or scienti c</p>
<p class="calibre1">men.” <a href="#calibre_link-16">8 </a>Thomas Edison himself was a man of great vision, but he thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the phonograph he invented would be employed mainly by businessmen</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  dictation.  Only  a  short  time  before  the  Wright  brothers  proved  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">airplanes  would  y,  the  distinguished  American  astronomer  Simon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Newcomb  authoritatively  demonstrated  why  heavier-than-air  ight  was</p>

<p class="calibre1">Given this tradition of clueless misunderstandings, it is hardly surprising</p>
<p class="calibre1">that many observers are slow to grasp the most important implications of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new information technology&mdash;the fact that it transcends the tyranny of place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new technology creates for the  rst time an in nite, nonterrestrial realm</p>
<p class="calibre1">for economic activity. It opens an option to explore the new frontiers of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy,  to  “think  global y  and  act  global y.”  This  chapter  explains</p>
<p class="calibre1">why. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEYOND LOCALITY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  processing  and  use  of  information  is  rapidly  replacing  and  modifying</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical  products  as  the  most  important  source  of  pro t.  This  has  major</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences.  Information  technology  divorces  income-earning  potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">from residence in any speci c geographic location. Since a greater and greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion of the value of products and services wil  be created by adding ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  knowledge  to  the  product,  an  ever-smal er  component  of  value-added</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  be subject to capture within local jurisdictions. Ideas can be formulated</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere  and  transmitted  global y  at  the  speed  of  light.  This  inevitably</p>
<p class="calibre1">means that the information economy wil  be dramatical y di erent from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy of the Factory Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We would concede to the critics that a recital of the tasks you could have</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertaken  through  the  Internet  in  1998  might  seem  mundane.  There  is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after  al ,  nothing  terribly  revolutionary  about  reading  an  article  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">gardening on the Net, or buying a case of wine long-distance. However, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential  of  the  cybereconomy  cannot  be  judged  solely  on  its  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginnings,  any  more  than  the  potential  of  the  automobile  to  transform</p>
<p class="calibre1">229</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-428"></a>society could have been judged by what you could have seen around you in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1900. We expect the cybereconomy to evolve through several stages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The most primitive manifestations of the Information Age involve the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Net  simply  as  an  information  medium  to  facilitate  what  are  otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary industrial-era transactions. At this point, the Net is no more than an</p>
<p class="calibre1">exotic delivery system for catalogues. Virtual Vineyards, for example, one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  rst cybermerchants, simply sel s wine from a page on the World Wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">Web. Such transactions are not yet directly subversive of the old institutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  employ  industrial  currency,  and  take  place  within  identi able</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions. These uses of the Internet have little such megapolitical impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. An intermediate stage of Internet commerce wil  employ information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  in  ways  that  would  have  been  impossible  in  the  industrial  era, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such as in long-distance accounting or medical diagnosis. More examples of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these  new  applications  of  advanced  computational  power  are  spel ed  out</p>
<p class="calibre1">below. The second stage of Net commerce wil  stil  function within the old</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutional  framework,  employing  national  currencies  and  submitting  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the jurisdiction of nation-states. The merchants who employ the Net for sales</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   not  yet  employ  it  to  bank  their  pro ts,  only  to  earn  revenues.  These</p>
<p class="calibre1">pro ts made on Internet transactions wil  stil  be subject to taxation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. A more advanced stage wil  mark the transition to true cybercommerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only wil  transactions occur over the Net, but they wil  migrate outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the jurisdiction of nation-states. Payment wil  be rendered in cybercurrency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pro ts  wil   be  booked  in  cyberbanks.  Investments  wil   be  made  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberbrokerages. Many transactions wil  not be subject to taxation. At this</p>
<p class="calibre1">stage,  cybercommerce  wil   begin  to  have  signi cant  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  of  the  kind  we  have  already  outlined.  The  powers  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments over traditional areas of the economy wil  be transformed by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  logic  of  the  Net.  Extraterritorial  regulatory  power  wil   col apse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jurisdictions wil  devolve. The structure of  rms wil  change, and so wil  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature of work and employment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This outline of the stages of the Information Revolution is only the barest</p>
<p class="calibre1">sketch of what could be the most far-reaching economic transformation ever. </p>

<p class="calibre1">230</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-488"></a>In  the  Information  Age,  most  current  jurisdictional  advantages  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">eroded rapidly by technology. New types of advantages wil  emerge. Fal ing</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications  costs  have  already  reduced  the  need  for  proximity  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary condition of doing business. In 1946, it was technical y possible for</p>
<p class="calibre1">an investor in London to place an order with a broker in New York. But only</p>
<p class="calibre1">the largest and most compel ing transaction would have justi ed doing so: a</p>
<p class="calibre1">three-minute phone cal  between New York and London cost $650. Today, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs $0.91. The price of an intercontinental phone cal  has plunged by more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than 99 percent in half a century. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Convergent Communication</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,  the  di erence  between  intercontinental  chat  and  a  local  cal   may  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">minimal.  So,  too,  may  be  the  di erences  among  your  telephone,  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer,  and  your  television.  Al   wil   be  interactive  communications</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices,  more  easily  distinguished  on  ergonomic  than  functional  grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  wil   be  able  to  hold  a  voice  conversation  over  the  Internet  using</p>
<p class="calibre1">microphones  and  speakers  on  your  personal  computer.  Or  watch  a  movie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  wil   be  able  to  talk  back  to  your  television,  and  communicate  vast</p>
<p class="calibre1">amounts  of  data  through  the  network  provided  by  the  television</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertainment media. As the industrial-era distinction between various forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  communication  breaks  down  and  costs  plunge,  more  and  more  services</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  bil  you by time of use rather than according to the destination of your</p>
<p class="calibre1">messages. Conversation or data transmission anywhere in the world wil  cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">little more than a local cal  did in most jurisdictions in 1985. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Internet Unwired</b></i></p>

<p class="calibre1">or a workstation, without interfacing with a local telephone operating or TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">cable system at al . In short, the Internet wil  be unwired. The  rst steps in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that direction are bound to be halting because of the relatively slow speed of</p>
<p class="calibre1">data transmission in the early wireless media and the di culties of “hearing” </p>

<p class="calibre1">231</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-489"></a>and battery-powered. Nonetheless, these technical problems wil  be tackled</p>

<p class="calibre1">costs. Simultaneous with the service, vendors wil  be able to debit accounts</p>

<p class="calibre1">surgery. It is one example, but a good one, of the way in which technology is</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  us  are  familiar  with  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines,  in  which  magnetic  resonance  techniques  are  used  to  provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctors with soft-tissue images for diagnostic purposes. They provide better</p>
<p class="calibre1">images of soft tissues than X-rays or ultrasound, and have become an essential</p>
<p class="calibre1">part  of  modern  diagnostic  techniques,  particularly  in  cancers.  They  have, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, two signi cant limitations at present. The tube does not al ow free</p>
<p class="calibre1">access to the patient; the machines are of limited power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Cybersurgery</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">General Electric has redesigned magnetic resonance machines so that they can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  used  for  treatment  as  wel   as  diagnosis.  The  power  has  been  upped  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">times. The tube has, in e ect, been cut in two, so the patient wil  lie between</p>
<p class="calibre1">two  doughnut-shaped  units,  rather  than  being  ful y  enclosed.  Instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking an image and then performing surgery in the light of that image, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgeon  wil   be  able  to  see  what  he  is  doing  as  he  does  it.  MRT  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">combined with noninvasive, or less invasive, surgery using microtechniques. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of having to make large incisions with scalpels, the surgeon wil  make</p>
<p class="calibre1">micro incisions with probes, and wil  be able to see what the probes reveal as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  operates.  He  wil   perform  the  surgery  from  the  image  rather  than  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking directly into the body. In principle, the probes wil  be operable from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  distance.  They  wil   be  able  to  destroy  tumors  with  laser  or  cryogenic&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">heating or freezing&mdash;devices of great precision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  wil   permit  operations  that  are  now  impossible,  particularly  in</p>

<p class="calibre1">236</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-404"></a>It wil  also permit repeated operations, when the trauma of the traditional</p>

<p class="calibre1">aftershock, wil  be taken out of surgery if that is true. Obviously, this is very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good news for the patient. Operations which now take hours to perform, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to be fol owed by days or weeks in the hospital, wil  take only half an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour, and may not require hospitalization at al . Indeed, the surgeon and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient  may  never  even  be  in  the  same  room.  But  what  wil   this  do  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hospitals and surgeons? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Fewer Microsurgeons Doing More</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There wil  be a revolution in surgery. In training, a third of young surgeons</p>
<p class="calibre1">have failed to acquire the skil s needed for microsurgery. A third are just able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  do  it,  and  a  third  become  excel ent.  Similar  proportions  are  found  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversion courses for senior surgeons. Fewer surgeons wil  be able to carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">out more operations in a shorter time. It is likely that health care insurers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals seeking surgery wil  insist on outcome statistics for each surgeon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which  wil   vary  rather  widely.  Patients  wil   want  to  go  to  surgeons  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce the best results, particularly if their conditions are life-threatening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  some  cases,  the  best  surgeons  may  operate  long-distance.  They  may</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Digital Lawyers</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  agreeing  to  perform  an  operation,  the  skil ed  surgeon  wil   probably</p>

<p class="calibre1">as  there  have  been  knives.  But  limits  on  information  and  the  di culty  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">for surgery a very imperfect one. It wil  be less imperfect in the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age.  A  patient  facing  the  need  for  an  operation  in  twenty-four  hours,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps even forty- ve minutes, could deputize digital assistants to locate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top ten surgeons worldwide available to perform such a task remotely, review</p>
<p class="calibre1">their success rates in similar cases, and solicit o ers for their particular case</p>
<p class="calibre1">from corresponding digital servants. Al  of this could be canvassed in a matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of moments. As a consequence, the most-favored 10 percent of surgeons wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a far larger share in the global market for surgery. The MRT machine, </p>
<p class="calibre1">plus  microsurgery  techniques,  wil   raise  the  premium  for  their  work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surgeons with less skil  wil  focus on residual local markets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  life-and-death  example  helps  suggest  some  of  the  revolutionary</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  of  the  liberation  of  economies  from  the  tyranny  of  place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone may object that General Electric’s MRT machine was not meant to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  employed  long-distance.  Perhaps,  but  this  misses  the  point.  It  or  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment  like  it  soon  wil   be.  When  operations  are  better  performed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgeons watching a screen than looking at the patient directly, it wil  matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">less  than  we  now  suppose  where  the  surgeon  and  his  screen  are  located. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Increasing numbers of services are destined to be recon gured to re ect the</p>

<p class="calibre1">right  by  the  wealthiest  industrial  countries  upon  their  citizens  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">preposterously uncompetitive on the new frontier of cyberspace. Soon after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the turn of the mil ennium, anyone who pays income taxes at rates currently</p>

<p class="calibre1">The cybereconomy provides just such an alternative. No government wil</p>

<p class="calibre1">Remember, each $5,000 of annual tax payments paid over forty years slashes</p>
<p class="calibre1">your net worth by $2.2 mil ion, assuming you could realize just a 10 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">return on your capital. At a 20 percent return, the compound loss bal oons to</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  $44  mil ion.  For  high-income  earners  in  a  high-tax  country,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cumulative losses from predatory taxation over a lifetime are staggering. Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  lose more than they ever had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  sounds  impossible,  but  the  mathematics  are  clear.  It  is  something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that you can con rm for yourself with a pocket calculator. The top 1 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">239</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-491"></a>of taxpayers in the United States pay an average of more than $125,000 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">federal income taxes annual y. For a fraction of that amount, $45,000 a year, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one would be welcome to live under a private tax treaty in Switzerland, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoy law and order provided by what is arguably the most honest police and</p>
<p class="calibre1">judicial system in the world. From this perspective, the additional $80,000 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">year of income tax paid above that generous level might wel  be classi ed as</p>
<p class="calibre1">tribute  or  plunder.  Forty- ve  thousand  dol ars  is  certainly  a  substantial</p>
<p class="calibre1">payment toward the maintenance of law and order, considering that police</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  is  meant  to  be  a  public  good.  In  theory,  public  goods  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">extended to additional users at a marginal cost of zero. The Swiss are glad to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have you pay a negotiated  xed tax of $45,000 (50,000 Swiss francs) per year</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they make an annual pro t of $45,000 on every mil ionaire who signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.Compared to the Swiss alternative, the lifetime losses from paying federal</p>
<p class="calibre1">income  tax  at  U.S.  rates  would  be  $705  mil ion  for  an  investor  who  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">average a 20 percent rate of return. But remember, that assumes an annual tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">payment  of  $45,000.  Compared  to  a  tax  haven  like  Bermuda,  where  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">income tax is zero, the lifetime loss for paying taxes at American rates would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be about $1.1 bil ion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You may object that an annual return of 20 percent is a high rate of return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No doubt you would be right. But given the startling growth in Asia in recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades,  many  investors  in  the  world  have  achieved  that  and  better.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">compound rate of return in Hong Kong real estate since 1950 has been more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than 20 percent per annum. Even some economies that are less widely known</p>
<p class="calibre1">for growth have a orded easy opportunities for high pro ts. You could have</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocketed  an  average  real  return  of  more  than  30  percent  annual y  in  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">dol ar  deposits  in  Paraguayan  banks  over  the  last  three  decades.  High</p>
<p class="calibre1">investment returns are easier to realize in some places than others, but skil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">investors can certainly achieve pro ts of 20 percent or more in good years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even if they do not consistently match the performances of George Soros or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Warren Bu et. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  the  higher  the  rate  of  return  that  you  could  earn  on  your</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital, the greater the opportunity costs that predatory income and capital</p>
<p class="calibre1">gains taxes impose. But the conclusion that the loss is huge, indeed greater</p>

<p class="calibre1">your net worth is reduced by more than $33 mil ion just by the income tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">you pay in excess of $45,000 annual y. Compared to a jurisdiction without</p>

<p class="calibre1">Enforcement of laws and particularly tax codes has become heavily dependent</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  surveil ance  of  communications  and  transactions.  Once  the  next  logical</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps  have  been  taken,  and  o shore  banking  locations  o er  the  services  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication  in  hard  RSA-encrypted  electronic  mail  using  account</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers derived from public-key systems,  nancial transactions wil  be almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible  to  monitor  at  the  bank  or  in  communications.  Even  if  the  tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities were to plant a mole in the o shore bank, or burglarize the bank</p>
<p class="calibre1">records, they would not be able to identify depositors<a href="#calibre_link-16">.12</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">To  a  degree  that  has  never  before  been  possible,  individuals  wil   be  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine where to domicile their economic activities and how much income</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  they  prefer  to  pay.  Many  transactions  in  the  Information  Age  wil   not</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to be domiciled in any territorial sovereignty at al . Those that do wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasingly  nd  their  way  to  places  like  Bermuda,  the  Cayman  Islands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uruguay, or similar jurisdictions that do not impose income taxes or other</p>
<p class="calibre1">costly transaction burdens on commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">From Monopoly to Competition</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments  have  become  accustomed  to  imposing  “protection  services” </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  are,  in  Frederic  C.  Lane’s  words,  “of  poor  quality  and  outrageously</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpriced. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”13</a> This habit of charging far more than government’s services are</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y  worth  developed  through  centuries  of  monopoly.  Taxes  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">ruthlessly raised on anyone who seemed capable of paying&mdash;precisely because</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments had a monopoly or near-monopoly on coercion. This tradition</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  monopoly  wil   clash  in  a  profound  way  with  the  new  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibilities of cybercommerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Encryption  wil   make  it  easy  to  protect  transactions  in  cyberspace.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost of an e ective encryption software program, like PGP, is less than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commission charged by a ful -service broker on a trade of one hundred shares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">242</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-172"></a>Yet  it  wil   render  almost  any  transaction  invisible  and  impervious  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments and thieves for many years to come. The new technology of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age  wil   e ectively  protect  cyberassets  at  a  vanishingly  smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost. For $55 rather than $55 mil ion, participants in the cybereconomy wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoy  better  actual  protection  of  their  assets  than  they  enjoyed  during  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  era  or  at  any  previous  time  in  history.  Easily  used  encryption</p>
<p class="calibre1">algorithms  and  the  capacity  to  shop  between  terrestrial  domiciles  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions  wil   provide  e ective  protection  against  the  largest  source  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">predation, nation-states themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  is  not  to  say  that  territorial  governments  wil   be  entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">outmaneuvered. They wil  stil  be able to exploit vulnerabilities to personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">harm in order to extract head taxes, or perhaps even hold wealthy individuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  outright  ransom.  They  wil   also  be  able  to  enforce  col ection  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consumption taxes. Yet protection, the most important service governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide, wil  be put on a more nearly competitive basis. Less of the cost that</p>
<p class="calibre1">productive  people  pay  for  protection  wil   be  available  to  be  seized  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">real ocated  by  political  authorities.  Technological  innovations  wil   place  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  and  growing  portion  of  the  world’s  wealth  outside  the  reach  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments.  This  wil   reduce  the  risks  of  trade,  sharply  lowering,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">historian  Janet  Abu-Lughod’s  words,  “the  proportion  of  al   costs”  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise would have had to be “al ocated to transit duties, tribute, or simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">extortion. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">It  has  been  rare  in  history  to  nd  governments  truly  constrained  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition.  In  the  few  times  when  something  remotely  like  this  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened,  governments  were  weak  and  technologies  were  similar  between</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions.  As  Lane  suggested,  the  principal  factor  a ecting  pro tability</p>
<p class="calibre1">under such conditions tends to be the di erence in protection costs paid by</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent entrepreneurs. The medieval merchant who had to pay twenty tol s</p>
<p class="calibre1">to bring his goods to market could not compete with a merchant who had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay  only  four  tol s  to  deliver  the  same  goods  to  the  customer.  Similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions are destined to return with the Information Age. Pro tability wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">once again be determined not so much by technological advantage as by your</p>
<p class="calibre1">success in minimizing the costs you are forced to pay for protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This new economic dynamic directly contradicts the desire of government</p>
<p class="calibre1">left  over  from  the  industrial  era  to  impose  monopoly  pricing  for  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">243</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-173"></a>protection services. But, like it or not, the old system wil  be nonviable in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new competitive environment of the Information Age. Any government that</p>
<p class="calibre1">insists upon lumbering its citizens with heavy taxes that competitors do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay  wil   merely  assure  that  pro ts  and  wealth  gravitate  someplace  else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  failure  of  the  mature  welfare  states  to  curtail  taxes  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">long term wil  be self-correcting. Governments that tax too much wil  simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">make residence anywhere within their power a bankrupting liability. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;FROM AN ENGLISH COURT DECISION, 1604</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE DEATH OF SEIGNIORAGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments wil  not only lose their power to tax many forms of income and</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital; they are also destined to lose their power of compulsion over money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the past, megapolitical transitions have been associated with changes in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">character of money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The introduction of coinage helped launch the  ve-hundred-year cycle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">expansion  in  the  ancient  economy  that  culminated  with  the  birth  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ and the lowest interest rates before the modern period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The advent of the Dark Ages coincided with virtual closure of the mints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Roman  coinage  continued  to  circulate,  quantities  of  money</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwindled along with trade in a self-reinforcing downward spiral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feudal revolution coincided with a reintroduction of money, coinage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bil s of exchange, and other devices for settling commercial transactions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, a surge in European silver production from new mines at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rammelsberg, Germany, facilitated an increase in the circulation of coin</p>
<p class="calibre1">that helped lubricate commerce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The greatest revolution in money prior to the Information Age came with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the advent of industrialism. The early-modern state consolidated its power</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Gunpowder Revolution. As its control increased, the state asserted</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  power  over  money,  and  came  to  rely  heavily  upon  the  signature</p>
<p class="calibre1">244</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-174"></a>technology  of  industrialism,  the  printing  press.  The  rst  implement  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass production, the printing press, has been widely used by governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the modern period to mass-produce paper money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paper  money  is  a  distinctly  industrial  product.  It  would  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">impractical before the printing press to duplicate receipts or certi cates that</p>
<p class="calibre1">became  paper  currency.  Certainly,  monks  in  the  scriptoria  would  not  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent  their  time  wel   drawing  fty-pound  notes.  Paper  money  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">contributed  signi cantly  to  the  power  of  the  state,  not  only  by  generating</p>
<p class="calibre1">pro ts from depreciating the currency, but by giving the state leverage over</p>
<p class="calibre1">who could accumulate wealth. As Abu-Lughod put it, “when paper money</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed by the state become the approved currency, the chances for amassing</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital  in  opposition  to  or  independent  of  the  state  machinery  became</p>
<p class="calibre1">di cult.” <a href="#calibre_link-16">16</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CYBERCASH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  the  advent  of  the  Information  Age  implies  another  revolution  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">character  of  money.  As  cybercommerce  begins,  it  wil   lead  inevitably  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybermoney.  This  new  form  of  money  wil   reset  the  odds,  reducing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity of the world’s nation-states to determine who becomes a Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individual. A crucial part of this change wil  come about because of the e ect</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  information  technology  in  liberating  the  holders  of  wealth  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">expropriation  through  in ation.  Soon,  you  wil   pay  for  almost  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction over the Net or World Wide Web at the same time you place it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">using cybercash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  new  digital  form  of  money  is  destined  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercommerce. It wil  consist of encrypted sequences of multihundred-digit</p>
<p class="calibre1">prime  numbers.  Unique,  anonymous,  and  veri able,  this  money  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodate the largest transactions. It wil  also be divisible into the tiniest</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraction  of  value.  It  wil   be  tradable  at  a  keystroke  in  a  multitril ion-dol ar</p>
<p class="calibre1">wholesale market without borders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Dialing Without Dollars</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">245</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-175"></a>Inevitably,  this  new  cybermoney  wil   be  denationalized.  When  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals can deal across borders in a realm with no physical reality, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   no  longer  need  to  tolerate  the  long-rehearsed  practice  of  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrading  the  value  of  their  money  through  in ation.  Why  should  they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Control  over  money  wil   migrate  from  the  hal s  of  power  to  the  global</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketplace. Any individual or  rm with access to cyberspace wil  be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily shift out of any currency that appears in danger of depreciation. Unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">today, there wil  be no necessity to deal in legal tender. Indeed, in transactions</p>
<p class="calibre1">spanning the globe it wil  be likely that at least one party to every transaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   nd himself dealing in a currency that is not legal tender to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Disadvantages of Barter Reduced</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">You wil  be able to trade in any medium you wish in the cybereconomy. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">the late Nobel Prize-winning economist F. A. Hayek argued, there is “no clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinction  between  money  and  non-money.”  He  wrote,  “although  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual y assume there is a sharp line of distinction between what is money and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is not&mdash;and the law general y tries to make such a distinction&mdash;so far as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  causal  e ects  of  monetary  events  are  concerned,  there  is  no  such  clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erence. What we  nd is rather a continuum in which objects of various</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrees of liquidity, or with values which can  uctuate independently of each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other,  shade  into  each  other  in  the  degree  to  which  they  function  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">money.” <a href="#calibre_link-16">17  </a>Digital  money  on  global  computer  networks  wil   make  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">object on Hayek’s continuum of liquidity more liquid&mdash;except government</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper. One consequence wil  be that barter wil  become far more practical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Increasing numbers of objects and services wil  be o ered in speci c bids for</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  objects  and  services.  These  potential  transactions  wil   be  widely</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertised  throughout  the  world  on  the  Net,  which  wil   increase  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">liquidity by magnitudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the principal drawbacks of barter has always been the di culty of</p>
<p class="calibre1">matching a person with one speci c demand with another who had exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  on  o er  and  was  seeking  to  acquire  for  himself  exactly  what  the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed to trade. Primitive barter stumbled over the daunting improbability</p>
<p class="calibre1">of exactly matching two parties wishing to exchange in a local market. Cash</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcended the limitations of barter, and its advantages wil  continue to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">246</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-395"></a>compel ing in most transactions. But vast increases in computational power</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the globalization of commerce in cyberspace also reduce the drawbacks of</p>
<p class="calibre1">barter. The odds of  nding someone with exactly reciprocal desires to yours</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  dramatical y  when  you  can  sort  instantly  across  the  entire  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than drawing on only those whom you might meet local y. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Not Subject to Counterfeiting</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">While paper money wil  no doubt remain in circulation as a residual medium</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  exchange  for  the  poor  and  computer-il iterate,  money  for  high-value</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions wil  be privatized. Cybermoney wil  no longer be denominated</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  in  national  units  like  the  paper  money  of  the  industrial  period.  It</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably  wil   be  de ned  in  terms  of  grams  or  ounces  of  gold,  as  nely</p>
<p class="calibre1">divisible as gold itself. Or it may be de ned in terms of other real stores of</p>
<p class="calibre1">value. Even where di erent pricing measures are used, or certain transactions</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue  to  be  denominated  in  national  currencies,  cybermoney  wil   serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  consumers  far  better  than  nationalized  money  ever  did.  Rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">advancing computational capacity wil  diminish the di culties of adjusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices to various media of exchange to the vanishing point. Each transaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   involve  the  transfer  of  encrypted  multihundred-digit  prime-number</p>
<p class="calibre1">sequences.  Unlike  the  paper-money  receipts  issued  by  governments  during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the gold-standard era, which could be duplicated at wil , the new digital gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">standard or its barter equivalents wil  be almost impossible to counterfeit for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fundamental mathematical reason that it is al  but impossible to unravel</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  product  of  multihundred-digit  prime  numbers.  Al   receipts  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">veri ably unique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  names  of  traditional  currencies  like  the  “pound”  and  the  “peso” </p>
<p class="calibre1">re ect  the  fact  that  they  originated  as  measures  of  weight  of  speci c</p>
<p class="calibre1">quantities  of  precious  metals.  The  pound  sterling  was  once  upon  a  time  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pound of sterling silver. Paper money in the West began as warehouse or safe-</p>
<p class="calibre1">deposit receipts for quantities of precious metals. Governments issuing these</p>
<p class="calibre1">receipts soon found that they could print far more of them than they could</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y redeem from their supply of bul ion. This was easy. No individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding a gold or silver certi cate could distinguish any information about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the actual supply of precious metals from his receipt. Other than the serial</p>
<p class="calibre1">247</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-176"></a>numbers, al  the receipts looked alike, a fact that appealed to counterfeiters as</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel  as politicians and bankers seeking to pro t from in ating the supply of</p>
<p class="calibre1">money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cybermoney wil  be al  but impossible to counterfeit in this way, o cial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  uno cial y.  The  veri ability  of  the  digital  receipts  rules  out  this  classic</p>
<p class="calibre1">expedient for expropriating wealth through in ation. The new digital money</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Information Age wil  return control over the medium of exchange to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  owners  of  wealth,  who  wish  to  preserve  it,  rather  than  to  nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wish to spirit it away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Transaction Cost of “Free” Currency</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Use of this new cybermoney wil  substantial y free you from the power of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state.  Earlier,  we  cited  the  dreary  record  of  the  world’s  nation-states  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintaining  the  value  of  their  currencies  over  the  past  half  century.  No</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency has su ered a smal er loss from in ation since World War II than the</p>
<p class="calibre1">German mark. Yet even so, 71 percent of its value vanished between January</p>
<p class="calibre1">1, 1949, and the end of June 1995. The world reserve currency during  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">period, the U.S. dol ar, lost 84 percent of its value<a href="#calibre_link-16">.18 </a>This is a measure of the wealth  that  governments  expropriated  by  exploiting  their  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolies on legal tender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Note that there is no intrinsic necessity that currency depreciate or that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nominal  cost  of  living  rise  every  year.  To  the  contrary.  The  technical</p>
<p class="calibre1">chal enge of maintaining the purchasing power of savings is trivial. You can</p>
<p class="calibre1">see  this  merely  by  looking  at  the  long-term  purchasing  power  of  gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between  January  1,  1949,  and  the  end  of  June  1995,  while  the  best  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalized currencies lost almost three-quarters of its value, the purchasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of gold actual y rose. As documented by Professor Roy W. Jastrom in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  book   <i class="calibre4">The  Golden  Constant, </i>  gold  has  maintained  its  purchasing  power, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with minor  uctuations, for as far back as reliable price records are available, </p>

<p class="calibre1">National currencies linked to gold have also maintained their purchasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">power when military exigencies were not pressing. The value of the British</p>
<p class="calibre1">pound sterling rose, rather than fel , during the relatively peaceful nineteenth</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;FRIEDRICH A. VON HAYEK</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Privatizing Money</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Friedrich  von  Hayek  argued  in  1976  that  the  use  of  competitive,  private</p>
<p class="calibre1">currencies  would  eradicate  in ation<a href="#calibre_link-16">.20</a>  Without  legal-tender  requirements</p>
<p class="calibre1">forcing  acceptance  of  an  in ating  currency  within  a  jurisdiction,  Hayek</p>
<p class="calibre1">argued,  market  competition  would  force  the  private  issuers  of  currency  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserve the value of their exchange media. Any issuer of a private currency</p>
<p class="calibre1">failing to maintain its value would soon lose its customers. The evolution of</p>
<p class="calibre1">encrypted cybercash wil  bring Hayek’s logic vividly to life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The theory of “free banking,” as it is cal ed, is not merely a hypothetical</p>
<p class="calibre1">academic  speculation.  Private  competing  currencies  circulated  in  Scotland</p>
<p class="calibre1">from early in the eighteenth century until 1844. During that period, Scotland</p>
<p class="calibre1">had no central bank. There were few regulations or restrictions on entry into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  banking  business.  Private  banks  took  deposits  and  issued  their  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">private currencies backed by gold bul ion. As Professor Lawrence White has</p>
<p class="calibre1">documented, this system worked wel . It was more stable, with less in ation</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the more heavily regulated and politicized system of banking and money</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  in  England  during  the  same  period<a href="#calibre_link-16">.21</a>  Michael  Prowse  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Financial Times</i> summarized Scotland’s free-banking experience: “There was</p>
<p class="calibre1">little  fraud.  There  was  no  evidence  of  over-issue  of  notes.  Banks  did  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">typical y hold either excessive or inadequate reserves. Bank runs were rare and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not  contagious.  The  free  banks  commanded  the  respect  of  citizens  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided  a  sound  foundation  for  economic  growth  that  outpaced  that  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">England for most of the period.” <a href="#calibre_link-16">22</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-326"></a>What worked wel  under the technological conditions of the eighteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  nineteenth  centuries  wil   work  even  better  with  twenty- rst-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology. You wil  soon be able to deal in digital money from a private  rm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">issued much as American Express issues traveler’s checks as receipts for cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  institution  of  greater  repute  than  any  government,  such  as  a  leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">mining  company  or  the  Swiss  Bank  Corporation,  could  create  encrypted</p>
<p class="calibre1">receipts for quantities of gold or even for unique bars, identi ed by molecular</p>
<p class="calibre1">signatures  and  possibly  even  inscribed  with  holograms.  These  receipts  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">then trade as money, with almost no possibility that they can be counterfeited</p>
<p class="calibre1">or in ated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new digital gold wil  overcome many of the practical problems that</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhibited  direct  use  of  gold  as  money  in  the  past.  It  wil   no  longer  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">inconvenient,  cumbersome,  or  dangerous  to  deal  in  large  sums  of  gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digital  receipts  wil   not  be  too  heavy  to  carry.  Indeed,  their  only  physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence  wil   be  as  elaborate  patterns  of  computer  code.  Nor  wil   it  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">di cult  to  divide  digital  receipts  into  units  smal   enough  to  pay  for  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">microvalue  purchases.  A  wafer  of  physical  gold  tiny  enough  to  pay  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiclet would soon be lost or confused with one tiny enough to pay for two</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiclets.  But  it  wil   be  as  easy  for  the  computer  to  distinguish  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">demoninations of digital money as if they were the size of a chipmunk and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhinoceros. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The capacity of digital money to deliver micropayments wil  facilitate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergence of new types of businesses that heretofore could not have existed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">specializing  in  organizing  the  distribution  of  low-value  information.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">vendors of this information wil  now be compensated through direct-debit</p>
<p class="calibre1">royalty schemes that overcome previously daunting transaction costs. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cost of bil ing exceeds the value of a transaction, it probably wil  not take</p>
<p class="calibre1">place.  Use  of  cybermoney  facilitates  very-low-cost  simultaneous  bil ing,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  accounts  are  debited  with  use.  We  cited  such  an  example  above  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagining that you might pay a royalty equivalent to one-third of a penny to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bil   Gates,  or  whoever  owns  the  virtual-reality  rights  to  tour  the  Louvre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Multiply this in a thousand ways. Virtual reality wil  create almost unlimited</p>
<p class="calibre1">licensing  opportunities  that  wil   nevertheless  command  only  microroyalty</p>
<p class="calibre1">payments.  One  day  you  wil   be  able  to  replay  the  third  game  of  the  1969</p>
<p class="calibre1">250</p>

<p class="calibre1">make your virtual reality seem real. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">ERADICATING INFLATION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Such possibilities notwithstanding, surely the most momentous consequence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the new digital money wil  be the end of in ation and the deleverage of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nancial  system.  The  economic  implications  are  profound.  The  rise  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">in ation in the twentieth century, as we argued in  <i class="calibre4">Blood in the Streets</i> and  <i class="calibre4">The</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Great Reckoning, </i> was intimately connected with the balance of power in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world.  Increasing  returns  to  violence  dictated  sharply  higher  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">expenditures,  which  in  turn  required  ever  more  aggressive  e orts  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expropriate wealth. Governments found that they could e ectively impose an</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual wealth tax on al  who held balances in their national currencies. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual wealth tax on currency holders could also be seen as a transaction fee</p>
<p class="calibre1">for al owing the users of currency to maintain their wealth in a convenient</p>
<p class="calibre1">form provided by the issuers<a href="#calibre_link-17">.I</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking of in ation as a transaction fee for the convenience of holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency may be unusual, but consider it closely. During the Industrial Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">we became so accustomed to thinking of the provision of currency as a service</p>
<p class="calibre1">for which one does not pay directly, that it was easy to forget that the issuers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the dol ars, pesos, pounds, and francs, namely governments, did require</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we pay, and pay dearly&mdash;through in ation. The rate of this in ationary</p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction fee on currency varied during the last half century from a low of</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.7 percent annual y for the German mark, to rates perilously close to 100</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent.  For  example,  between  1960  and  1991,  when  President  Menem</p>
<p class="calibre1">launched Argentina’s currency-board reform, in ation struck seventeen zeros</p>
<p class="calibre1">o  successive versions of Argentine currency. If al  the wealth of the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been converted into Argentine pesos in 1960 and buried, it would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been worth the e ort to spade it up by 1991. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Argentina’s  example  is  a  leading  indicator  for  the  next  mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Currency wil  not be in ated because other nation-states wil  no longer be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to get away with it just as Argentina no longer can. The di erence wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">that private money dispersed over the Net wil  be even less susceptible to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">reversal in policy than Argentina’s automatic currency-board system, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">251</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-492"></a>could  be  damaged  by  a  credit  contraction  imported  from  other  countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Private money wil  not be in atable because of competitive market pressures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The death of in ation wil  take away the disguised pro ts that in ation</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously conveyed to those who were the monopolistic issuers of currency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If al  the disguised pro ts of issuing money were extinguished, a new method</p>
<p class="calibre1">of payment would be needed to compensate the issuers of currency directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Use  of  the  new  monetary  system  wil   therefore  probably  involve  a  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">explicit transaction cost, perhaps a fee on the order of 1 percent per annum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This wil  be a smal  price to pay compared to the annual in ationary penalty</p>
<p class="calibre1">of from 2.7 percent to 99 percent imposed by nation-states. Al  the more so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because there is a likelihood that overal  prices wil  decline in the future as</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolies are eroded and competition intensi es worldwide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Contracting Leverage</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The emergence of digital money wil  not only defeat in ation once and for</p>
<p class="calibre1">al ;  it  wil   also  contract  leverage  in  the  banking  systems  of  the  world.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability of people everywhere to bypass regulatory authorities and shift their</p>
<p class="calibre1">funds directly through the Internet is an entirely unprecedented consequence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  globalization  of  markets.  It  wil   be  beyond  the  power  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  to  regulate.  When  governments  can  no  longer  depreciate</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency  by  printing  money  or  defraud  savers  by  expanding  credit  at  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">through captive banking systems, they wil  lose a major part of their indirect</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity to commandeer resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Higher Interest Rates</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  wil   create  an  obvious  dilemma  for  most  Western  governments.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  face sharp drops in revenue from taxation and the virtual elimination of</p>
<p class="calibre1">leverage  in  the  monetary  system.  At  the  same  time,  they  wil   retain  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfunded  liabilities  and  in ated  expectations  for  social  spending  inherited</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  industrial  era.  The  result  to  be  expected  is  an  intense  scal  crisis</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  many  unpleasant  social  side  e ects  that  we  wil   consider  in  later</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapters.  The  economic  consequence  of  this  transition  crisis  wil   probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">include  a  one-time  spike  in  real  interest  rates.  Debtors  wil   be  squeezed  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">252</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-344"></a>long-term  liabilities  contracted  under  the  old  system  are  liquidated,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">concessionary credits dry up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Altered by Competition</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments  facing  serious  competition  to  their  currency  monopolies  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably seek to underprice the for-fee cybercurrencies by tightening credits</p>
<p class="calibre1">and o ering savers higher real yields on cash balances in national currencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some governments may even seek to remonetize gold as another expedient to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet competition from private currencies. They may wel  reason that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  gain  higher  seigniorage  pro ts  from  a  loosely  control ed  nineteenth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century gold standard than would be the case if they al owed their national</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency  to  be  displaced  entirely  by  commercial  cybermoney.  But  not  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments wil  respond in the same way. Those in regions where computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">usage and Net participation are low may opt for old-fashioned hyperin ation</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  early  stages  of  the  cybereconomy.  This  wil   not  enable  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  to  capture  the  cash  balances  of  the  rich,  but  it  wil   wring</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  from  those  with  little  wealth  or  access  to  the  cybereconomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments using such tactics might nonetheless borrow international y in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybermoney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stil   other  governments  may  adapt  to  the  opportunities  created  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information economy, and facilitate local transactions in cybermoney. Those</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions that  rst recognize the validity of digital signatures and provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">local court enforcement of repossession for nonpayment of cyberdebts wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand to bene t from a disproportionate surge in long-term capital lending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  no  cybermoney  would  be  available  for  long-term  credits  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">territories  where  local  courts  imposed  penalties  or  permitted  debtors  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">default without recourse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Yield Gap</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  combination  of  credit  crises,  competitive  adjustments  by  national</p>
<p class="calibre1">monetary  authorities,  and  early  transitional  obstacles  to  lending</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercurrency wil  lead to a yield gap in the early stages of the information</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy. Cybermoney wil  pay lower interest rates than national currencies</p>
<p class="calibre1">253</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-409"></a>and  wil   probably  also  carry  explicit  transaction  costs.  O setting  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparent  drawbacks  to  holding  balances  in  digital  money  wil   be  enhanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection against losses due to predatory taxes and in ation. Because it wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably be gold-linked, cybermoney wil  also bene t from the appreciation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  gold.  The  price  of  gold  wil   probably  rise  signi cantly  relative  to  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">commodities,  no  matter  which  of  the  alternative  government  policies</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The real price of gold almost always rises in de ation. A de ation, after al , </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Deflation of the Industrial Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Higher real rates al  around wil  spur liquidation of high-cost, unproductive</p>

<p class="calibre1">consequences  in  the  high-cost  industrial  economies  of  North  America  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Western Europe than in the low-cost economies in Asia and Latin America. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Lower Rates Long-Term</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  early  consequences  of  the  emergence  of  the  cybereconomy  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely  to  include  higher  interest  rates,  the  longer-term  consequence  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  the  opposite.  The  after-tax  returns  to  savers  wil   sharply  increase  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  escape  the  grasp  of  governments.  Dramatic  improvements  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ciency  of  resource  use,  and  the  liberation  of  capital  to  nd  the  highest</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns global y, should rapidly compensate for the output lost early in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transition crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Investor Control over Capital</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Conventional thinkers reviewing our argument at this point would conclude</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  breakdown  of  income  redistribution  in  the  leading  nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">254</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-178"></a>would doom the world to economic col apse. Do not believe it. We do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">gainsay the fact that a transition crisis would be likely. But the view that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state  improves  the  functioning  of  the  economy  by  massive  real ocation  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  is  an  anachronism,  an  article  of  faith  roughly  equivalent  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">widespread  superstitions  at  the  close  of  the  Middle  Ages  that  fasting  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">agel ation were bene cial for a community. It should not be forgotten that</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments waste resources on a large scale. Wasting resources makes you</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor.  A  dramatic  improvement  in  the  e ciency  of  resource  use  wil   arise</p>
<p class="calibre1">when revenues historical y engrossed by governments come to be control ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead by persons of genuine talent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tens  of  bil ions,  then  ultimately  hundreds  of  bil ions  of  dol ars  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed by hundreds of thousands, then mil ions of Sovereign Individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These new stewards of the world’s wealth are likely to prove far abler than</p>
<p class="calibre1">politicians in utilizing resources and deploying investment. For the  rst time</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  history,  megapolitical  conditions  wil   al ow  the  ablest  investors  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs rather than specialists in violence ultimate control over capital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  the  rates  of  return  on  this  dispersed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">market-driven investment could be double or triple the meager returns from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  political y  driven  budget  al ocations  of  the  nation-state  era.  It  was  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncommon in the  nal decades of the twentieth century to  nd examples in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any country of government investment that were substantial y negative. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">cited o cial Russian statistics in the revised version of  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">from  November  1992,  suggesting  that  the  whole  of  Russia’s  economy  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“worth  just  $30  bil ion,  less  than  a  third  of  the  value  of  its  raw-material</p>
<p class="calibre1">inputs.  By  implication,  the  output  of  Russia’s  economy  would  more  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">triple in value if the domestic manufacturing and service economy were shut</p>
<p class="calibre1">down completely. Instead of contributing value, they subtract it. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”23</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, the example of Russia after the col apse of Communism is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme  one,  but  there  is  ample  evidence  that  reducing  state  control  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  tends  to  improve  economic  e ciency.  Growth  rates  cited  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Economist</i> suggest that economic liberty is strongly correlated with economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth,  with  the  most  rapid  rates  of  growth  in  the  freest  countries.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy  of  the  Information  Age  wil   be  more  free  than  any  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  realm  in  history.  It  is  therefore  reasonable  to  expect  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy wil  rapidly become the most important new economy of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">255</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-179"></a>new mil ennium. Its success wil  attract new participants from everywhere on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  globe,  in  the  same  way  that  the  wide  use  of  fax  machines  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">telecopying  increasingly  attractive  for  nonusers.  But  even  more  important, </p>
<p class="calibre1">freedom from predatory violence wil  al ow the cybereconomy to grow at far</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher compound rates of growth than conventional economies dominated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is perhaps the most important point to be made in anticipating the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  impact  of  the  likely  col apse  of  monopoly  taxing  and  in ating</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacities of government. Setting aside transition di culties, which could last</p>
<p class="calibre1">for decades, the long-term prospects for the global economy should be highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">bul ish. Whenever circumstances al ow people to reduce protection costs and</p>
<p class="calibre1">minimize tribute paid to those who control organized violence, the economy</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual y  grows  dramatical y.  As  Lane  said,  “I  would  like  to  suggest  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most weighty single factor in most periods of growth, if any one factor has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been  most  important,  has  been  a  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">devoted to war and police.” <a href="#calibre_link-16">24</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There  could  be  great  e ciency  gains  arising  from  a  reduction  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources devoted to predation and living o  the spoils of predation. If the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pricing  of  protection  were  placed  on  a  competitive  basis,  with  local</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolies  competing  for  customers  on  a  basis  of  price  and  quality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">potential y  huge  gains  to  e ciency  would  be  possible.  The  result  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected would be much lower rates of taxation and less loss of resources and</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ort  in  political  activity,  which  would  no  longer  pay  its  previously  huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">dividends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would  voters  wil ingly  forgo  political  windfal s  to  which  they  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">become accustomed? That is an issue we take up at length elsewhere. But a</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple  answer  is  that  we  may  have  no  choice.  No  one  now  demonstrates</p>
<p class="calibre1">against  rainy  weather,  or  draught,  however  economical y  damaging  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasant it may be. No one, however criminal y inclined, holds a pauper to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ransom  demanding  a  huge  payment  on  pain  of  death.  If  it  becomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible for politicians to obtain resources to redistribute, the public may</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond in a rational way and forget about politics, just as wel -intentioned</p>

<p class="calibre1">resources  wil   be  sharply  diminished,  a  new  con guration  of  wealth  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop,  without  the  coercive  mediation  by  government  that  characterized</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  twentieth  century.  Because  location  wil   mean  much  less  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Society,  there  wil   be  a  diminished  role  in  the  future  for  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations that operate within rather than beyond geographic boundaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Politicians,  labor  unions,  regulated  professions,  lobbyists,  and  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">per se</i>  wil   be  less  important.  Because  favors  and  restraints  of  trade  wrested</p>
<p class="calibre1">from governments wil  be less valuable, fewer resources wil  be wasted either</p>
<p class="calibre1">to promote or resist lobbying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who have employed compulsion and local advantage to redistribute</p>
<p class="calibre1">income are destined to lose much of their power. This wil  alter the command</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  resources.  Privately  generated  wealth  that  heretofore  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">commandeered by the nation-state wil  be retained instead by those who earn</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.  Increasing  amounts  of  wealth  wil   nd  their  way  into  the  hands  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">258</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-180"></a>ablest entrepreneurs and venture capitalists worldwide. Globalization, along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with other characteristics of the information economy, wil  tend to increase</p>
<p class="calibre1">the income earned by the most talented individuals in each  eld. Because the</p>
<p class="calibre1">marginal  value  generated  by  superlative  performance  wil   be  so  huge,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution of earnings capacity throughout the entire global economy wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">take much the shape it does now in the performance professions like athletics</p>
<p class="calibre1">and opera. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A MAGNITUDE BEYOND PARETO’S LAW</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pareto’s law says that 80 percent of the bene t wil  depend on or go to 20</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent  of  those  engaged.  This  may  be  approximately  true,  though,  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">strikingly, 1 percent of the population of the United States pays 28.7 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the income tax, suggesting that as societies advance into the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age they wil  experience an even more skewed distribution of incomes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">abilities than Vilfredo Pareto observed at the end of the last century. People</p>
<p class="calibre1">are quite accustomed to substantial inequalities of wealth. In 1828, 4 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  New  Yorkers  were  thought  to  have  owned  62  percent  of  al   the  city’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth. By 1845, the top 4 percent owned about 81 percent of al  corporate</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  noncorporate  wealth  in  New  York  City.  More  broadly,  the  top  10</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the population owned about 40 percent of the wealth across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  United  States  in  1860.  By  1890,  records  suggest  that  the  richest  12</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent then owned about 86 percent of America’s wealth<a href="#calibre_link-16">.1</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The 1890 numbers are close to what Pareto had in mind. They vary from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  ratio  of  80-20  percent  mainly  because  a  huge  in ux  of  penniless</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants  arrived  in  America  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants’  share  of  total  wealth  was  negligible;  therefore,  their  arrival</p>
<p class="calibre1">automatical y made the total holdings of wealth more unequal. In fact, this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a striking il ustration of the fact that any genuine upsurge in opportunity is</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost inevitably bound to lead to at least a brief surge in inequality. By 1890, </p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants accounted for about 15 percent of the total U.S. population, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than 40 percent in some of the northeastern states, where much of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">income and wealth were generated. <a href="#calibre_link-16">2 </a>Adjusting for the surge in immigration, </p>
<p class="calibre1">late-nineteenth-century  America  t  Pareto’s  formula  about  as  wel   as  late-</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-181"></a>The  Information  Age  has  already  changed  the  distribution  of  wealth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly in the United States, and is one of the reasons for the bitterness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern American politics, which we explore further in the next chapter. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age requires a quite high standard of literacy and numeracy for</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  success.  A  massive  U.S.  Education  Department  survey,  “Adult</p>
<p class="calibre1">Literacy in America,” has shown that as many as 90 mil ion Americans over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  age  of  fteen  are  woeful y  incompetent.  Or  in  the  more  colorful</p>
<p class="calibre1">characterization of American expatriate Bil  Bryson, “They are as stupid as</p>
<p class="calibre1">pig dribble. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”3</a> Speci cal y, 90 mil ion American adults were judged incapable</p>
<p class="calibre1">of writing a letter, fathoming a bus schedule, or adding and subtracting, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the help of a calculator. Those who cannot make sense of an ordinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">bus  timetable  are  unlikely  to  be  able  to  make  much  of  the  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Superhighway.  From  this  third  of  Americans  who  have  not  prepared</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves to join the electronic information world, an angry underclass is</p>
<p class="calibre1">being recruited. At the top of society is a smal  group, perhaps 5 percent, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly  educated  information  workers  or  capital  owners  who  are  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age equivalent of the landed aristocracy of the feudal age&mdash;with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the crucial di erence that the elite of the Information Age are specialists in</p>
<p class="calibre1">production, not specialists in violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Megapolitics of Innovation</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For no very good reason, most twentieth-century sociologists have assumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  technological  progress  would  natural y  tend  to  produce  increasingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">egalitarian societies. This was not true prior to about 1750. Beginning around</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  time,  innovative  new  industrial  technology  began  to  open  job</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities for the unskil ed and increase the scale of enterprise. The new</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  of  the  factory  not  only  raised  the  real  earnings  of  the  poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">without  any  e ort  on  their  part;  it  also  tended  to  increase  the  power  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  systems,  making  them  more  able  to  redistribute  income  as  wel   as</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  capable  of  withstanding  unrest.  Taking  a  longer  view,  there  is  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherent reason to suppose that technology always tends to mask rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">accentuate  the  di erences  in  human  talents  and  motivation.  Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">technologies have been relatively egalitarian, requiring contributions of many</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent workers of approximately equal utility; others have put power</p>
<p class="calibre1">260</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-182"></a>or wealth into the hands of a few masters while most people were little more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  serfs.  Both  history  and  technology  have  shaped  di erent  nations  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent ways. The Factory Age produced one shape, and the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age  is  producing  another,  less  violent,  and  therefore  more  elitist  and  less</p>
<p class="calibre1">egalitarian than the one it is replacing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AMMON’S TURNIP</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  late  nineteenth  century  a  number  of  economists,  of  whom  Wil iam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanley  Jevons  was  the  most  distinguished  in  England,  started  to  develop</p>
<p class="calibre1">mathematical  economics.  One  of  the  rst  to  apply  probability  theory  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">major social question was the German economist Otto Ammon, whose work</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  rst  translated  into  English  by  Carlos  C.  Closson  in  an  article  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Journal of Political Economy</i> in 1899. The article was entitled “Some Social</p>
<p class="calibre1">Applications of the Doctrine of Probability. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”4</a> One might suppose that such</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  article  was  now  of  purely  antiquarian  interest.  In  fact,  it  deals  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic problem that is again coming to the fore, and deals with it in what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is stil  a stimulating way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto Ammon was interested in the distribution of ability in society, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  relationship  to  the  distribution  of  income  and  status.  He  took  as  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting  point  the  probable  occurrence  of  total  scores  from  four  dice,  each</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  six  sides.  Out  of  1,296  possible  throws,  some  totals  wil   occur  much</p>

<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is immediately apparent that high and low scores are both comparatively</p>
<p class="calibre1">rare. There are two possible totals, but the top four of these only occur thirty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ve times out of the 1,296, and the bottom four only occur thirty- ve times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The middle seven group of scores can be expected to occur 884 times; the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle  third  of  possible  scores  is  the  result  in  more  than  two-thirds  of  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">throws.  This  produces  the  characteristic  crowding  toward  the  center  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">probability theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto Ammon argued that this random distribution of throws of the dice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was matched by the distribution of human abilities. He was writing before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  development  of  intel igence  testing  and  IQs,  and  relied  on  the  earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1">work on intel igence of Francis Galton. Ammon did not consider that social</p>
<p class="calibre1">utility,  or  success  in  life,  depended  simply  on  intel igence.  He  listed  “three</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups of mental traits which are largely decisive in the place which a man</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  occupy in life.” These were:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.  <i class="calibre4">Intellectual traits; </i> among which I included al  that belong to the rational side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of man-power of quick comprehension, memory, power, of judgement, power</p>
<p class="calibre1">of invention, and whatever also belongs to this  eld. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.  <i class="calibre4">Moral  traits; </i>  namely,  self  control,  wil   power,  industry,  perseverance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">moderation, regard for family obligations, honesty and the like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  <i class="calibre4">Economic  traits; </i>  such  as  business  ability,  organizing  talent,  technical  skil , </p>
<p class="calibre1">caution, clever calculation, foresight, thrift and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To these mental traits he added:</p>
<p class="calibre1">4.  <i class="calibre4">Bodily traits; </i> power to work, endurance, power of undergoing exertions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of resisting excitements of every kind, vigour, good, health, etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">262</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-183"></a>In  Otto  Ammon’s  view,  the  probable  distribution  of  these  qualities  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">intel igence, character, talent, and body were similar to those of scores on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dice. He went further and argued that there were, in fact, many more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">four  variables,  and  that  they  varied  in  more  than  six  degrees.  If  instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">throwing four dice, one throws eight, then there are no less than 1,679,616</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible throws, yet the highest score, forty-eight, can stil  only be expected to</p>
<p class="calibre1">occur once. The man or woman who scores very highly in al  the factors that</p>
<p class="calibre1">determine the place in life is much rarer than the probability of throwing four</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixes  would  suggest;  perhaps  as  rare  as  throwing  eight  sixes.  Yet,  Ammon</p>
<p class="calibre1">notes, a mixture of high and low scores in these human qualities may produce</p>
<p class="calibre1">“persons of unbalanced, inharmonious gifts, who, in spite of some bril iant</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualities, cannot successful y meet the tests of life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Like a lonely mountain peak, or rather, like the spire of a cathedral, rise the men</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">of high talent and of genius above the broad mass of mediocrity</i>.… <i class="calibre4">The number of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the highly gifted is at all events so small that it is impossible that ‘many</i>’  <i class="calibre4">such can</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;OTTO AMMON</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Traits and Incomes</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ammon then turns to the distribution of incomes. Of course, the statistics of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  1890s  were  much  less  adequate  than  they  would  be  now,  but  German</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucracy was already wel  developed, and Otto Ammon found in Saxony, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prussia, Baden, and other German states income curves that he thought were</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar,  both  to  his  perceived  distribution  of  human  ability  and  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">probabilities of the dice. He found similar  gures in Charles Booth’s  <i class="calibre4">Life and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Labour  of  the  People  of  London</i>  (1892).  Indeed,  Booth’s  social  distribution</p>
<p class="calibre1">does  look  much  as  one  might  expect  from  Ammon’s  probability  theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Booth found in London 25 percent who were poor or worse, 51.5 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">who were comfortable, and 15 percent who were wel -to-do, or better; if one</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes the two lowest of Booth’s categories they come to 9.5 percent. It was</p>
<p class="calibre1">common before the welfare states of the twentieth century to speak of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  were  least  wel   o   as  the  “submerged  tenth. <a href="#calibre_link-16">”5  </a>The  two  highest  of Booth’s categories come to 7 percent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">263</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-184"></a>From al  this, Otto Ammon drew a number of interesting conclusions. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  that  people’s  abilities,  broadly  de ned,  determined  their  place  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">society  and  their  income.  He  believed  that  high  abilities  natural y  result  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">people rising in income and social position. “Like a lonely mountain peak, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather, like the spire of a cathedral, rise the men of high talent and of genius</p>
<p class="calibre1">above the broad mass of mediocrity,…” He also believed that the “true form</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the so-cal ed social pyramid is that of a somewhat  at onion or turnip.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This turnip has a narrow stem above and a narrow root beneath. Such a social</p>
<p class="calibre1">turnip is preferable as a metaphor to the social pyramid because, like modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial society, it has its mass in the middle while the pyramid has its mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Shape of the Turnip</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Modern industrial societies are indeed al  turnips, with a smal  wealthy and</p>
<p class="calibre1">upper-professional class at the top, a larger middle class, and a minority poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">class at the bottom. Relative to the middle, both the extremes are smal . In</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern London, if not in Washington, there are certainly more mil ionaires</p>
<p class="calibre1">than homeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al  of this is intriguing, but the immediate interest of Ammon’s work lies</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the major long-term shift we are experiencing in the relations,  nancial and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political, between the top and the middle. The skil s needed in the Factory</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age, which is now passing, are undeniably di erent from those demanded by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Information  Age.  Most  people  could  master  the  skil s  required  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">operating  the  machines  of  the  mid-twentieth  century,  but  those  jobs  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">now been replaced by smart machines which, in e ect, control themselves. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole arena of low- and middle-skil  employment has already disappeared. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">we are correct, this is a prelude to the disappearance of most employment and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the recon guration of work in the spot market. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Yet it is a fact, acknowledged officially but quietly, that most of the unemployed</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">was  set  as  the  ful -employment  standard  of  the  1940s  and  1950s.  Suppose</p>
<p class="calibre1">that in the Information Age the required score has risen to a 4 X 3, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">required minimum has gone up from 8 to 12. That would mean that nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">24 percent would fal  below this limit of “social usefulness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something  similiar  would  happen  at  the  top  end  of  the  scale.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Factory Age, the required level of high ability was perhaps 4 X 4; suppose that</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Information Age it has risen to 4 X 5. In that case the proportion of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people quali ed for the top jobs, which are also the best paid, would fal  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">34 percent to 5 percent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These numbers are purely hypothetical. Obviously, we do not know what</p>
<p class="calibre1">the shift in the skil  requirements wil  be&mdash;or has already been&mdash;but there has</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly been a rise. Because of the shape of the turnip, a quite modest rise in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  minimum  skil   requirement  would  put  large  numbers  outside  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">signi cant  economic  role.  Equal y,  quite  a  smal   rise  in  the  higher  skil</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirement would reduce the number of people quali ed for the higher jobs</p>
<p class="calibre1">very dramatical y. Some shift is happening: we do not yet know how big it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  indeed  no  lack  of  social  and  political  evidence  that  this  shift  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking place in al  advanced industrial societies, that its pace is accelerating, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and that the movement is already a big one. The rewards for rare skil s have</p>
<p class="calibre1">increased  and  are  increasing.  This  has  been  noted  with  displeasure  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventional thinkers. Consider, for example,  <i class="calibre4">The Winner-Take-All Society</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by Robert H. Frank and Philip J. Cook<a href="#calibre_link-19">.7</a> It documents the growing tendency</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the most talented competitors in many  elds in the United States to earn</p>
<p class="calibre1">very high incomes. Equal y, the opportunities for middle skil s are fal ing; a</p>
<p class="calibre1">substantial, number of low skil s now fal  outside the range that is rewarded</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  a  comfortable  living,  though  they  may  stil   nd  a  place  in  smal -scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">services. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the Information Age demands higher skil s both at the top and bottom</p>
<p class="calibre1">end, everyone except for the top 5 percent wil  be relatively at a disadvantage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but the top 5 percent wil  gain tremendously. They wil  both earn a higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">265</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-431"></a>share of income and keep a greater share of what they earn. At the same time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they wil  do a greater portion of the world’s work than ever before. Many wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerge  as  Sovereign  Individuals.  In  the  Information  Age,  the  turnip  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">income distribution wil  look more as it did in 1750 than in 1950. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Societies that have been indoctrinated to expect income equality and high</p>
<p class="calibre1">levels  of  consumption  for  persons  of  low  or  modest  skil s  wil   face</p>
<p class="calibre1">demotivation  and  insecurity.  As  the  economies  of  more  countries  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeply  assimilate  information  technology,  they  wil   see  the  emergence&mdash;so</p>
<p class="calibre1">evident  already  in  North  America&mdash;of  a  more  or  less  unemployable</p>
<p class="calibre1">underclass. This is exactly what is happening. This wil  lead to a reaction with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a nationalist, antitechnology bias, as we detail in the next chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Factory  Age  may  prove  to  have  been  a  unique  period  in  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">semistupid machines left a highly pro table niche for unskil ed people. Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the machines can look after themselves, the Information Age is pouring</p>
<p class="calibre1">its gifts onto the top 5 percent of Otto Ammon’s turnip. The Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age  was  already  looking  far  better  for  the  top  10  percent,  the  so-cal ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive elite. Yet it wil  be the best of al  for the top 10 percent of the top 10</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent,  the  cognitive  double  top.  In  the  feudal  age,  it  took  one  hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">semiskil ed  peasants  to  support  one  highly  skil ed  warlord  (or  knight)  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">horseback. The Sovereign Individuals of the information economy wil  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">be warlords but masters of specialized skil s, including entrepreneurship and</p>
<p class="calibre1">investment.  Yet  the  feudal  hundred-to-one  ratio  seems  set  to  return.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1">better or worse, the societies of the twenty- rst century are likely to be more</p>

<p class="calibre1">267</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-187"></a>adverse e ects on “fairness” arising from the death of politics. It is certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">true  that  the  advent  of  the  global  information  economy  wil   deal  a  mortal</p>
<p class="calibre1">blow to large-scale income redistribution. The main bene ciaries of income</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution  in  the  Industrial  Age  have  been  inhabitants  of  wealthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions  whose  level  of  consumption  is  twenty  times  higher  than  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world average. Only within the OECD countries has income redistribution</p>
<p class="calibre1">had noticeable e ects in raising incomes of unskil ed persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The greatest income inequalities have been observed  <i class="calibre4">among</i> jurisdictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Income redistribution has done little to al eviate them. In fact, we believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign  aid  and  international  development  programs  have  had  the  perverse</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ect  of  lowering  the  real  incomes  of  poor  people  in  poor  countries  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidizing incompetent governments. This is an issue we consider in more</p>
<p class="calibre1">depth in analyzing the impact of the Information Revolution on morality. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">A Century of Rising Income Inequality</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the industrial period, the factor that contributed most to determining</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ordinary person’s lifetime income was the political jurisdiction in which</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  happened  to  reside.  Contrary  to  the  common  impression  in  rich</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies today, income inequality rose rapidly during the industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An estimate cited by the World Bank suggests that average per capita income</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  richest  countries  bal ooned  from  eleven  times  that  in  the  poorest</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  in  1870  to  fty-two  times  in  1985<a href="#calibre_link-19">.9</a>  While  inequality  increased dramatical y on a global basis, it often appeared otherwise to the fraction of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world inhabiting the wealthy industrial countries. Income inequality rose</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">among</i> jurisdictions rather than within them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  have  already  explored,  the  character  of  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  itself  helped  assure  that  income  gaps  would  narrow  within</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions where halfway competent governments mastered the exercise of</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  on  a  large  scale.  When  returns  to  violence  were  rising,  as  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the Industrial Age, governments that operated on a large scale tended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  control ed  by  their  employees.  This  made  it  e ectively  impossible  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">impose controls on the claims these governments made over resources. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchecked control over resources conveyed an important military advantage</p>
<p class="calibre1">so long as magnitude of power predominated over the e ciency with which</p>
<p class="calibre1">268</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-188"></a>it  was  used.  A  not-incidental  corol ary  of  government  control ed  by  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees  was  a  sharp  acceleration  of  income  redistribution.  Almost  every</p>
<p class="calibre1">society has some provision for income redistribution, at least on a temporary</p>
<p class="calibre1">basis in extraordinary circumstances. However, a close reading of the history</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the provision of aid to the poor shows that “welfare” bene ts tend to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">more generous when poverty is minimal. Income redistribution is more likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be curtailed when incomes for large numbers weaken. Conditions in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy  industrial  societies  in  the  last  half  of  the  twentieth  century  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost perfect for redistributing income. This led to much higher rewards for</p>
<p class="calibre1">unskil ed  work  within  these  favored  jurisdictions.  In  due  course,  it  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided high levels of consumption for those who did not work at al . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Paradox of Industrial Wealth</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The irony is that it was also in these jurisdictions that more people became</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy. This apparent paradox makes perfect sense once you understand the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dynamics of megapolitics explored in previous chapters. Leading sectors of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the industrial economy required the maintenance of order on a large scale to</p>
<p class="calibre1">function optimal y. This made them particularly vulnerable to extortion by</p>
<p class="calibre1">unions  and  governments  eager  to  maximize  the  number  of  persons  under</p>
<p class="calibre1">their sway. Yet widespread redistribution of income did not total y sti e the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability  of  the  industrial  economy  to  function.  Anyone  lucky  enough  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">born  in  Western  Europe,  the  former  British  settlement  colonies,  or  Japan</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the high-water period of industrialism was therefore likely to be far</p>
<p class="calibre1">richer than a person of equivalent skil s in South America, Eastern Europe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the late Soviet Union, Africa, and the landmass of Asia. The bene cial impact</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  information  technology  wil   include  helping  to  overcome  many  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstacles  to  development  that  prevented  the  majority  of  the  world’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">As Mancur Olson has demonstrated, backwardness in the twentieth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">was not due to lack of capital or specialized skil s  <i class="calibre4">per se. </i> In “Diseconomies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scale and Development,” an essay published in 1987, two years before the fal</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Berlin Wal , Olson wrote, “If capital had in fact been in scarce supply</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the poor countries, its ‘marginal productivity’ and so the pro tability of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">use  ought  to  be  greater  than  in  the  prosperous  countries.  The  low  growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">rates of many countries that received nonnegligible amounts of foreign aid</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the low productivity of some modern factories that were built in poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  have  further  lessened  the  credibility  of  the  ‘scarcity  of  capital’</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation of underdevelopment. <a href="#calibre_link-19">”11</a> This must be right. Had capital or skil</p>
<p class="calibre1">scarcity  been  the  main  de ciency,  the  returns  earned  by  both  in  poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions  would  have  been  higher  than  in  developed  countries.  Both</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil ed personnel and capital would have  ooded into these regions until the</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns  leveled  out.  In  fact,  the  opposite  was  often  the  case.  There  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">substantial  outmigration  of  educated  people  from  backward  jurisdictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  lucky  few  who  did  manage  to  accumulate  capital  in  such  places</p>
<p class="calibre1">exported it as rapidly as possible to Switzerland and other advanced countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Better Government Could Not Be Imported</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Olson  argues,  and  we  agree,  that  the  true  obstacle  to  development  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward countries has been the one factor of production that could not be</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily  borrowed  or  imported  from  abroad,  namely  government.  This  is  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem  that  worsened  as  the  twentieth  century  unfolded.  In  1900,  Great</p>
<p class="calibre1">Britain and France, along with some other European countries, were in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  of  exporting  competent  government  to  regions  where  indigenous</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers were incapable of functioning e ectively on a large scale. But shifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  conditions  in  the  twentieth  century  raised  the  costs  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowered the returns for this activity. Colonialism, or imperialism, as it was less</p>
<p class="calibre1">fondly known, ceased to be a paying proposition. Shifts in technology raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">the costs of projecting power from the center to the periphery and lowered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  military  costs  of  an  e ective  resistance.  Consequently,  imperial  powers</p>
<p class="calibre1">270</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-190"></a>withdrew, or stayed on only in tiny enclaves, like Bermuda or the Cayman</p>

<p class="calibre1">The indigenous governments that replaced colonial rule in the countries</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  were  not  settled  by  Europeans  drew  their  leaders  and  administrators</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  populations  who  had  little  experience  or  skil   at  running  any  type  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">large-scale  enterprise.  In  many  cases,  especial y  in  Africa,  infrastructure</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherited from the departing colonial powers was rapidly looted, destroyed, </p>

<p class="calibre1">The  second  and  more  important  reason  why  poor  transportation  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">already  begun  to  happen.  Because  institutions  that  have  employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">compulsion  and  local  advantage  to  redistribute  income  are  losing  power, </p>
<p class="calibre1">income inequality  <i class="calibre4">within jurisdictions</i> wil  rise. Global competition wil  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">tend to increase the income earned by the most talented individuals in each</p>
<p class="calibre1">eld, wherever they live, much as it does now in professional athletics. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">marginal value generated by superior performance in a global market wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  public  debate  wil   focus  on  growing  “inequality”  in  the  OECD</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries,  individuals  everywhere  wil   enjoy  far  more  nearly  equal</p>
<p class="calibre1">272</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-376"></a>opportunity. They wil  no longer need to live in a jurisdiction that functions</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel  on a large scale in order to succeed. Innate abilities and the wil ingness to</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop them wil  be measured on a more equal playing  eld than ever before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jurisdictional  advantages  that  led  to  widening  inequality  between  rich  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor economies during the industrial period wil  change dramatical y. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Higher Returns in Poor Areas</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  obstacles  that  governments  in  poorer  regions  place  in  the  way  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">functioning  free  markets  wil   be  much  diminished  as  the  cybereconomy</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes on line. As a consequence, capital and skil s in short supply wil  in fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">earn higher returns in many currently poor areas, much as the development</p>
<p class="calibre1">theorists of the 1950s postulated they should. And both capital and skil s wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be far more readily importable. Emerging economies wil  no longer need to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rely as much as during the Industrial Age upon local factors of production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their enhanced ability to draw upon capital and expertise at a distance wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead to higher rates of growth. This wil  happen whether or not incompetent</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments become more honest or better able to protect property rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lacking power over cyberspace, bad governments wil  simply be less able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop people in their jurisdictions from bene ting from economic freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Positive Reinforcement</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  new  cybereconomy,  the  almost  total  portability  of  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  wil   prohibit  the  hoarding  of  many  of  the  jurisdictional</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages that arose in the Industrial Age. Enhanced competition between</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing numbers of jurisdictions wil  turn on new types of local advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereignty wil  be commercialized rather than predatory. Governments wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be obliged by the force of competition to set policies to appeal to those of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their customers who make the greatest contributions to economic wel -being, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  to  those  who  contribute  little  or  whose  economic  contributions  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This wil  represent a tremendous change from the common practice of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century.  The  ideology  of  the  nation-state  was  that  life  can  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  be  regulated  in  a  positive  way  by  subsidizing  undesirable  outcomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">273</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-432"></a>and penalizing desirable ones. To be poor is undesirable; therefore, the poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">were subsidized. To become rich is desirable; therefore, punitive taxes were</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid on the rich to make life more “fair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  this  whole  policy  approach  was  rooted  in  a  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">foundation  that  withstood  al   appeal,  it  mattered  little  what  the  perverse</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  of  subsidizing  dysfunction  were.  Nor  was  there  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">accounting for the skil , hard work, or ingenuity that went into earning the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth  that  was  redistributed.  Outcomes  were  measured  in  terms  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">entitlements. The twentieth-century political view assumed that in order for</p>
<p class="calibre1">outcomes to be “fair” they had to be equal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The New Paradigm</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  new  megapolitical  conditions  of  the  twenty- rst  century  wil   al ow</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  tests  to  regulate  outcomes  in  areas  formerly  dominated  by  politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  market  paradigm  presupposes  that  results  can  be  better  regulated  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewarding desirable outcomes and penalizing undesirable ones. To be poor is</p>
<p class="calibre1">undesirable,  and  to  become  rich  is  desirable.  Therefore,  incentives  should</p>
<p class="calibre1">reward  wealth  creation  and  encourage  people  to  pay  for  the  resources  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">consume. Life is more “fair” when people get to keep more of what they earn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a view that wil  be heard more frequently in the new mil ennium</p>
<p class="calibre1">than it was in the century now ending. Furthermore, it wil  be compel ing as</p>
<p class="calibre1">never  before  because  it  wil   be  megapolitical y  founded.  Capital  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age is growing more mobile by the moment. The capacity to</p>
<p class="calibre1">earn high income is no longer tied to residence in speci c locations, as was the</p>
<p class="calibre1">case when most wealth was created by manipulating natural resources. With</p>
<p class="calibre1">every  day  that  passes,  it  becomes  easier  for  people  using  highly  portable</p>
<p class="calibre1">information technology to create assets that are far less subject to the leverage</p>
<p class="calibre1">of violence than any form of wealth has ever been before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arbitrary  political  regulations  that  impose  costs  without  creating</p>
<p class="calibre1">o setting market bene ts wil  soon be nonviable. Powerful competitive forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">are tending to equalize the prices of goods, services, labor, and capital across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  globe.  Governments  wil   have  less  latitude  to  impose  arbitrary  policies</p>
<p class="calibre1">than they are accustomed to enjoy. Any government that attempts to impose</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  burdensome  regulations  on  an  activity  than  other  sovereignties  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">274</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-400"></a>simply  drive  that  activity  away.  In  some  cases,  of  course,  driving  away</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwanted activities wil  please the market and make those jurisdictions al  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  popular  and  prosperous.  In  this  sense,  certain  regulations  may  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared to the house rules imposed by the proprietors of a hotel chain. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">they prohibit people from walking barefoot or smoking in the lobby, they wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">no doubt lose certain customers. But turning away those customers may not</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost the jurisdiction customers overal , or even reduce its total revenues. Wel -</p>
<p class="calibre1">shod  nonsmokers  may  pay  more  precisely  because  barefoot  smokers  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">excluded. Equal y, regulations that make it costly or impossible to operate a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rendering  plant  in  a  certain  jurisdiction  may  drive  the  rendering  elsewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">without depriving the jurisdiction as a whole of income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These examples demonstrate how regulations may in rare circumstances</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a positive rather than a negative market value, especial y in a world with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  rapidly  multiplying  number  of  jurisdictions.  Rules  that  preserve  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards of public health, clean air, and clean water wil  be highly valued in</p>
<p class="calibre1">many locales. So wil  other, sometimes more exotic regulations and covenants</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the kind that might be imposed by real estate developers or hotels catering</p>
<p class="calibre1">to certain market segments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">No Customs House in Cyberspace</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  expect  the  commercialization  of  sovereignty  to  rapidly  lead  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution  of  many  large  territorial  sovereignties.  The  very  fact  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">information technology cannot be subjected to border controls of the kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">that can stil  impede the trade of manufactures and farm goods has important</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications.  It  means  that  protectionism  wil   be  less  e ective  over  time  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade in information displaces physical products in the generation of wealth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  also  means  that  smal er  regions  wil   be  ever  less  dependent  upon  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintenance  of  extensive  political  jurisdictions  in  order  to  assure  access  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets in which they can earn income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  technology  exposes  people  working  in  formerly  protected</p>
<p class="calibre1">service sectors to foreign competition. If a  rm in Toronto wished to hire a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bookkeeper  twenty  years  ago,  that  person  had  to  be  physical y  located  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toronto,  or  in  a  nearby  community  within  commuting  distance.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age, a bookkeeper in Budapest or Bangalore, India, could do the</p>
<p class="calibre1">275</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-494"></a>job,  and  download  al   the  material  needed  in  encrypted  form  over  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internet. Instant communication through satel ite links makes any part of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  only  a  moment  away  by  modem  and  fax.  Someone  in  need  of  stock</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysts could hire twenty-seven in India for the price of one on Wal  Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As information technology improves by a magnitude or more every eighteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">months (Moore’s Law), ever-greater numbers of service-sector workers wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed  to  price  competition  that  is  essential y  beyond  the  capacity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politicians to impede. This competition wil  eventual y apply as ful y to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned professions as to bookkeepers. Digital lawyers and cyberdoctors wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">proliferate in the Information Economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Death Watch for Nation-States</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  economic  bene ts  formerly  captured  within  the  boundaries  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states fal ing away, the nation-states themselves wil  eventual y col apse</p>
<p class="calibre1">under their weighty liabilities. But the fact that al  nation-states are on a death</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch does not mean that they are al  destined to expire at the same moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far  from  it.  Devolutionary  pressures  wil   tend  to  be  most  intense  in  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">political entities where incomes for most of the population are stagnant or</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal ing. Jurisdictions in Latin America and Asia where per capita income is</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising rapidly may endure for generations, or until lifetime income prospects</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  equate  with  those  in  the  formerly  rich  industrial  countries.  At  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">point, there wil  no longer be easy cost-substituting gains to be had, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics of growth wil  become more chal enging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  also  suspect  that  nation-states  with  a  single  major  metropolis  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">remain  coherent  longer  than  those  with  several  big  cities,  which  imply</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiple centers of interest with their various hinterlands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  spur  to  devolution  wil   be  high  indebtedness  of  the  central</p>
<p class="calibre1">government. The three wealthy industrial countries with the highest relative</p>
<p class="calibre1">indebtedness&mdash;Canada,  Belgium,  and  Italy&mdash;are  not  coincidental y  nations</p>
<p class="calibre1">with advanced separatist movements. Al  three countries have su ered from</p>
<p class="calibre1">chronic budget de cits and now have national debts that exceed 100 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  GDP.  As  the  national  debt  has  mounted  in  each  country,  the  appeal  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">separatist movements has grown as wel . In Italy, the Northern League has</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged as a dynamic and popular regional political movement. Its platform</p>
<p class="calibre1">276</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-347"></a>is  based  upon  a  simple  mathematical  observation:  northern  Italy,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Padonia,” would be richer than Switzerland if large portions of its income</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  siphoned  o   to  subsidize  Rome  and  the  poorer  south.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Northern League proposes an obvious solution: secede from Italy, and thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape from some of the dire consequences of compound interest. Likewise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Belgium,  where  the  national  debt  exceeds  130  percent  of  GDP,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flemings and Wal oons are maneuvering like a hostile couple before a divorce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  growing  minority  among  the  Flemings  argue  that  they  are  unfairly</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidizing  the  Wal oons,  and  could  improve  their  economic  condition  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">splitting Belgium in two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Canada’s  case  di ers  in  the  detail  that  French  Canada,  the  main  region</p>
<p class="calibre1">now  agitating  for  separatism,  has  historical y  been  subsidized  by  English</p>
<p class="calibre1">Canada. But as the federal debt and de cit mount, the realization is dawning</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Quebec  that  this  form  of  income  redistribution  wil   decline.  The  Bloc</p>
<p class="calibre1">Québecois is therefore  irting with an appeal that it lacked a decade ago&mdash;the</p>
<p class="calibre1">promise  to  raise  after-tax  income  by  abolishing  the  payment  of  Canadian</p>
<p class="calibre1">federal tax. Separatist leaders also suggest that Quebec should leave Canada</p>
<p class="calibre1">without shouldering a proportionate burden of the federal debt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">English Canadians resist this argument and tend to resent its implications</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they are keenly aware of the large transfers made to Quebec over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">years. Nonetheless, the appeal of the Parti Québecois is strong, and it seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">only a matter of time until a secession referendum dissolves Canada. A similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">fate awaits other nation-states when their  nancial circumstances deteriorate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  factor  that  bodes  il   for  Canada’s  long-term  survival  is  the  fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  it  is  a  thinly  populated  country  with  a  sprawling  industrial-era</p>
<p class="calibre1">infrastructure  to  maintain.  The  transition  to  the  Information  Age  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably  depreciating  physical  infrastructure.  As  telecommuters  replace</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory employees and o ce workers, it wil  matter less whether freeways and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  transportation  thoroughfares  are  rebuilt  and  wel -maintained.  With</p>
<p class="calibre1">scal crises pinching on al  sides, more and more factions in Canadian life wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreat to the eighteenth-century exclusionary view of the  nancing of public</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods advocated by Adam Smith. He wrote in  <i class="calibre4">The Wealth of Nations:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Were  the  streets  of  London  to  be  lighted  and  paved  at  the  expense  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">[national] treasury, is there any probability that they would be so wel  lighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">and paved as they are at present, or even at so smal  an expense. The expense, </p>
<p class="calibre1">277</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-191"></a>besides,  instead  of  being  raised  by  a  local  tax  upon  the  inhabitants  of  each particlar street, parish or district in London would, in this case, be defrayed out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the general revenue of the state, and would consequently be raised by a tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon al  the inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the greater part derived no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of bene t from the lighting and paving of the streets of London. <a href="#calibre_link-19">14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">For London, substitute Toronto, and you are inside an equation that wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">running in the minds of many in Alberta and British Columbia. The logic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution wil  prove infectious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Canada  breaks  apart,  this  wil   lead  to  a  marked  increase  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">secessionist activity in the Paci c Northwest of the United States. Residents</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana would  nd themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">at a distinct disadvantage in competition with Alberta and British Columbia</p>
<p class="calibre1">as independent sovereignties. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AFTER THE NATION-STATE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the place of nation-states you wil  see, at  rst, smal er jurisdictions at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">provincial  level,  and  ultimately,  smal er  sovereignties,  enclaves  of  various</p>
<p class="calibre1">kinds like medieval city-states surrounded by their hinterlands. As strange as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it may seem to people, inculcated with the importance of politics, policies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these new ministates wil  in many cases be informed more by entrepreneurial</p>
<p class="calibre1">positioning than by political wrangling. These new, fragmented sovereignties</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   cater  to  di erent  tastes,  just  as  hotels  and  restaurants  do,  enforcing</p>
<p class="calibre1">speci c  regulations  within  their  public  spaces  that  appeal  to  the  market</p>
<p class="calibre1">segments from, which they draw their customers. This is not to say, of course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that  there  are  not  special  problems  arising  from  the  organization  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection on a nomadic basis. We address these in the next chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Town air brings freedom.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;MEDIEVAL ADAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Noncitizens of the Pale</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">These di culties notwithstanding, human ingenuity usual y  nds a way to</p>
<p class="calibre1">create  institutions  to  capture  pro table  opportunities,  even  where  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">278</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-192"></a>demand  arises  from  persons  who  can  pay  little.  Where  the  potential</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers are among the wealthiest persons on earth, that tendency should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be al  the more emphatic. Exit, or “voting with your feet,” is always an option</p>
<p class="calibre1">when dated products, organizations, or even governments lose their appeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">and seem to o er little prospect of immediate improvement. Consider, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  the  growth  of  medieval  towns  that  served  as  safe  havens  for  serfs</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping feudal subjugation. Their role may prove analogous to the role of</p>
<p class="calibre1">new jurisdictions in accommodating the coming exit from nation-states. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceptance of aliens escaping from some lord as “citizens of the pale” de ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  prevailing  conventions  of  feudal  law  and  episcopal  authority.  But</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonetheless it was a general y successful alternative for those who employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, contributing importantly to weakening the grip of feudalism. As medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">historian Fritz Rorig put it, the serf of a secular lord would be “a free burgher</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  town  after  a  year  and  a  day.” <a href="#calibre_link-19">15</a>  It  is  reasonable  to  expect  new institutional  refuges  to  spring  up,  upon  “new  legal  principles,”  to  provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">scal refuge to citizens of the state, much as the medieval town o ered refuge</p>
<p class="calibre1">to feudal subjects who lived within the shadows of its wal s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Economist Albert O. Hirschman, who explored the theoretical subtleties</p>
<p class="calibre1">of “voting with your feet” in  <i class="calibre4">Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, </i>  rst published in 1969, </p>
<p class="calibre1">foresaw that technological advances would increase the likelihood of exit as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategy for dealing with states in decline. He wrote, “Only as countries start</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  resemble  each  other  because  of  the  advances  in  communication  and  al -</p>
<p class="calibre1">round modernization wil  the danger of premature and excessive exits arise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…” <a href="#calibre_link-19">16</a> That is precisely what is happening. Information technology is rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">diminishing many of the di erences among jurisdictions, making exit a much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  attractive  option.  Of  course,  “premature  and  excessive  exits”  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hirschman’s  vocabulary  are  understood  from  the  point  of  view  of  what  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimal  for  the  state  being  deserted.  No  doubt  lords  in  medieval  Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed that they su ered from “premature and excessive exits” of their serfs</p>
<p class="calibre1">into towns where they achieved freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To return to our earlier example, it is not as far-fetched as it might seem to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose  that  there  wil   be  a  number  of  ministates  o ering  refuge  to  exiles</p>
<p class="calibre1">eeing the dying nation-states. These sovereignties wil  compete on terms and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions of exile. Some, perhaps on the West Coast of North America, may</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel   cater  to  people  who  do  not  smoke  and  are  intolerant  of  secondhand</p>
<p class="calibre1">279</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-429"></a>smoke from those who do. Obviously, such regimes would not be popular</p>
<p class="calibre1">with smokers. Rules banning their habit wil  seem an arbitrary imposition to</p>
<p class="calibre1">many smokers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  industrial  era  of  mass  politics,  such  di erences  of  opinion  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">fought  out  in  political  campaigns  that  ultimately  forced  one  group  or  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other  to  abide  by  the  wishes  of  the  more  powerful.  But  it  is  by  no  means</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential that contentions about mutual y exclusive choices be settled in a way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that requires that the preferences of large numbers of people be suppressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some individuals like to eat foie gras and others like hot dogs, and others</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil   eat  soya  curd.  They  usual y  do  not  have  to  argue  about  their  diet</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferences  because  their  culinary  choices  are  not  bound  together.  No  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces al  to consume the same meal. Megapolitical conditions did, however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">force  common  consumption  of  many  kinds  of  col ective  and  even  private</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods  provided  by  governments  in  the  industrial  era.  Why?  Because  there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were great economic advantages to be captured by operating at a large scale. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  therefore  impractical  to  divide  sprawling  jurisdictions  into  enclaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  everyone  could  have  his  own  way,  even  on  important  items.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">exclusionary  approach  to  the  provision  of  public  goods  argued  by  Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith  can  be  far  more  easily  accommodated  when  the  number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions  multiplies  by  ten  or  even  a  hundred  times  over.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  growing  numbers  of  sovereignties  wil   be  smal   enclaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than continental empires. Some may be North American Indian bands</p>
<p class="calibre1">who wil  claim tax jurisdiction over their reservations and reserves much as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they now claim the right to operate gambling casinos or to  sh in de ance of</p>
<p class="calibre1">limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  information  technology  eliminates  many  of  the  drawbacks  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolving  trading  areas,  it  wil   be  practical  for  the  new  sovereignties  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">operate  more  on  the  principles  of  clubs  or  a nity  groups  than  those  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">governed territorial nation-states. Just as it is not crucial that every  <i class="calibre4">potential</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  share  the  same  taste  in  clothes,  or  watch  the  same  television</p>
<p class="calibre1">programs, it wil  be less important than it may seem that everyone agree with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a nity points that de ne the governing style of fragmented sovereignties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Widely dispersed tastes wil  result in widely divergent styles of fragmented</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty, much as there are increasingly wide choices in clothing style or</p>
<p class="calibre1">television broadcasts. Some microstates may even be linked like hotel groups</p>

<p class="calibre1">A peculiar irony of the re-emergence of micro-sovereignties or “city-states” </p>
<p class="calibre1">is that it may coincide with the emptying out of many cities. The large city</p>
<p class="calibre1">was largely an artifact of industrialism in the West. It arose with the factory</p>
<p class="calibre1">system to capture scale economies in the manufacture of products with high</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural resource content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the nineteenth century opened, cities of more than 100,000 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered  huge,  and  outside  of  Asia,  where  population  statistics  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubtful, there were no cities of more than a mil ion persons. The largest city</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the United States in 1800 was Philadelphia, with a population of 69,403. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New York had just 60,489. Baltimore was the third largest city in America</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  26,114  inhabitants. <a href="#calibre_link-19">18</a>  Most  of  what  were  to  become  the  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">metropolitan  cities  of  Europe  had  populations  that  are  tiny  by  twentieth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century standards. London, with a population of 864,845, was probably the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biggest  city  in  the  world.  Paris,  with  547,756,  was  the  only  other  city  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe  with  more  than  half  a  mil ion  inhabitants  in  1801<a href="#calibre_link-19">.19  </a>Lisbon’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">population was 350,000<a href="#calibre_link-19">.20</a> Vienna had a population of 252,000<a href="#calibre_link-19">.21 </a>Berlin had barely poked above 200,000 by 1819. <a href="#calibre_link-19">22</a> Madrid was home to 156,670. <a href="#calibre_link-19">23 </a>The 281</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-194"></a>population of Brussels in 1802 was 66,297. Budapest had a population of just</p>
<p class="calibre1">61,000. <a href="#calibre_link-19">24</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an obvious temptation to think that the growth of big cities is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">direct  function  of  population  growth.  But  this  is  not  necessarily  so.  Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">human  on  earth  could  be  packed  into  Texas,  with  each  family  living  in  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">own detached house with a yard, and stil  have some of Texas left over. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adna Weber argued in the classic study  <i class="calibre4">The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Century, </i> population growth alone does not explain why people live in urban</p>
<p class="calibre1">settings rather than dispersed in the countryside. In 1890, Bengal had about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same population density as England. Yet Bengal’s urban population was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just 4.8 percent, while England’s was 61.7 percent. <a href="#calibre_link-19">25</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Historical y, cities were wal ed o  from the countryside to keep marauders</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  lower  classes  out.  The  growth  of  industrial  employment  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth and twentieth centuries created big cities. Now the big city has</p>
<p class="calibre1">become highly vulnerable to breakdown as industrialism has begun, to fade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The perfect marker of this development is Detroit, the leading industrial city</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  mid-twentieth  century.  At  one  time,  a  large  fraction  of  the  world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  output  passed  through  Detroit.  Now  it  is  a  hol owed-out  shel , </p>
<p class="calibre1">ridden by crime and disorder. In many blocks of downtown Detroit, one or</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  derelict  buildings  have  been  burned  to  the  ground  or  torn  down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving the impression that the city has survived a series of raids by World War</p>
<p class="calibre1">II bombers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detroit  stands  as  a  reminder  that  many  industrial  cities  are  no  longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">viable.  They  wil   crumble  away  as  information  and  ideas  become  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important factors imparting value than fabricating from natural resources. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  cases,  the  large  city  has  already  grown  too  large  to  support  its  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight. To keep a metropolis functioning requires that a substantial number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  support  systems  operate  e ectively  at  large  scale.  The  very  crowding</p>
<p class="calibre1">together of mil ions of people implies a huge jump in vulnerability to crime, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotage,  and  random  violence.  During  the  industrial  era,  the  price  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">policing  against  these  risks  was  repaid  by  the  high-scale  economies  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  Information  Age,  only  cities  that  repay  their  upkeep  costs  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">o ering a high quality of life wil  remain viable. Persons at a distance wil  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be obliged to subsidize them. A good marker for the viability of cities</p>
<p class="calibre1">282</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-401"></a>is  whether  those  living  at  the  core  of  the  city  are  richer  than  those  on  its periphery. Buenos Aires, London, and Paris wil  remain inviting places to live</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  do  business  long  after  the  last  good  restaurant  closes  in  South  Bend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louisvil e, and Philadelphia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Country States</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some  city-states  may  prove  to  be  merely  enclaves  with  no  cities  attached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps they might be better thought of as vil age states or country states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural  resource  endowments  wil   be  valued  in  di erent  ways  as  wel . </p>
<p class="calibre1">When you can do business anywhere, you may wel  choose to do business in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful  place  where  you  can  breathe  deeply  without  inhaling  too  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">carcinogenic  pol ution.  Communications  technologies  that  minimize</p>
<p class="calibre1">language di culties wil  make it ever easier to abide almost anywhere that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment is attractive. Thinly populated regions with temperate climates, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  a  large  endowment  of  arable  land  per  head,  like  New  Zealand  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Argentina, wil  also enjoy a comparative advantage because they enjoy high</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards of public health and are low-cost producers of foods and renewable</p>
<p class="calibre1">products.  Such  products  wil   bene t  from  increased  demand  as  the  living</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards of bil ions of people in East Asia and Latin America rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Inequivalence Theorem</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  of  the  assumptions  of  economists  about  behavior  are  rooted  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tyranny  of  place.  A  distinct  example  is  Ricardo’s  “Equivalence  Theorem,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which suggests that citizens in a country that runs huge de cits wil  adjust</p>
<p class="calibre1">their expectations in anticipation of higher tax rates needed in the future to</p>
<p class="calibre1">retire  the  debt.  In  this  sense,  there  is  an  “equivalence”  between  nancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">spending  by  taxation  and  through  debt.  At  least  there  was  such  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalence  in  the  early  nineteenth  century  when  Ricardo  wrote.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  however,  the  rational  person  wil   not  respond  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prospect of higher taxes to fund de cits by increasing his savings rate; he wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">transfer his domicile, or lodge his transactions elsewhere. For the same reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">that producers sort among suppliers in search of the lowest costs, they wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">even more strongly motivated to seek alternative suppliers of protection. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">283</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-327"></a>bene ts of doing so wil  dwarf the margins to be realized by shifting to a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplier  of  plastic  tubes.  The  result  to  be  expected  is  that  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals  and  other  rational  people  wil   ee  jurisdictions  with  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfunded liabilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheap  governments  that  have  few  liabilities  and  impose  low  costs  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers  wil   be  the  domiciles  of  choice  for  wealth  creation  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age.  This  implies  much  more  attractive  prospects  for  doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">business  in  areas  where  indebtedness  is  low  and  governments  have  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">been restructured, such as New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and other parts of Asia and Latin America. These areas wil  also be superior</p>
<p class="calibre1">platforms for doing business to unreformed, high-cost economies in North</p>
<p class="calibre1">America and Western Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Erosion of Local Price Anomalies</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Greatly reduced information costs wil  obviate most local pricing advantages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only wil  buyers be able to scan an immense number of outlets in search</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the lowest prices on tradable goods; they wil  also be able to employ remote</p>
<p class="calibre1">services  to  shop  across  jurisdictional  boundaries.  This  wil   al ow  people  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  more  easily  compare  features  of  di cult-to-analyze  products  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">insurance.  And  it  wil   bypass  restraints  of  trade  imposed  by  local  licensing</p>
<p class="calibre1">procedures. Consequently, pro t margins are likely to fal  in any  eld where</p>
<p class="calibre1">local  price  anomalies  can  be  eroded  by  additional  information  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NEW ORGANIZATIONAL IMPERATIVES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cybereconomy  wil   signi cantly  di er  from  the  industrial  economy  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way its participants interact. Information technology wil  dissipate many</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  long-term  organizational  advantages  of  rms  that  arise  from  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">transaction and information costs. The Information Age wil  be the age of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the “virtual corporation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  analysts  more  knowledgable  than  we  are  about  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology have utterly failed to see that it is destined to transform the logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  economic  organization.  Not  only  does  the  new  technology  transcend</p>
<p class="calibre1">284</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-195"></a>borders  and  barriers;  it  also  revolutionizes  the  “internal”  costs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">computation. Even the few businesses that wil  not be a ected by exposure to</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  cross-border  competition  because  of  improving  information  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication  technology  wil   be  exposed  to  new  organizational</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperatives. Rapidly fal ing information and transaction costs wil  decisively</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower  economies  to  scale,  voiding  many  of  the  incentives  that  gave  rise  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-lived  rms and career employment during the industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Why Firms? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The classical economists like Adam Smith were almost silent on the question</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  rm size. They did not address what in uences the optimal size of  rms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">why  rms  take  the  form  they  do,  or  even  why  rms  exist  at  al .  Why  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs hire employees, rather than placing every task that needs doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  to  bid  among  independent  contractors  in  the  auction  market?  Nobel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prize-winning  economist  Ronald  Coase  helped  launch  a  new  direction  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">economics  by  asking  some  of  these  important  questions.  The  answers  he</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped  to  frame  hint  at  the  revolutionary  consequences  of  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  for  the  structure  of  business.  Coase  argued  that  rms  were  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">e cient way to overcome information de cits and high transaction costs<a href="#calibre_link-19">.26</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Information and Transaction Costs</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To see why, consider the obstacles you would have faced in trying to operate</p>
<p class="calibre1">an  industrial-era  assembly  line  without  a  single  rm  to  coordinate  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities.  In  principle,  an  automobile  could  have  been  produced  without</p>
<p class="calibre1">production being centralized under the oversight of a single  rm. Economist</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oliver  Wil iamson,  along  with  Coase,  is  another  pioneer  in  developing  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory of the  rm. Wil iamson de ned six di erent methods of operation and</p>
<p class="calibre1">control.  Among  them  is  the  “entrepreneurial  mode,”  “wherein  each</p>
<p class="calibre1">workstation  is  owned  and  operated  by  a  specialist.” <a href="#calibre_link-19">27</a>  Another  is  what Wil iamson  cal s  the  “federated  workstations”  in  which  “an  intermediate</p>
<p class="calibre1">product is transferred across stages by each worker. <a href="#calibre_link-19">”28 </a>There is no physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason why the thousands of employees could not have been replaced by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaggle  of  independent  contractors,  each  renting  space  on  the  factory  oor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">285</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-434"></a>bidding for parts, and o ering to assemble the axle or weld the fenders onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  chassis.  Yet  you  would  look  in  vain  for  an  example  of  an  industrial-era</p>
<p class="calibre1">automobile factory organized and run by independent contractors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Coordination Problems</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Operating an industrial facility without the bene t of coordination through a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single  rm  would  have  dissipated  most  of  the  economies  to  be  realized  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">operating  on  a  large  scale.  Massive  transaction  problems  in  coordinating  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">patchwork  quilt  of  smal   rms  would  have  e ectively  deautomated  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembly line. To work at al , such a system would have necessitated nonstop</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiation  among  the  individual  contractors.  Instead  of  focusing  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">production, the multitude of contractors or entrepreneurs would have had to</p>
<p class="calibre1">divert time and attention to  xing prices of components and working out the</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms  of  their  own  constantly  changing  interactions.  Simply  monitoring</p>
<p class="calibre1">production would have been a di cult problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Authority to Act</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With  such  a  set  of  independent  organizations  struggling  to  assemble  a  car, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creation and re-engineering of the models would have been a nightmare. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">need only imagine the di culty facing the designer in attempting to convince</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hundreds of independent contractors on changes required to introduce a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new model. In practice, almost unanimous consent would have been needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone  holding  out  or  objecting  to  any  change  in  the  speci cation  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">product could either have e ectively kil ed the model improvement or raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cost of introducing it, thus further jeopardizing the gains from operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">on a large scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Unnecessary Negotiation</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An  assembly  line  rented  (or  owned  separately)  by  independent  contractors</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  been  subject  to  numerous  vulnerabilities  avoided  by  operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">within  a  single  rm.  The  death,  il ness,  or  nancial  failure  of  individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">contractors  would  have  been  an  altogether  too  common  occurrence  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">286</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-495"></a>operations requiring the cooperation of thousands of people to build a single</p>
<p class="calibre1">product under one roof. The auction market would certainly have been able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  replace  these  contractors.  But  each  succession  would  have  required  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiated  settlement,  such  as  a  buyout  of  the  previous  operator  by  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">replacement. It also would have required an agreement on assumption of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rental of the factory space, and perhaps a new lease on the welding machine</p>
<p class="calibre1">or the press used for stamping out the tail ight sockets. Al  of this would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been complicated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Incentive Traps</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another crucial di culty with an assembly line of independent contractors</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the conditions of the Industrial Age was that capital requirements for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the individual contractors would have di ered dramatical y. A plastic mold</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  to  produce  a  dashboard  switch,  for  example,  might  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">relatively cheap, while the equipment needed to cast an engine block or stamp</p>
<p class="calibre1">out the sheet metal on a fender could have cost mil ions. The high resource</p>
<p class="calibre1">content  and  sequential  nature  of  assembly-line  production  made  problems</p>
<p class="calibre1">arising  from  high  capital  costs  inevitable,  for  reasons  analyzed  in  the  last</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapter. Contractors with, capital-intensive tasks would have essential y been</p>
<p class="calibre1">dependent  upon  the  cooperation  of  others  to  amortize  their  investments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ability  of  the  contractors  with  higher  capital  requirements  to  raise</p>
<p class="calibre1">money and operate at a pro t would have depended upon their securing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation  of  many  other  participants  in  the  process  whose  capital  costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">were far lower. In many cases, they would not have gotten it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There would have been a substantial incentive for the smal  to exploit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">great. Those who required less money to operate their particular function on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the assembly line would have gained by failing to cooperate at crucial times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like striking workers, they could have closed down the assembly line on one</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretext or another, imposing little cost on themselves but much grief to those</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  larger  capital  investments.  The  production  process  would  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject to constant gaming, with smal -scale contractors exposing those with</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher  capital  costs  to  ransom  through  their  ability  to  thwart  output.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">maneuvering of smal er contractors to extract side payments from the large</p>

<p class="calibre1">operating an assembly line on a large scale would have been dissipated if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">production  had  been  divided  among  multitudes  of  individual  contractors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  single  large  rm  was  an  e cient  way  of  overcoming  these  drawbacks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">notwithstanding its other limitations. Big business was bureaucratic. But to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  extent  bureaucracy  and  hierarchy  were  precisely  what  were  required</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the Industrial Age. Administrative and management teams monitored</p>
<p class="calibre1">and coordinated production, with numerous middle managers passing orders</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the hierarchy and other information back up the chain of command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  corporate  bureaucracy  also  provided  bookkeeping  and  accounting</p>
<p class="calibre1">controls and minimized principal-agency problems, in which employees fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  act  in  the  best  interest  of  the  rm  that  employs  them.  To  achieve</p>
<p class="calibre1">sophisticated  accountancy  under  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age  required</p>
<p class="calibre1">the work of many people. Having such an administrative bureaucracy in place</p>
<p class="calibre1">was costly. It had to be paid whether production was active or slack. Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">such administrators held crucial knowledge necessary to operate the business, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  were  usual y  paid  a  premium  above  what  their  skil s  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanded in the spot market. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Organizational Slack” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The large numbers of professional managers and administrators also had the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawback  of  tending  to  “capture”  the  rm  and  operate  it  in  their  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests rather than those of the shareholders. It was not uncommon in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  era,  for  example,  to  nd  rms  spending  lavishly  on  o ce</p>
<p class="calibre1">furnishings,  club  memberships,  and  other  perks  that  could  be  enjoyed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">management but that might not have generated a direct return to investors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  complicated  business,  it  was  impossible  to  easily  monitor  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside  which  overhead  expenditures  were  essential  and  which  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulgences  for  the  employees.  It  was  also  di cult  to  prevent  a  sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerable fraction of corporate employees from shirking. The fact that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  technological y  di cult  to  monitor  performance  made  a  large  middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">management necessary, and at the same time made it di cult to monitor the</p>
<p class="calibre1">monitors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As  an  entity  aspiring  to  permanence,  the  large  industrial  rm  had  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawback we have already explored of being exposed to shakedowns by labor</p>
<p class="calibre1">unions.  It  also  shared  some  of  the  characteristics  of  bureaucracy  seen  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">more exaggerated form in government o ces. Orders  owed from on high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tasks  were  stereotyped  and  compartmentalized.  These  tasks  were  often</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigidly  de ned.  Boundaries  emerged  among  job  categories,  akin  to  those</p>
<p class="calibre1">enforced by the cartels regulating the learned professions. To have expected a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bookkeeper to change a burned-out lightbulb in a lamp on his desk seemed as</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange to many during the Industrial Age as cal ing on a lawyer to help cure</p>
<p class="calibre1">your  u. Employees were neither expected, nor in many cases even permitted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to  cross  the  compartmentalized  boundaries  between  rigidly  de ned</p>
<p class="calibre1">functions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That  is  not  my  job”  was  a  widely  heard  slogan  that  underscored  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“organizational  slack”  of  the  Industrial  Age.  Everyone’s  job  was  precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">de ned  in  terms  of  stereotyped  tasks  that  were  not  to  be  trespassed  upon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however  much  that  might  improve  productivity.  Each  employee  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate bureaucracy was hired according to “quali cations” deemed likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  predict  performance  in  his  speci c  function.  With  few  exceptions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone was paid based upon a job classi cation, with more or less uniform</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay  throughout  the  organization.  Because  speci c  performance  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">administrative hierarchies of Big Business often went unmeasured, as in state</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucracies,  work  proceeded  at  a  leisurely  pace.  So  while  the  rm  did</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-197"></a>capture the scale economies of mass production, it did so at the cost of other</p>

<p class="calibre1">The new megapolitical conditions of the Information Age wil  signi cantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">alter the logic of business organization. Part of this is obvious. If information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  does  nothing  else,  it  dramatical y  lowers  the  cost  of  processing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">computing, and analyzing information. One e ect of such technology is to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduce the necessity of hiring large numbers of middle managers to monitor</p>
<p class="calibre1">production  processes.  Indeed,  automated  machine  tools  made  possible  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">advanced computational power are in many cases replacing hourly workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And where the production process continues to be manned, the control and</p>
<p class="calibre1">coordination  process  has  largely  been  automated.  Equipment  tted  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">microprocessors can monitor the progress of the assembly line much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ectively  than  managers  ever  could.  Not  only  can  the  new  equipment</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure  the  speed  and  accuracy  with  which  people  work,  it  can  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">automatical y compile accounts, and reorder components the moment they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are taken out of inventory. The smal est operations can now a ord  nancial</p>
<p class="calibre1">control  programs  that  account  for  their  nances  with  greater  speed  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sophistication than even the largest corporations could have achieved through</p>
<p class="calibre1">their production hierarchies a few decades ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that information technology al ows for dispersed, nonsequential</p>
<p class="calibre1">output  of  products  with  reduced  natural  resource  content  dramatical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduces  the  vulnerability  to  gaming  and  extortion,  as  we  have  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">explored.  However,  these  are  not  the  only  characteristics  of  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  that  make  it  ever  more  attractive  to  contract  out  functions</p>
<p class="calibre1">formerly  done  by  employees.  Capital  costs  are  lower.  Product  cycles  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">290</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-198"></a>shorter. The independent contractors themselves, including the one-person</p>
<p class="calibre1">rms, have vastly more sophisticated information networks at their disposal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon they wil  be able to rely upon an array of digital servants to perform a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide  variety  of  o ce  functions,  from  answering  the  phone  to  secretarial</p>
<p class="calibre1">services. Digital servants wil  be secretaries, advertising agents, travel agents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bank tel ers, and bureaucrats. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Disappearance of Good Jobs</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To an increasing degree, individuals capable of creating signi cant economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">value  wil   be  able  to  retain  most  of  the  value  they  create  for  themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Support sta  that previously absorbed a large part of the revenue generated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the principal income creators in an enterprise wil  be replaced by low-cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">automated agents and information systems. This implies that an organization</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   be  better  able  to  assure  itself  of  the  highest  quality  of  service  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">contracting it out, rather than by keeping the function within the  rm, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">it wil  be relatively more di cult to reward individuals for performing a task</p>
<p class="calibre1">wel .  A  virtual  corporation  wil   eliminate  most  “organizational  slack”  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">eliminating the organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good  jobs”  wil   be  a  thing  of  the  past.  A  “good  job,”  as  Princeton</p>
<p class="calibre1">economist  Orly  Ashenfelter  put  it,  “is  a  job  that  pays  more  than  you  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”32</a>  In  the  Industrial  Age,  many  “good  jobs”  existed  because  of  high information and transaction costs. Firms grew bigger and internalized a wider</p>
<p class="calibre1">range of functions because doing so al owed them to capture scale economies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporate  bloat  was  also  subsidized  by  tax  laws.  The  high  taxes  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominated in the late stages of the industrial era arti cial y magni ed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages of forming a long-lived  rm and hiring permanent employees. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  nations,  tax  laws  and  regulations  substantial y  raised  the  costs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming  and  dissolving  rms  on  a  project  basis.  They  also  have  tended  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">force entrepreneurs to subsume independent contractors as employees. Legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">interventions  further  temporarily  in ated  the  supply  of  “good  jobs”  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">making it costly and di cult to dismiss an employee, however little he might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be contributing to the productivity of the  rm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably  and  logical y,  the  character  of  business  organization  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial era assured that the most highly skil ed and talented people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">291</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-199"></a>created a disproportionate share of the value-added in an organization were</p>
<p class="calibre1">paid proportionately less than their contribution was worth. This wil  change</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  microprocessing  revolution  is  sharply  increasing  the  availability  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  and  reducing  transaction  costs.  This  is  devolving  the  rm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead  of  permanent  bureaucracy,  activities  wil   be  organized  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">projects, in much the way that movie companies already operate. Most of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">formerly “internal” functions of the  rm wil  be outsourced to independent</p>
<p class="calibre1">contractors.  The  industrial-era  employees  who  held  “good  jobs”  but  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">contributed  little  and  relied  upon  fel ow  workers  to  “cover”  for  them  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon  nd themselves bidding for contracts in the spot market. And so wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">many loyal, diligent employees. “Good jobs” wil  be an anachronism because</p>
<p class="calibre1">jobs in general wil  be anachronistic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the extreme case of big Japanese corporations, employees expected to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a job for life. Even where they had no productive task to perform, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be retained, sometimes merely showing up to sit at “a bare desk in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner of a factory.” Now even in Japan, the bloated white-col ar workforce is</p>
<p class="calibre1">being  downsized.  The  headline  of  a  story  in  the   <i class="calibre4">International  Herald-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tribune</i>  told  the  tale:  “Parting  Is  Such  Sour  Sorrow:  Japan’s  Job-for-Life</p>
<p class="calibre1">Culture Painful y Expires. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”33</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the postindustrial period, jobs wil  be tasks you do, not something you</p>
<p class="calibre1">“have.”  Before  the  industrial  era,  permanent  employment  was  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown. As Wil iam Bridges put it, “Before 1800&mdash;and long after in many</p>
<p class="calibre1">cases <i class="calibre4">&mdash;job</i> always referred to some particular task or undertaking, never to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">role  or  position  in  an  organization.…  Between  1700  and  1890,  the   <i class="calibre4">Oxford</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">English Dictionary</i>  nds many uses of terms like  <i class="calibre4">job-coachman, job-doctor, </i> and</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">job-gardener</i>&mdash;al   referring  to  people  hired  on  a  one-time  basis.  <i class="calibre4">Job-work</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(another frequent term) was occasional work, not regular employment. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”34 </a>In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age, most tasks that were formerly captured within  rms as</p>
<p class="calibre1">an expedient to reduce information and transaction costs wil  migrate back to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spot market. “Just in time” inventory control and outsourcing are both</p>
<p class="calibre1">practical because of information technology. They are steps toward the death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  jobs.  Already,  major  corporations  such  as  AT&amp;T  have  eliminated  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">permanent job categories. Positions in that large  rm are now contingent. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bridges’s words, “Employment is becoming temporary and situational again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">292</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-200"></a>and  categories  are  losing  their  boundaries.” <a href="#calibre_link-20">35</a>  In  the  new  cybereconomy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“independent  contractors”  wil   telecommute  across  continents  to  nest</p>
<p class="calibre1">together on the Information Age equivalent of the assembly line. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Hollywood Takes Over</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The model business organization of the new information economy may be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">movie production company. Such enterprises can be very sophisticated, with</p>
<p class="calibre1">budgets  of  hundreds  of  mil ions  of  dol ars.  While  they  are  often  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations, they are also temporary in nature. A movie company producing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lm for $100 mil ion may come together for a year and then dissolve. While</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  people  who  work  on  the  production  are  talented,  they  have  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation  that  nding  work  on  the  project  is  equivalent  to  having  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“permanent  job.”  When  the  project  is  over,  the  lighting  technicians, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cameramen, sound engineers, and wardrobe specialists wil  go their separate</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways. They may be reunited in another project, or they may not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  scale  economies  fal ,  and  capital  requirements  for  many  types  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">information-intensive  activities  fal   simultaneously,  there  wil   be  a  strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentive for  rms to dissolve. Business operations wil  be more ad hoc and</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary. Firms wil  tend to be more short-lived. Virtual corporations that</p>
<p class="calibre1">assemble  talents  for  speci c  purposes  wil   be  more  e cient  than  long-</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing companies. As encryption becomes widespread and the taxation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital is forced down by competition, arti cial scale economies that sustain</p>
<p class="calibre1">the existence of “permanent”  rms wil  fal  away. This wil  happen whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes  are  reduced  rapidly  or  slowly.  If  rapidly,  the  arti cial  costs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">functioning on a project basis wil  disappear more quickly. If slowly, the main</p>
<p class="calibre1">burden of paying the anachronistical y high taxes wil  fal  upon existing  rms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while  new  enterprises  wil   operate  as  virtual  corporations,  better  enabling</p>
<p class="calibre1">them to escape costly burdens imposed by the dying nation-state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  special  skil s  and  talents  wil   be  more  important  than  ever  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information economy, most of the arti cial boundaries between professions</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   dissolve.  Advanced  information  and  retrieval  storage  technologies  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">make the trade secrets and specialized information of professions such as law, </p>
<p class="calibre1">medicine,  and  accounting  available  to  anyone.  The  economic  value  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">293</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-201"></a>memorization  as  a  skil   wil   fal ,  while  the  importance  of  synthesis  and creative application of information wil  rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ful   implications  of  this  change  wil   be  retarded  by  antiquated</p>
<p class="calibre1">regulation. But over the longer term, the power of governments to regulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cybereconomy wil  wither to the vanishing point. Any arti cial regulation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of professional monopolies that raises costs without bene ts that are valued</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the market wil  ultimately be ignored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are other implications of the shift to an information economy:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Local regulations that impose higher costs wil  be transformed to a market</p>
<p class="calibre1">footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  wil   be  intensi ed  competition  among  jurisdictions  to  domicile</p>
<p class="calibre1">high  value-added  activities  that  in  principle  could  be  located  anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No stopping place is necessarily more compel ing than the next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business  relations  wil   gravitate  toward  reliance  upon  “circles  of  trust.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Due to encryption, which gives individuals an ability to steal undetected, </p>
<p class="calibre1">honesty wil  be a more highly valued characteristic of business associates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patent and copyright regimes wil  change, due to ease of access to certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Protection  wil   become  increasingly  technological  rather  than  juridical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lower classes wil  be wal ed out. The move to gated communities is al</p>
<p class="calibre1">but  inevitable.  Wal ing  out  troublemakers  is  an  e ective  as  wel   as</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional way of minimizing criminal violence in times of weak central</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulk  goods  wil   be  heavily  taxed  and  shipped  local y,  as  in  the  Middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ages,  while  luxury  goods  wil   be  lightly  taxed  and  shipped  a  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance<a href="#calibre_link-20">.36</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Police functions wil  increasingly be taken up by private guards linked to</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchant associations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There may be a transitional advantage to private over publicly traded  rms</p>
<p class="calibre1">because private  rms wil  enjoy greater leeway in escaping costs imposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by governments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifetime employment wil  disappear as “jobs” increasingly become tasks or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“piece work” rather than positions within an organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">294</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-371"></a>Control over economic resources wil  shift away from the state to persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">of superior skil s and intel igence, as it becomes increasingly easy to create</p>

<p class="calibre1">Many  members  of  learned  professions  wil   be  displaced  by  interactive</p>
<p class="calibre1">information-retrieval systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New  survival  strategies  for  persons  of  lower  intel igence  wil   evolve, </p>
<p class="calibre1">involving  greater  concentration  on  development  of  leisure  skil s,  sports</p>
<p class="calibre1">abilities, and crime, as wel  as service to the growing numbers of Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Political systems that grew up at a time when there were rising returns to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  must  undergo  wrenching  adjustments.  Now  that  e ciency  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing in importance relative to the magnitude of power commanded by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">system, smal , e cient sovereignties, which produce more protection for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers at lower cost, wil  be increasingly sustainable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in the medieval period, there are once again growing diseconomies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale in the organization of violence. This is already re ected in the growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">number  of  sovereign  entities  since  the  fal   of  Communism.  We  expect  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">number of sovereignties in the world to multiply rapidly as the logic of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age is con rmed by experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Power wil  once again be exercised on a smal  scale. Enclaves and provinces</p>
<p class="calibre1">may  even  nd  that  they  have  substantial  advantages  over  nations  spanning</p>
<p class="calibre1">continents in o ering competitive terms to their “customers” for sovereignty</p>
<p class="calibre1">services. This wil  be very di erent from the rapidly dying modern period, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which no entity could survive unless it could control military force su cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">to control a kingdom. In the past, when there were diseconomies of scale in</p>

<p class="calibre1">wealthy  merchants  in  the  late  medieval  city-states,  did  control  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">government.  In  our  view,  you  can  look  for  something  like  this  again.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowering  of  predatory  burdens  and  more  e cient  disposition  of  resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">should result in rapid growth in areas where customers do exercise control</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the local sovereignties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we explore next, whether these developments can or should proceed in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  face  of  opposition  from  legions  of  losers  wil   be  among  the  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important controversies of the Information Age. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;WILLIAM PFAFF</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/"> <i class="calibre4">http://www.ibm.com</i> </a>To say that the “world is getting smal er” is an informing gure of speech, reinforced by authorities as prestigious as IBM’s advertising</p>
<p class="calibre1">agency.  Their  “Solutions  for  a  smal   planet”  multicultural  commercials  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Internet remind sports fans who may fail to realize it on their own that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  terms  of  relations  between  individuals  in  widely  dispersed  jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  been  changed  by  technology.  We  refer  to  the  distinguished  historian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wil iam  McNeil   for  a  useful  footnote  on  the  implications.  He  writes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Continuing  intensi cation  of  communications  and  transport,  instead  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">favoring  national  consolidation,  has  begun  to  work  in  a  contrary  sense, </p>
<p class="calibre1">inasmuch as its range transcends existing political and ethnic boundaries.” <a href="#calibre_link-20">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As the world “becomes smal er” and communications improve, the accidental</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  “intrinsical y  absurd”  claims  of  nations  and  nationalism  are  bound  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">296</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-203"></a><b class="calibre3">THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  trouble  with  this  reasonable  expectation  is  that  al   previous  history</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggests that it cannot be accommodated in a reasonable way. The transition</p>
<p class="calibre1">it implies wil  involve a crisis. It entails a radical y new way of thinking, a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagining  of  community  that  moves  beyond  nationalism  and  the  nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">state. As Michael Bil ig has highlighted, “our beliefs about nationhood, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  the  naturalness  of  belonging  to  a  nation,”  are  “the  products  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular  historical  age. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”3</a>  That  age,  the  Modern  Age,  may  already  be defunct.  Its  predominant  institutions,  nation-states,  stil   endure,  but  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive  precariously  upon  an  eroded  foundation.  As  the  other  shoe  drops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  nation-states  col apse,  we  expect  a  nasty  reaction,  particularly  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy  countries  where  the  “national  economy”  brought  high  income  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">unskil ed work in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  when  al   is  said  and  done,  the  change  in  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions occasioned by the advent of information technology wil  result in</p>
<p class="calibre1">radical institutional change. The thesis of this book is that the massed power</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the nation-state is destined to be privatized and commercialized. Like al</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly radical institutional change, the privatization and commercialization of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty wil  involve a revolution in the “common sense” of the way the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  is  comprehended.  Such  change  seldom  happens  in  a  gradual,  linear</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. To the contrary. Indeed, for reasons we explored in  <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">it  is  practical y  ruled  out.  We  expect  the  Information  Age  to  bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">discontinuities&mdash;sharp breaks with the institutions and the consciousness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the past. Here is what to look for as the process unfolds:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Changes  in  economic  organization  of  the  kind  described  in  previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapters arising from the impact of microprocessing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. A  more  or  less  rapid  fal o   in  importance  of  al   organizations  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">operate  within  rather  than  beyond  geographic  boundaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments, labor unions, licensed professions, and lobbyists wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">less  important  in  the  Information  Age  than  they  became  during  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial  Age.  Because  favors  and  restraints  of  trade  wrested  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  wil   be  less  useful,  fewer  resources  wil   be  wasted  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobbying. <a href="#calibre_link-20">4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">297</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>3. Wider  recognition  that  the  nation-state  is  obsolete,  leading  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">widespread secession movements in many parts of the globe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. A decline in the status and power of traditional elites, as wel  as a decline</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the respect accorded the symbols and beliefs that justify the nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. An intense and even violent nationalist reaction centered among those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who lose status, income, and power when what they consider to be their</p>
<p class="calibre1">“ordinary  life”  is  disrupted  by  political  devolution  and  new  market</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements. Among the features of this reaction:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a. suspicion  of  and  opposition  to  globalization,  free  trade,  “foreign” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership and penetration of local economies; </p>
<p class="calibre1">b. hostility to immigration, especial y of groups that are visibly di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the former national group; </p>
<p class="calibre1">c. popular  hatred  of  the  information  elite,  rich  people,  the  wel -</p>
<p class="calibre1">educated, and complaints about capital  ight and disappearing jobs; </p>
<p class="calibre1">d. extreme measures by nationalists intent upon halting the secession of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals and regions from faltering nation-states, including resort</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  wars  and  acts  of  “ethnic  cleansing”  that  reinforce  nationalist</p>
<p class="calibre1">identi cation  with  the  state  and  rationalize  the  state’s  claims  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">people and their resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Since  it  wil   be  obvious  that  information  technologies  facilitate  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape of Sovereign Individuals from the power of the state, the reaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the col apse of compulsion wil  also include a neo-Luddite attack on</p>
<p class="calibre1">these new technologies and those who use them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7. The nationalist-Luddite reaction wil  not be uniform across regions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">population groups:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a. The reaction wil  be less intense in rapidly growing economies where</p>
<p class="calibre1">per capita income was low during the industrial era, and where the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deepening of markets raises incomes among al  skil  groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">b. Reactionary  sentiments  wil   be  most  intensely  felt  within  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently  rich  countries,  and  especial y  in  communities  with  high</p>
<p class="calibre1">percentages of the value-poor and skil -poor who previously enjoyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">high incomes<a href="#calibre_link-21">.I</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">c. The  Unabomber  notwithstanding,  the  neo-Luddites  wil   attract</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  of  their  adherents  among  those  in  the  bottom  two-thirds  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">298</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-204"></a>earnings capacity within the populations of leading nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">d. The nationalist and Luddite reaction wil  be strongest, however, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">among the very poor but among persons of middling skil s, under-</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievers with credentials, who came of age during the industrial era</p>
<p class="calibre1">and face downward mobility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">8. As  new  megapolitical  conditions  give  rise  to  a  new  consciousness  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity,  along  with  new,  complementary  ideologies  and  morality,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old imperatives of nationalism wil  lose their appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">9. The  nationalist  reaction  wil   peak  in  the  early  decades  of  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium,  then  fade  as  the  e ciency  of  fragmented  sovereignties</p>
<p class="calibre1">proves superior to the massed power of the nation-state. We suspect that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  congenital  bul ying  by  nation-states  of  alternative  jurisdictions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exempli ed by the Russian invasion of Chechnya, wil  tend to deprive</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations and nationalist fanatics of the sympathy of the new generations</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  come  to  maturity  under  the  megapolitical  conditions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">10. The nation-state wil  ultimately col apse in  scal crisis. Systemic crises</p>
<p class="calibre1">typical y arise when failing institutions su er from rising expenses and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal ing income&mdash;a situation that is bound to beset the leading nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states  as  retirement  bene ts  and  medical  outlays  bal oon  early  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty- rst  century.  As  we  write,  both  the  United  Kingdom  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United States are burdened with multitril ion-dol ar unfunded pension</p>
<p class="calibre1">liabilities (comparable on a per capita basis) that neither is likely to tame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other leading nation-states face similarly bankrupting burdens. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PARALLELS WITH THE RENAISSANCE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  previously  outlined  reasons  for  thinking  that  the  col apse  of  the  nanny</p>
<p class="calibre1">state  wil   have  consequences  closely  paral el ing  those  associated  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse  of  the  institutional  monopoly  of  the  Holy  Mother  Church  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries ago. Not unlike the nation-state today, the Church then had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a position of unchal enged predominance for centuries. In some respects, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Church  was  even  more  rmly  established  than  the  state  became  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred years later. The Church had long claimed to act as “the universal</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority at the head of Christian society. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”5 </a>That is the characterization of</p>
<p class="calibre1">299</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-205"></a>medieval  intel ectual  historian  John  B.  Morral .  Yet  while  few  Europeans</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  have  disputed  the  Church’s  claim  to  supremacy  in  Christendom</p>
<p class="calibre1">before the technological revolution of the 1490s, the Church barely survived</p>
<p class="calibre1">in its traditional role for another generation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Privatization of Conscience</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  early  1520s,  mil ions  of  good  Europeans  had  rejected  the  universal</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority of the Catholic Church, a heresy punishable by torture and death</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  a  few  decades  previously.  Indeed,  many  medieval  European  cathedrals</p>
<p class="calibre1">and churches were decorated with instructive carvings of heretics having their</p>
<p class="calibre1">tongues torn out by demons. <a href="#calibre_link-20">6 </a>The lesson these tortures conveyed must have</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed many il iterate parishioners who could have recognized the victims</p>
<p class="calibre1">as heretics simply by their punishment. The iconography was unambiguous:</p>
<p class="calibre1">heretics  were  those  whose  tongues  were  mutilated.  Yet  harsh  as  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">punishment was, it was merely the warm-up for the ultimate punishment for</p>
<p class="calibre1">heresy: death at the stake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  the  Church’s  dismay,  however,  the  lesson  was  not  su ciently</p>
<p class="calibre1">intimidating. The advent of the printing press in ated the supply of heretical</p>
<p class="calibre1">arguments so dramatical y that even the prospect of gruesome punishment</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceased  to  deter  would-be  heretics.  Indeed,  not  a  few  unlucky,  pioneers  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  freedom  in  early  modern  Europe  did  pay  for  their  assertions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual independence by having their tongues cut out. Others were burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  the  stake.  The  agents  of  reaction  in  the  Inquisition  literal y  incinerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  for  uttering  what  we  would  consider  ordinary  expressions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al  told, the Reformation and the reaction it inspired cost mil ions their</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives. Battle eld deaths in the  nal half of the Thirty Years’ War alone totaled</p>
<p class="calibre1">1,151,000. <a href="#calibre_link-20">7 </a>Many more died from famine, disease, and at the hands of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inquisition  and  other  authorities.  By  no  means  al   the  violence  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">perpetrated  by  Catholic  authorities.  The  bones  of  more  than  a  thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading English Catholics thought to have been brutal y murdered by King</p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry VIII have been uncovered at the Tower of London. Some, including</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir  Thomas  More  and  Bishop  St.  John  Fisher,  were  openly  executed  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">refusing  to  abandon  the  old  faith. <a href="#calibre_link-20">8  </a>King  Henry  VIII’s  Catholic  daughter, 300</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-206"></a>Queen  Mary,  on  the  other  hand,  insane  with  syphilis  inherited  from  her</p>
<p class="calibre1">father, incinerated three hundred Protestant heretics at the stake in the last</p>
<p class="calibre1">two  years  of  her  reign.  Such  was  the  price  paid  as  individuals  of  di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">persuasions asserted their religious convictions and the long-denied right to</p>
<p class="calibre1">choose the church they supported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen  from  our  vantage  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions  of  personal  belief  were  wel   within  the  range  that  should  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">protected  by  freedom  of  religion  and  freedom  of  speech.  But  there  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither  freedom  of  religion  nor  freedom  of  speech  in  the  early  sixteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century. The authorities of the day stil  drew their bearings from the waning</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval  worldview.  To  their  eyes  gestures  of  individual  autonomy  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposition to authority, especial y the  <i class="calibre4">plentitude potestatis</i> (ful ness of power)</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  pope  were  outrageous  and  decidedly  subversive.  As  theological</p>
<p class="calibre1">historian Euan Cameron said, religious reformers like Martin Luther adopted</p>
<p class="calibre1">views that “meant a deliberate and decisive break with the institutional and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual continuity of the old Church. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Heresy and Treason</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  that  spirit,  we  anticipate  “a  deliberate  and  decisive  break”  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutional and ideological continuity of the nation-state. By the end of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst  quarter  of  the  next  century,  mil ions  of  upright  individuals  wil   have</p>
<p class="calibre1">committed the secular equivalent of sixteenth-century heresy&mdash;a kind of low</p>
<p class="calibre1">treason. They wil  have withdrawn al egiance from the faltering nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">to assert their own sovereignty, their right to choose not their bishops or their</p>
<p class="calibre1">house  of  worship  but  their  form  of  governance  as  customers.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">privatization of sovereignty wil  paral el the privatization of conscience of  ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries  earlier.  Both  are  the  mass  defection  of  former  supporters  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominant institutions. As Albert O. Hirschman, an expert on “responses to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decline  in  rms,  organizations  and  states,”  has  written,  this  type  of  exit  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">di cult  because  “exit  has  often  been  branded  as   <i class="calibre4">criminal, </i>  for  it  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">label ed desertion, defection and treason. <a href="#calibre_link-20">”10</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign  Individuals  wil   no  longer  merely  accede  to  what  is  imposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon them as human resources of the state. Mil ions wil  shed the obligations</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  citizenship  to  become  customers  for  the  useful  services  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">301</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-27"></a>provide. Indeed, they wil  create and patronize paral el institutions that wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">place  most  of  the  services  associated  with  citizenship  on  an  entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  basis.  For  most  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  productive  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been treated as assets by the state, in much the way that the dairy farmer treats</p>
<p class="calibre1">milk cows. They have been squeezed ever more vigorously. Now the cows wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprout wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Defection from Citizenship</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  new  megapolitical  conditions  undermined  the  monopoly  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church  in  the  sixteenth  century,  we  expect  the  megapolitics  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age to ultimately dictate the terms of governance in the twenty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst century, no matter how outrageous its new terms may seem to those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporate the values of modern politics as their own. The evolution from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the status of “citizen” to that of “customer” entails a betrayal of the past as</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp as the transition from chivalry to citizenship in the early modern era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defection of the information elite from citizenship wil  have a stimulus</p>
<p class="calibre1">much like that which led mil ions of Europeans  ve hundred years earlier to</p>
<p class="calibre1">renounce the infal ibility of the pope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the paral el with the Reformation is not compel ing, it may be partly</p>
<p class="calibre1">because  it  is  not  immediately  evident  today  that  renunciation  of  loyalty  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  institutions  was  ever  the  big  deal  that  treason  became  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century. Outside of a few Islamic countries, heresy at the end of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century  is  a  spiritual  misdemeanor,  no  more  shattering  to  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual’s reputation than a speeding ticket for driving forty- ve in a thirty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">mile zone. <a href="#calibre_link-21">II</a> Indeed, it is not uncommon in Europe and North America to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nd clergy and even bishops who do not believe in God or deny crucial tenets</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the faith they espouse. Today, a heresy would almost need to be blatant</p>
<p class="calibre1">devil worship to be noticeable. In most Western countries, religious doctrines</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  so  il -formed  and  sloppily  held  that  few  persons  can  identify  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theological points that were the focus of controversy of heresies in the past. <a href="#calibre_link-20">11</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This re ects the general shift of attention away from religion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  some  extent,  religious  leaders  have  actual y  helped  to  lead  the  late-</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth-century  defection  from  seriousness  about  spiritual  issues  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">de ecting  their  energies  away  from  spiritual  preoccupations  to  become</p>
<p class="calibre1">302</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-360"></a>lobbyists and social agitators. Drawn like loose  lings to the magnet of power, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they devote much of their activities to pressuring political leaders to adopt</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistributive  policies  crucial  to  the  nationalist  bargain.  Witness  the  loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">e orts of the Catholic Church in Argentina to pressure the government of</p>
<p class="calibre1">President  Carlos  Menem  to  abandon  economic  reforms  in  favor  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventional  in ationary  monetary  and  Keynesian  scal  policies.  Similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaints have been lodged by religious leaders against e orts to restructure</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloated budgets in New Zealand and many other countries. Catholic bishops</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobbied vigorously against the reform of welfare in the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">A Fiscal Inquisition? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply  put,  contemporary  religious  leaders  focus  much  of  their  declining</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral  authority  on  secular  redemption  and  agitation  to  in uence  the  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than on spiritual salvation. Given this record, they can be expected to</p>
<p class="calibre1">participate  as  accomplices  in  the  reaction  against  the  coming  secular</p>
<p class="calibre1">reformation. As the nation-state is chal enged and begins to wobble, it wil  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be able to ful l  the promises of material bene ts that are central to</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular  support.  The  de  facto  bargain  struck  at  the  time  of  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution wil  lapse. The state wil  no longer be capable of guaranteeing its</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens  low-cost  or  free  schooling,  much  less  medical  care,  unemployment</p>
<p class="calibre1">insurance,  and  pensions  in  exchange  for  otherwise  poorly  paid  military</p>
<p class="calibre1">service. While the changing requirements of warfare wil  enable governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">to defend themselves and territories under their dominion without  elding</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass armies, this wil  hardly relieve governments of the criticism for breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">what has become an anachronistic bargain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  as  the  new  megapolitical  logic  takes  hold,  its  consequences  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove wildly unpopular with the losers in the new information economy. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore al  but certain that many religious leaders, along with the primary</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ciaries of government spending, wil  be at the forefront of a nostalgic</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaction seeking to reassert the claims of nationalism. They wil  claim that no</p>
<p class="calibre1">American, Frenchman, Canadian, or other nationality&mdash; l  in the blank &mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be al owed to go to bed hungry. Even countries that have been at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forefront  of  reform  and  stand  to  bene t  disproportionately  from  “market-</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendly  globalism,”  like  New  Zealand,  wil   be  tormented  by  reactionary</p>
<p class="calibre1">303</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-496"></a>losers. They wil  seek to thwart the movement of capital and people across</p>
<p class="calibre1">borders.  And  they  wil   not  stop  there.  Demagogues,  like  Winston  Peters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leader of the New Zealand First Party, are too lazy to think original y about</p>
<p class="calibre1">how the new world wil  function. But, in due course, Winston and his crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  be tipped o  to the logic of the information economy. They wil  seek to</p>
<p class="calibre1">halt  the  di usion  of  computers,  robotics,  telecommunications,  encryption, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and other Information Age technologies that are facilitating the displacement</p>
<p class="calibre1">of workers in almost every sector of the global economy. Wherever you turn, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there  are  politicians  who  wil   gladly  thwart  the  prospects  for  long-term</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperity just to prevent individuals from declaring their independence of</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">20/20 Vision</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">By  2020,  or  roughly  ve  centuries  after  Martin  Luther  nailed  his  95</p>
<p class="calibre1">subversive  theses  on  the  church  door  at  Wittenberg,  the  perception  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost-bene t  ratios  of  citizenship  wil   have  undergone  a  similar  subversive</p>
<p class="calibre1">clari cation.  The  vision  of  the  nation-state  among  persons  of  ability  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth,  the  Sovereign  Individuals  of  the  future,  wil   have  undergone  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  equivalent  of  laser  surgery.  They  wil   be  seeing  20/20.  In  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century, as throughout the modern era, persistently high returns to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence  made  big  government  a  paying  proposition.  The  decisiveness  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">massed  power  mobilized  the  al egiance  of  the  wealthy  and  ambitious  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">OECD  nation-states,  notwithstanding  predatory  taxes  imposed  on  income</p>
<p class="calibre1">and capital. Politicians were able to impose marginal tax rates approaching or</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeding  90  percent  in  every  OECD  country  in  the  decade  immediately</p>
<p class="calibre1">fol owing World War II. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  we  have  explored,  the  rich  had  little  choice  but  to  accede  to  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">impositions.  Circumstances  obliged  them  to  rely  for  protection  upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments that could master violence on a large scale. It rarely mattered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except  perhaps  to  British  policemen  with  the  chance  to  take  a  posting  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hong Kong, that OECD governments imposed monopolistic taxes. Anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  high  earnings  capacity  who  wished  to  enjoy  leading-edge  economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity during the Industrial Age usual y had little option but to reside</p>
<p class="calibre1">304</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-207"></a>in  a  high-tax  economy.  This  meant  shouldering  a  tax  burden  out  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">proportion to services rendered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Arithmetic of Politics</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nineteenth-century  American  Vice  President  John  C.  Calhoun  shrewdly</p>
<p class="calibre1">sketched  the  arithmetic  of  modern  politics.  Calhoun’s  formula  divides  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire  population  of  the  nation-state  into  two  classes:   <i class="calibre4">taxpayers, </i>  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">contribute more to the cost of government services than they consume; and</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">tax  consumers, </i>  who  receive  bene ts  from  government  in  excess  of  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">contribution to the cost. With a few conspicuous exceptions, most OECD</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs  were  net  taxpayers  to  an  exaggerated  extent  as  the  twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  wound  down.  For  example,  in  1996,  the  top  1  percent  of  British</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxpayers shouldered 17 percent of the total income tax burden. They paid 30</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent more than the bottom 50 percent of earners, who contributed just 13</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of income tax payments. In the United States, the rich shouldered an</p>
<p class="calibre1">even more exaggerated burden, with the top 1 percent paying 30.2 percent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the total income tax receipts in 1995<a href="#calibre_link-20">.12</a> Not only were the rich obliged to pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  service  that,  as  Frederic  C.  Lane  reminds  us,  “was  of  poor  quality  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">outrageously overpriced,” but their payments were often not proportionate</p>
<p class="calibre1">to any service whatever<a href="#calibre_link-20">.13</a> The bene ts for which the top taxpayers paid often</p>
<p class="calibre1">went entirely to others. In most cases, the rich were glad to under-consume</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  services,  which  were  typical y  of  low  quality.  Government</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaus  in  almost  every  country  were  famously  ine cient,  largely  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  tended  to  be  control ed  by  employees  who  lacked  an  incentive  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve productivity. By practical y any measure, the largest taxpayers during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the industrial era paid many times more for government services than they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be worth in a competitive market. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  hardly  went  unnoted.  Unhappily,  however,  the  recognition  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">payments to government for protection were, in Lane’s words, “wasteful by</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideal  standards”  was  seldom  an  actionable  insight  in  the  middle  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century.  Rather  it  was  simply  a  defect  to  be  accepted,  “one  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">various kinds of waste built into social organization.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">14</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  alternative  for  the  discontented  was  not  to  move  from  Britain  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">France,  for  example,  or  from  the  United  States  to  Canada.  Except  in  rare</p>
<p class="calibre1">305</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>circumstances,  that  would  have  availed  little.  The  leading  nation-states  al su ered from the same drawback. They al  adopted more or less con scatory</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax regimes. To realize a signi cant increase in autonomy one had to escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">the core countries of Europe and North America altogether and head for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">periphery.  Tax  burdens  were  meaningful y  lower  in  parts  of  Asia,  South</p>
<p class="calibre1">America, and on various remote islands. But there was usual y a price to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">paid for escaping predatory taxation&mdash;a loss of economic opportunity and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">often, a decline in living standards. As we have explored, in the conditions of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Industrial  Age,  economic  opportunity  was  constrained  and  living</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards were subpar in most of the jurisdictions outside the core industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states that indulged in con scatory taxation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the Communist systems as a paradigm. Along with many Third</p>
<p class="calibre1">World regimes, they typical y did not impose high income taxes&mdash;or even any</p>
<p class="calibre1">at al <a href="#calibre_link-21">.III</a> Nonetheless, during the three-quarters of a century the Soviet Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">existed, few, if any, entrepreneurs sought tax refuge there. While the Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">income  tax  rates  were  not  high,  they  a orded  no  advantage  because  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soviets  made  a  virtue  of  their  refusal  to  recognize  property  rights.  This</p>
<p class="calibre1">imposed an even worse burden than taxation. The Communist systems made</p>
<p class="calibre1">it al  but impossible to organize a business and make any serious money. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ect, the Communist state con scated pretax income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, had anyone already possessing a secure income for some eccentric</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason chosen to live in Moscow or Havana, he would have been hard-pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to use money to purchase a decent standard of living. Outside of access to</p>
<p class="calibre1">good  cigars,  caviar,  excel ent  orchestras,  and  the  bal et,  life  in  the  former</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communist  systems  a orded  few  consumer  pleasures.  Most  of  the  scarce</p>
<p class="calibre1">good things of life were unavailable or were tightly rationed on the basis of</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  in uence  rather  than  open  exchange.  At  the  risk  of  validating  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stereotype of critics of postmodern life who emphasize “the importance of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consumption  in  the  postmodern  experience,”  the  rising  standard  of  goods</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  services  available  worldwide  since  the  fal   of  Communism  has  surely</p>
<p class="calibre1">made  competition  between  jurisdictions  more  lively,  thereby  helping  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaken ties to nation and place. <a href="#calibre_link-22">15</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the old regime, consumer choices were so limited that even Castro</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself would have been hard-pressed to secure a packet of decent dental  oss</p>
<p class="calibre1">had he wanted to clean cohiba fragments from his teeth. Until recently, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">306</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-208"></a>even the rich in many parts of the globe could enjoy the quality of life that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  common  among  the  middle  classes  in  Western  Europe  or  North</p>
<p class="calibre1">America.  Faced  with  this  doleful  situation,  most  persons  of  outstanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent were moved to accept the nationalist bargain during the Industrial Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stayed put and paid outrageously high taxes for the doubtful protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">o ered  by  the  particular  nation-state  that  monopolized  violence  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory in which they were born. </p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;HEINRICH VON KLEIST</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fal  of Communism removed an “Iron Curtain” that had impaired</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel and e ectively blocked the globalization of commerce, thereby keeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world  arti cial y  “large.”  The  jet  plane,  in  combination  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  technologies  that  undermined  Communism,  increased</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition for high-end travel dol ars. The parade of bankers trooping in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out of even the most remote provinces was a prodigious stimulus to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">standard  of  accommodation  and  cuisine  worldwide.  By  this,  we  are  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">referring  to  the  spread  of  McDonald’s  hamburgers  and  Kentucky  Fried</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicken franchises, in even such formerly forbidding venues as Moscow and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bucharest. Less noticed, but more important, has been the spread of leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel chains, and high-quality sit-down restaurants serving grand cru clarets</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than vodka and Coke. Thanks to this transformation, anyone who can</p>
<p class="calibre1">a ord it can now enjoy a high material standard of life almost anywhere on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the planet. Indeed, it is now a rare country where there is not a  rst-class hotel</p>
<p class="calibre1">and at least one restaurant that would interest a Michelin inspector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Hirschman  anticipated  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago,  technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">advance  has  signi cantly  increased  the  appeal  of  exit  as  a  solution  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsatisfactory provision and pricing of services. He wrote: “Loyalty to one’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">country,  on  the  other  hand,  is  something  we  could  do  without.…  Only  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries  start  to  resemble  each  other  because  of  the  advances  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications and al -around modernization wil  the danger of premature</p>
<p class="calibre1">and excessive exits arise, the ‘brain drain’ being a current example.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">16 </a>Note as we pointed out in chapter 8 that Hirschman’s standard of “premature and</p>
<p class="calibre1">307</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-417"></a>excessive exits” is seen from the perspective of the nation-state being deserted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not from the perspective of the individual seeking a better life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless,  his  conclusion  that  similarities  between  countries  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase the attraction of defection and exit is unimpeachable. The fact that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is now easier to live wel  anywhere makes living where the cost is least onerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">appealing.  Yet  more  important  than  the  fact  that  you  can  live  wel   almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere is the fact that you can now earn a high income anywhere. It is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer necessary to reside in a high-cost jurisdiction in order to accumulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">su cient wealth to live, as Lord Keynes advised, “wisely, agreeably and wel .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  reasons  we  have  already  explored,  microtechnology  changes  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">underlying  megapolitical  foundation  upon  which  the  nation-state  rests.  In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age, a new cybereconomy wil  emerge beyond the capacity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of any government to monopolize. For the  rst time, technology wil  enable</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals to accumulate wealth in a realm that cannot be bent easily to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands of systematic compulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The new society, and therefore the new culture, wil  be de ned at one end</p>
<p class="calibre1">by what machines can do better than people, by automation that wil  do away</p>
<p class="calibre1">with increasing numbers of low-skil  tasks, and at the other by the power that</p>
<p class="calibre1">information technology gives to people who actual y have the talent to take</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage of it. Such a society wil  have greater tensions between a smal  class, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who might be termed the information aristocracy, and a growing underclass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who might be termed the information poor. One of the di erences between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them wil  be that the information poor wil  either be tied by geography or wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">nd  little  bene t  from  moving.  The  information  aristocracy,  as  we  discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1">elsewhere, wil  be extremely mobile, since they wil  be able to earn money in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any locale that is attractive to them, just as popular novelists have always been</p>
<p class="calibre1">able to do. Robert Louis Stevenson could earn his living on an island in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paci c a hundred years ago; now the information aristocracy can al  do the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Market Competition Between Jurisdictions</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  information  technology  transcends  the  tyranny  of  place,  it  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">automatical y expose jurisdictions everywhere to  <i class="calibre4">de facto</i> global competition</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the basis of quality and price. In other words, governments exercising local</p>
<p class="calibre1">308</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>territorial monopolies, like most other entities,  nal y wil  be subject to real</p>
<p class="calibre1">market competition on the basis of how wel  they serve their customers. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  soon make it unavoidably obvious that the old logic that favored high-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost  regimes  in  the  industrial  era  has  reversed.  Leading  nation-states,  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">their predatory, redistributive tax regimes and heavy-handed regulations, wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  longer  be  jurisdictions  of  choice.  Seen  dispassionately,  they  o er  poor-</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality  protection  and  diminished  economic  opportunity  at  monopoly</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices. In the years to come, they may prove to be more social y unreceptive</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  violent  than  other  regions  such  as  Latin  America  where  incomes  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional y  been  more  unequal.  The  leading  welfare  states  wil   lose  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">most talented citizens through desertion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The “Extranational” Age Ahead</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  era  of  the  “Sovereign  Individual”  takes  shape,  many  of  the  ablest</p>
<p class="calibre1">people wil  cease to think of themselves as party to a nation, as “British” or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“American”  or  “Canadian.”’  A  new  “transnational”  or  “extranational” </p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding  of  the  world  and  a  new  way  of  identifying  one’s  place  in  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">await discovery in the new mil ennium. As indicated before, early evidence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  emerging  mind-set  was  provided  in  the  nding  that  almost  half  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">teenaged viewers of MTV expect to leave the country of their birth in order</p>
<p class="calibre1">to achieve the life they want for themselves. This new equation of identity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unlike nationality, wil  not be a product of the systematic compulsion that</p>
<p class="calibre1">made nation-states and the state system universal in the twentieth century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mere  fact  that  developments  embracing  the  whole  globe  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly  described  as  “international”  shows  how  deeply  the  nationalist</p>
<p class="calibre1">paradigm  has  penetrated  into  our  way  of  conceiving  the  world.  After  two</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries of indoctrination in the mysteries of “international relations” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“international  law,”  it  is  easy  to  overlook  that  “international”  is  not  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">longstanding Western concept. In fact, the word  <i class="calibre4">international</i> was invented</p>
<p class="calibre1">by Jeremy Bentham in 1789. It was  rst used in his book  <i class="calibre4">An Introduction to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the  Principles  of  Morals  and  Legislation. </i>  Bentham  wrote,  “The  word</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">international</i>  it  must  be  acknowledged,  is  a  new  one,  though  it  is  hoped</p>
<p class="calibre1">su ciently analogous and intel igible.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">17</a> The word caught on, but not just in</p>
<p class="calibre1">309</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-325"></a>the narrow sense that Bentham intended.  <i class="calibre4">“International” </i> came to be a sloppy synonym for anything that happens across the globe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  International  Age  began  in  1789,  the  same  year  as  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution. It lasted for two centuries, until 1989, when the revolt against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communism  in  Europe  began.  We  believe  that  that  second  revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked  the  end  of  the  International  Age,  and  not  merely  because  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">discredited  Communist  anthem  was  “The  International.”  The  command</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy  with  state  ownership  was  the  most  ambitious  expression  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state. The close relationship between state power and nationalism was</p>
<p class="calibre1">re ected in language. The most aggressive verb of the Modern Age was “to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalize,” meaning to bring under state ownership and control. It was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">word that tripped easily o  the tongues of demagogues in most parts of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">globe during the International Age. Now it is part of the vocabulary of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past. Nationalization has become anachronistic, precisely because state power</p>
<p class="calibre1">has become anachronistic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the twilight of the modern era, the concentrated power of the state was</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermined by the interaction between technological innovation and market</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces. Now the next stage in the triumph of the market is about to unfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only wil  individual nation-states begin to dissolve, but in our view even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the club for nation-states, the United Nations, is destined to go bankrupt. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  not  be  surprised  to  see  the  UN  liquidated  sometime  soon  after  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn of the mil ennium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  “international”  were  a  stock,  now  would  be  the  time  to  sel .  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">concept is likely to be supplanted in the new mil ennium, or at least narrowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to its original meaning for the compel ing reason that the whole world wil  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be dominated by a system of interrelating sovereign nations. Relations</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   take  on  the  novel  “extranational”  forms  dictated  by  the  growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  microjurisdictions  and  Sovereign  Individuals.  A  dispute</p>
<p class="calibre1">between an enclave on the coast of Labrador and a Sovereign Individual wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">not rightly be described as an “international” dispute. It wil  be extranational. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Indeed, when the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen” was</p>
<p class="calibre1">published in the Parisian style, it was unintel igible to a majority living within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  current  borders  of  France. <a href="#calibre_link-22">23  </a>One  of  the  chal enges  the  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolutionaries  faced  was  calculating  how  to  translate  their  broadsides  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">intel igible to one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people living within what became “France” had quite di erent ways</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  speaking  that  were  consciously  con ated  into  one  o cial  language  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter of policy. Written French had been the o cial language of the courts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of justice since François I issued the Edict of Vil ers-Cotterêts in 1539. <a href="#calibre_link-22">24</a> But this did not mean that it was widely intel igible, any more than “law French” </p>
<p class="calibre1">was  widely  intel igible  in  England  after  1200,  when  it  became  the  o cial</p>
<p class="calibre1">language  of  the  courts  of  justice.  Each  was  an  “administrative  vernacular,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">not a standardized language spoken and understood throughout the territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  French  revolutionaries  wanted  to  create  something  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehensive,  a  national  language.  Historian  Janis  Langins  comments  in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Social History of Language</i> that “an in uential body of opinion among</p>
<p class="calibre1">the revolutionists believed that the triumph of the Revolution and the spread</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  enlightenment  would  be  furthered  by  a  conscious  e ort  to  impose  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">standard French in the territory of the Republic.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">25</a> This “conscious e ort” </p>
<p class="calibre1">313</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-213"></a>included a good deal of fussing over the use of individual words. Consider the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tel ing  example  of  the  adjective  “revolutionary,”  rst  used  by  Mirabeau  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1789. After a period of “somewhat wide and indiscriminant use,” as Langins</p>
<p class="calibre1">puts  it,  “during  the  Terror  there  fol owed  a  period  of  suppression  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">oblivion for several decades.… On June 12, 1795, the Convention decided to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reform the language as wel  as the institutions created by our former tyrants</p>
<p class="calibre1">[i.e., the vanquished Robespierrists] in replacing the word ‘revolutionary’ in</p>
<p class="calibre1">o cial designations. <a href="#calibre_link-22">”26 </a>This tradition of language engineering survives in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nicky reception of the French authorities to words like “weekend” that have</p>
<p class="calibre1">made their way into French from English. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two  centuries  ago,  however,  the  national  language  engineers  in  France</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  discriminating  merely  against  words  from  across  the  English</p>
<p class="calibre1">Channel;  they  faced  a  much  bigger  job  eradicating  local  variants  of  speech</p>
<p class="calibre1">within the territory of the republic. This exercise was not merely con ned to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppressing   <i class="calibre4">la  langue  d’oc. </i>  The  “French”  spoken  on  the  Riviera  then  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer  to  the  “Italian”  spoken  farther  to  the  east  than  to  Parisian  French. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equal y,  the  language  of  Alsace  could  arguably  have  been  categorized  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">form  of  German,  which  itself  had  numerous  local  varieties.  Basque  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken  in  the  Pyrenees.  Like  Breton,  spoken  along  the  northwest  coast  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">France, Basque had little in common with any of the vernacular “dialects” of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin that were the basis of “French.” There were also substantial numbers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flemish speakers in the northeast. “The Parisian style of speech,” as Michael</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bil ig reminds us, was not spread through spontaneous market processes, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">“imposed, legal y and cultural y, as ‘French.’ <a href="#calibre_link-22">”27</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">What was true in France has been true elsewhere in the building of nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states.  Languages  were  often  carried  by  armies  and  imposed  by  colonial</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers.  For  example,  the  map  of  Africa  after  independence  was  de ned</p>
<p class="calibre1">according  to  the  areas  where  the  administrative  languages  of  European</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers  predominated.  Local  dialects  were  seldom  taught  in  schools.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctions  between  recognized  “languages,”  which  tended  to  de ne</p>
<p class="calibre1">“nations,” even nations with arbitrary colonial borders, and “dialects,” which</p>
<p class="calibre1">did not, were in large measure political. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  short,  the  imposition  of  a  “national  language”  was  part  of  a  process</p>
<p class="calibre1">used worldwide to enhance the power of the state. Encouraging or obliging</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone within the territory where the state monopolized violence to speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">314</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-214"></a>“the  mother  tongue”  conveyed  signi cant  advantages  in  facilitating  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Military Dimension of Language Uniformity</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In a world where returns to violence were rising, the adoption of a national</p>
<p class="calibre1">language  conveyed  military  advantages.  A  national  language  was  almost  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">precondition  to  consolidation  of  central  power  in  nation-states.  Central</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities  that  encouraged  their  citizens  to  speak  the  same  tongue  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">better  able  to  weaken  the  military  power  of  local  magnates.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">standardization of language after the French Revolution made the cheapest</p>
<p class="calibre1">and most e ective form of modern military force&mdash;national conscript armies</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;feasible.  A  common  language  enabled  troops  from  al   regions  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“nation” to communicate  uently with one another. This was a prerequisite</p>
<p class="calibre1">before  massed  conscript  armies  could  displace  independent  battalions</p>
<p class="calibre1">mustered and control ed not by the central authorities but by powerful local</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior to the French Revolution, as we discussed in Chapter 5, troops were</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised and commanded by local potentates who might or might not answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">cal s to battle issued from Paris or another capital. In either event, their stance</p>
<p class="calibre1">was determined after careful negotiation. As Charles Til y notes, the “ability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  give  or  withhold  support  a orded…  great  bargaining  power.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">28</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, independent military units had the additional drawback, as far</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  the  central  authorities  were  concerned  of  being  capable  of  resisting</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  e orts  to  commandeer  domestic  resources.  Clearly,  central</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities,  whether  King  or  Revolutionary  Convention,  had  a  di cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">chal enge to col ect taxes or otherwise strip resources from local potentates</p>
<p class="calibre1">who commanded private armies capable of defending those assets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“National armies” greatly enhanced the power of the national government</p>
<p class="calibre1">to impose its wil  throughout a territory. Imposition of a national language</p>
<p class="calibre1">played a decided role in facilitating the formation of national armies. Before</p>
<p class="calibre1">national armies could form and function e ectively it was obviously useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">that their various members be able to communicate  uently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  therefore  a  military  plus  if  everyone  within  a  jurisdiction  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehend  orders  and  instructions,  as  wel   as  convey  certain  intel igence</p>
<p class="calibre1">315</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-215"></a>back along the bureaucratic chain of command. The French revolutionaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrated the value of this almost immediately. In addition to running</p>
<p class="calibre1">the equivalent of a language school, they also set up special monthlong “crash</p>
<p class="calibre1">courses”  in  which,  as  Langins  writes,  “hundreds  of  students  from  al   over</p>
<p class="calibre1">France  would  be  trained  in  the  techniques  of  gunpowder  and  cannon</p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacture.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">29</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  military  advantage  of  the  French  approach  was  shown  by  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">successes in the Napoleonic period, as wel  as by contrary examples of what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened to regimes that could not depend upon the mobilization bene ts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a common tongue during war. One of many factors that contributed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the disastrous defeats and demoralization of the Russian forces in the early</p>
<p class="calibre1">days  of  World  War  I  was  the  fact  that  the  czar’s  aristocratic  o cer  corps</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended  to  communicate  in  German  (the  other  court  language  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Romanovs was French), which the rank-and- le troops, not to mention the</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenry, did not understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  points  to  another  important  military  advantage  of  a  common</p>
<p class="calibre1">language. It reduces the motivational hurdles to  ghting a war. Propaganda is</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless if incomprehensible. In this respect as wel , the French revolutionaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">were also wel  attuned to the possibilities. Their “dominant idea,” according</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  Langins,  was  “the  wil   of  the  people.…  They  therefore  had  to  identify</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  with  the  popular  wil   by   <i class="calibre4">expressing</i>  it  in  its  own  particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">language.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">30 </a>Prior to 1789, mutual incomprehensibility among “citizens” was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  drawback  in  expressing  the  “wil   of  the  people”  and  thus  a  check  on  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise of power at the national level. In more ways than one, multilingual</p>
<p class="calibre1">states  and  empires  faced  higher  obstacles  in  mobilizing  for  war  during  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the margin, therefore, they tended to be supplanted by nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">that were better able to motivate their citizens to  ght and mobilize resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">for war. This is exempli ed by nationalist consolidation, such as the invention</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  France  and  the  French  at  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century.  It  is  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">il ustrated  by  cases  of  nationalist  devolution,  such  as  the  col apse  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Austro-Hungarian  Empire  after  World  War  I.  The  new  nation-states  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged  in  the  wake  of  the  Hapsburg  Empire&mdash;Austria,  Hungary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Czechoslovakia,  and  Yugoslavia&mdash;were,  as  Keynes  said,  “incomplete  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immature.”  Yet  their  claims  to  form  independent  nation-states  grouped</p>
<p class="calibre1">316</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-216"></a>around  national  identities  at  least  partly  de ned  by  language  persuaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">Woodrow  Wilson  and  other  Al ied  leaders  drawing  up  the  Treaty  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Versail es. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  carving  up  of  Central  Europe  after  World  War  I  il ustrates  what  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">double-edged  sword  language  became  in  state-building.  When  returns  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence were rising, a common tongue facilitated the exercise of power and</p>
<p class="calibre1">consolidated  jurisdictions.  However,  when  incentives  to  consolidate  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaker, factions formed by minorities around language disputes also tended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to fracture multilingual states. The surge of separatist sentiment in the cities</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  Austro-Hungarian  Empire  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  fol owed</p>
<p class="calibre1">epidemics  that  devastated  the  German-speaking  populations.  Prague  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">German-speaking city when the nineteenth century opened. Like other cities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it grew rapidly as the century unfolded, mostly by migration, as vast numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of landless Czech-speaking peasants were assimilated from the countryside. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the beginning, the newcomers found it necessary to learn German in order to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get  along,  so  they  did.  But  when  famine  and  disease  carried  away  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers  of  German-speaking  urban  residents  in  midcentury,  they  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">replaced  by  Czech-speaking  peasants.  Suddenly  there  were  so  many  Czech</p>
<p class="calibre1">speakers that it was no longer essential for the new residents to learn German. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prague became a Czech-speaking city and a hotbed of Czech nationalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary  separatist  movements  now  frequently  form  around</p>
<p class="calibre1">language  disputes  in  multilingual  countries.  This  is  evidently  the  case  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Belgium and Canada, two nations that, as we noted earlier, wil  probably be</p>
<p class="calibre1">among  the  rst  in  the  OECD  to  dissolve  in  the  new  mil ennium.  Few</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  can  top  the  heavy-handed  actions  to  enforce  language</p>
<p class="calibre1">uniformity imposed by the Parti Québecois in Quebec. <a href="#calibre_link-22">31</a> More surprisingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">language grievances also played a role in launching the early activities of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">northern  separatists  in  Italy,  which  also  faces  disintegration.  In  the  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">1980s, the Lombard League, as it was then known, “declared Lombardian to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  a  separate  language  from  Italian.”  Bil ig  comments,  “Had  the  League’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">programme  been  successful  during  the  early  1980s,  and  had  Lombardy</p>
<p class="calibre1">seceded from Italy, establishing its own state boundaries, a prediction might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  made:  increasingly  Lombardian  would  have  come  to  be  recognized  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent from Italian.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">32</a> This is not an arbitrary assertion. It re ects what has happened in similar cases. For example, after Norway became independent in</p>
<p class="calibre1">317</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-217"></a>1905,  Norwegian  nationalists  set  about  a  concerted  e ort  to  identify  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">underline  features  of  the  “Norwegian  language”  that  were  distinct  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Danish  and  Swedish.  Similarly,  activists  favoring  an  independent  Belarus</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed road signs into “Belarusian,” but apparently failed to make the point</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Belarusian is a separate language rather than a dialect of Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  that  the  military  imperatives  favoring  language  uniformity  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">largely been outstripped, we expect the national languages to fade, but not</p>
<p class="calibre1">without a  ght. It is to be expected that the wel -rehearsed adage that “war is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  health  of  the  state”  wil   be  tested  as  a  recuperative.  As  the  nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">slides  into  irrelevancy,  demagogues  and  reactionaries  wil   foment  wars  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">con icts,  along  the  lines  of  ethnic  and  tribal  ghting  that  has  racked  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">former  Yugoslavia  and  numerous  jurisdictions  in  Africa,  from  Burundi  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somalia.  Con icts  wil   prove  convenient  for  the  pretexts  they  provide  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  seeking  to  arrest  the  trend  toward  commercialization  of  sovereignty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wars wil  facilitate e orts to sustain more exacting regimes of taxation and</p>
<p class="calibre1">impose  more  severe  penalties  for  escaping  the  duties  and  burdens  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship.  Wars  wil   help  undergird  the  “them,  and  us”  dimension  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalism.  To  the  proponents  of  systematic  coercion,  commercialized</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty,  which  gives  individuals  a  choice  of  sovereignty  services  based</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon  price  and  quality,  wil   seem  no  less  a  sin  than  the  assertion  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals of the right to veto the judgments of the pope and choose their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own path to salvation during the Reformation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The paral el is underscored by the fact that both the new technology of</p>
<p class="calibre1">printing  at  the  end  of  the  fteenth  century  and  the  new  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology at the end of the twentieth place formerly occult knowledge at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disposal  of  individuals  in  a  liberating  way.  The  printing  press  brought  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scriptures and other holy texts directly within the reach of individuals who</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously had to rely upon priests and the church hierarchy to interpret the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Word of God. The new information technology brings within the reach of</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone with a computer hook-up information about commerce, investment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  current  events  that  previously  was  available  only  to  persons  at  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Make no mistake, the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  destructive  to  nationalism  as  the  advent  of  gunpowder  and  the  printing</p>
<p class="calibre1">press  was  conducive  to  nationalism.  Global  computer  links  wil   not  bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">back Latin as a universal language, but they wil  help shift commerce out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">local  dialects,  like  French  in  Quebec,  into  the  new  global  language  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Internet  and  World  Wide  Web&mdash;the  language  that  Otis  Redding  and  Tina</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner taught the world, the language of rock and rol , English. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These new media wil  undercut nationalism by creating new a nities that</p>
<p class="calibre1">supersede  geographic  boundaries.  They  wil   appeal  to  widely  dispersed</p>
<p class="calibre1">audiences that form wherever educated persons happen to  nd themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These new nonterritorial a nities wil   ourish, and in so doing help to create</p>
<p class="calibre1">a new focus for “patriotism.” Or rather, they wil  form new “ingroups” with</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom individuals can identify without necessarily sacri cing their economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">rationality. The history of the Jews during the past two thousand years shows</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  this  is  possible  over  the  long  term  and  in  the  face  of  hostile  local</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions. As the comment from Wil iam Pfa  quoted at the head of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapter suggests, it is ahistorical and wrong to think that loyalties to the land</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  one’s  fathers,  the   <i class="calibre4">patria, </i>  necessarily  entails  loyalty  to  an  institution</p>
<p class="calibre1">resembling  a  nation-state.  Geo rey  Parker  and  Lesley  M.  Smith  make  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  more  clear  in   <i class="calibre4">The  General  Crisis  of  the  Seventeenth  Century, </i>  showing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that what appear to be examples of early modern nationalism are more often</p>
<p class="calibre1">instances of patriots defending a much narrower  <i class="calibre4">patria</i> &mdash;often against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">encroachment of a state. They write, “Al  too often a supposed al egiance to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">national community turns out, on inspection, to be nothing of the kind. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">patria</i> itself is at least as likely to be a home town or province as the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">34</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As Jack Weatherford lucidly explains in  <i class="calibre4">Savages and Civilization, </i> the rise</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  printing  press,  the  rst  mass-production  technology,  had  dramatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ects  in  contributing  to  the  creation  of  politics,  with  its  demands  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">al egiance  to  a  broader  nation-state.  By  the  year  1500,  there  were  printing</p>
<p class="calibre1">presses operating in 236 places in Europe. “and they had printed a combined</p>
<p class="calibre1">total  of  some  20  mil ion  books.” <a href="#calibre_link-22">35</a>  Gutenberg’s  rst  printed  book  was  an 319</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-219"></a>edition of the Bible in Latin. He fol owed it with editions of other popular</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval books in Latin. As Weatherford explains, printing meandered in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction that defeated early expectations that the ready availability of texts</p>
<p class="calibre1">would spread the use of Latin and even Greek. To the contrary. There were</p>
<p class="calibre1">two  important  reasons  why  the  printing  press  did  not  reinforce  the  use  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin.  First,  the  printing  press  was  a  mass-production  technology.  As</p>
<p class="calibre1">Benedict Anderson points out, “[I]f manuscript knowledge was scarce and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arcane lore, print knowledge lived by reproducibility and dissemination.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">36</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Very few Europeans were multilingual in 1500. This meant that the audience</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  works  in  Latin  was  not  a  mass  audience.  The  vast  majority  who  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">monoglot made up a much bigger market of potential readers. Furthermore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what  was  true  of  readers  was  even  more  true  of  writers.  Publishers  needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">products to sel . Because there were few contemporary  fteenth- or sixteenth-</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  authors  who  could  compose  satisfactory  new  works  in  Latin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">publishers  were  driven  by  market  necessity  to  publish  works  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vernacular.  Printing  thus  helped  to  di erentiate  Europe  into  linguistic</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsets. This was encouraged not only by the publication of new works that</p>
<p class="calibre1">established the identity of new languages, like Spanish and Italian, but also by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the adoption of characteristic typefaces, such as Roman, Italic, and the heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gothic  script  that  was  common  to  German  publishing  until  wel   into  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century. The new vernacular publishing, what Anderson describes</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  “print  capitalism,”  was  very  successful.  Most  notably,  the  printing  press</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave heresy the kind of decisive boost that we expect for the denationalization</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the individual from the Internet. In particular, Luther became “the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">best-sel ing author so known. Or to put it another way, the  rst writer who</p>
<p class="calibre1">could ‘sel ’ his new books on the basis of his name.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">37 </a>Astonishingly, Luther’s works accounted for “no less than one third of  <i class="calibre4">all</i> German-language books</p>
<p class="calibre1">sold between 1518 and 1525.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">38</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In many respects, the new technology of the Information Age wil  counter</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of the megapolitical impact of  fteenth-century technology, the printing</p>
<p class="calibre1">press, in stimulating and underpinning the rise of nation-states. The World</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wide Web creates a commercial venue with a global language, English. It wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventual y  be  reinforced  with  simultaneous-translation  software,  making</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost  everyone  e ectively  multilingual,  and  helping  to  denationalize</p>
<p class="calibre1">language  and  imagination.  Just  as  the  technology  of  the  printing  press</p>
<p class="calibre1">320</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-220"></a>undermined al egiance to the dominant institution of the Middle Ages, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy Mother Church, so we expect the new communications technology of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age to undermine the authority of the nanny state. In due</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, almost every area wil  become multilingual. Local dialects wil  rise in</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance. Propaganda from the center wil  lose much of its coherence as</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants  and  speakers  of  minority  tongues  are  emboldened  to  resist</p>
<p class="calibre1">assimilation into the nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MILITARY MYSTICISM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Far from being objective communities, in the same sense that, for example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“hunting-gathering  bands”  are  objective,  nations  are  imagined  out  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysticism inspired by a defunct military imperative. That was the imperative</p>
<p class="calibre1">to link every person living within a territory through a sense of identity that</p>
<p class="calibre1">can be made to seem more important than life itself. As Kantorowicz noted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it is not a coincidence that “at a certain moment in history the state in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract or the state as a corporation appeared as a corpus mysticism and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">death for this new mystical body appeared equal in value to the death of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crusader  for  the  cause  of  God<a href="#calibre_link-23">!”39  </a>In  this  sense,  the  nation-state  can,  be understood as a mystical construct. Yet as Bil ig notes, nationalism is “a banal</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysticism, which is so banal that al  the mysticism seems to have evaporated</p>
<p class="calibre1">long ago.” It “binds ‘us’ to the homeland&mdash;that special place which is more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than just a place, more than a mere geophysical area. In al  this, the homeland</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  made  to  look  homely,  beyond  question  and,  should  the  occasion  arise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">worth the price of sacri ce. And men, in particular, are given their special, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure-saturated reminders of the possibilities of sacri ce.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">40</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  imaginative  link  between  the  nation  and  home  continues  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">highlighted by nationalists at every opportunity. As Bil ig suggests, the nation</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  “imagined  as  homely  space,  cozy  within  its  borders,  secure  against  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous outside world. And ‘we’ the nation within the homeland can so</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily  imagine  ‘ourselves’  as  some  sort  of  family. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”41</a>  The  clichés  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalism,  tirelessly  and  routinely  repeated,  include  many  commonplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">metaphors  of  kinship  and  identity.  They  associate  the  nation  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual’s sense of “inclusive  tness,” a powerful motive for altruism and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacri ce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">321</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-221"></a> <i class="calibre4">“That  sacrificial  altruism  does  exist  in  social  insects,  other  nonhuman</i> <i class="calibre4">animals, and humans implies that maximization of self-interest cannot be solely</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;R. PAUL SHAW AND YUWA WONG</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NATIONALISM AND INCLUSIVE FITNESS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Our main focus in this book is on objective “megapolitical” factors that alter</p>
<p class="calibre1">the costs and rewards of human choices. The underlying premise upon which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the predictive power of the analysis rests is that individuals wil  seek rewards</p>
<p class="calibre1">and shun costs. This is an essential truth of what Charles Darwin cal ed “the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy  of  nature.”  But  it  is  not  the  whole  truth.  Simple  reward</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimization does not explain everything in life. However, it does il uminate</p>
<p class="calibre1">two of the three main forms of human sociality, identi ed by Pierre Van Den</p>
<p class="calibre1">Berghe  as  “reciprocity  and  coercion. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”43</a>  By  “reciprocity”  Van  Den  Berghe means  “cooperation  for  mutual  bene t. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”44</a>  The  most  complex  and  far-reaching  examples  of  reciprocity  are  market  interactions:  trading,  buying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sel ing,  producing,  and  other  economic  activities.  “Coercion  is  the  use  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">force for one-sided bene t, that is, for purposes of intra-speci c parasitism or</p>
<p class="calibre1">predation.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">45</a> As we have explored in this volume and two previous books, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we believe that coercion is a crucial element in human society, a larger one</p>
<p class="calibre1">than is usual y recognized. Coercion helps determine the security of property</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  limits  the  ability  of  individuals  to  enter  into  mutual y  bene cial</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation. Coercion underlies al  politics. The third element in Van Den</p>
<p class="calibre1">Berghe’s  typology  of  human  sociality  is  “kin  selection,”  the  cooperative</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior  that  animals  undertake  with  their  kin.  Kin  selection,  which  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">described  more  ful y  below,  is  also  a  crucial  feature  of  the  “economy  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Jack Hirshleifer has written, “[T]he revival of Darwinian evolutionary</p>
<p class="calibre1">selection theory as applied to problems of social behaviour, which has come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be known as sociobiology,” has “a distinctly economic aspect.” And:</p>
<p class="calibre1">322</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-222"></a>Looking  over  the  whole  realm  of  life,  sociobiology  is  attempting  to  nd  the general  laws  determining  the  multifarious  forms  of  association  among</p>
<p class="calibre1">organisms.  For  example,  Why  do  we  sometimes  observe  sex  and  families, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes sex without families, sometimes neither sex nor families? Why do</p>
<p class="calibre1">some  animals  ock,  others  remain  solitary?  Within  groups,  why  do  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes observe hierarchical dominance patterns, sometimes not? Why do</p>
<p class="calibre1">organisms  in  some  species  partition  territories,  others  not?  What  determines</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sel essness of the social insects, and why is this pattern so rare in Nature? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  do  we  see  resources  al ocated  peaceful y,  when  by  means  of  violence? </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are questions both posed and answered in recognizably economic terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sociobiologists  ask  what  are  the  net  advantages  of  the  observed  association</p>
<p class="calibre1">patterns  to  the  organisms  displaying  them,  and  what  are  the  mechanisms</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby  these  patterns  persist  in  social  equilibrium  states.  It  is  perhaps  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">assertion of  <i class="calibre4">economic-behavioural continuity</i> between man and other life-forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">(termed  “genetic  capitalism”  by  one  detractor)  that  explains  the  hostility  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some ideologues to sociobiology<a href="#calibre_link-23">…46</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  introduce  sociobiology  into  our  analysis  of  nationalism  because  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">provides  perspective  on  aspects  of  human  nature  that  help  facilitate</p>
<p class="calibre1">systematic coercion. We agree with natural scientist Colin Tudge, author of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Time Before History, </i> that before we can understand the current world, </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  less  gain  a  perspective  on  that  to  come,  we  need  to  understand  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">preface to history. That means we must “look at ourselves on the grand scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">of time. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”47</a> Tudge reminds us “that beneath the surface tremors of our lives</p>
<p class="calibre1">there  are  much  deeper  and  more  powerful  forces  at  work  that  in  the  end</p>
<p class="calibre1">a ect us al  and al  our fel ow creatures.…” <a href="#calibre_link-23">48</a> We suspect that among “these</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeper  and  more  powerful  forces”  is  a  genetical y  in uenced  motivational</p>
<p class="calibre1">component  undergirding  nationalism.  As  Hirshleifer  points  out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">paraphrasing Adam Smith and R. H. Coase,  <i class="calibre4">“human desires are ultimately</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">adaptive  responses</i>  shaped  by  man’s  biological  nature  and  situation  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”49</a>  This  comes  to  the  fore  with  the  obviously  biological  al usions  in most discussions of nationalism. Even in the United States, a conspicuously</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiethnic nation, the government is personi ed in familial terms as  <i class="calibre4">“Uncle</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Biological Inheritance</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">323</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-318"></a>In  short,  human  nature,  the  origin  of  species,  and  their  development  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural  selection  are  elements  to  be  considered  in  understanding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuing evolution of human society. In the present case we are considering</p>
<p class="calibre1">the likely human response to new circumstances occasioned by information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology. Particularly, we are focusing on the reaction to the advent of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy  and  its  many  consequences,  including  the  emergence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic inequality more pronounced than anything seen in the past. Keys</p>
<p class="calibre1">to at least some of the expected response lie in our genetic inheritance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  a  new  species  is  formed,  it  does  not  discard  al   the  DNA  that  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried in its previous form, but adds to it. The whole di erence between a</p>
<p class="calibre1">human  being  and  a  chimpanzee  is  contained  in  less  than  2  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">DNA in each species; slightly over 98 percent of their DNA is common to</p>
<p class="calibre1">both, and some of it can be traced back to very primitive early organisms, far</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the historic chain of development. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GENETIC INERTIA</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Human cultures similarly contain elements that are universal, some of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are indeed inherited from prehuman ancestors. How we seek food, how we</p>
<p class="calibre1">mate, how we form families, how we relate to strange groups, how we defend</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves are al  complex mixtures of instinct and culture, with very primitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">roots. They are also al  capable of modern adaptations, such as those that have</p>
<p class="calibre1">characterized the nation-state in the modern period. If we think of cultures in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this way, we shal  see them as paral el to genetic development. The three great</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erences  are  that  cultures  are  transmitted  by  the  information  chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">between human beings, not by the genetic chain between generations; they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can to some extent&mdash;perhaps less than we think&mdash;be changed by conscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">intel igent action; they change with the prevailing environment of costs and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewards, which mutates much faster than genetic change. Physical y we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">very similar to our ancestors of thirty thousand years, ago; cultural y we have</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved quite far away from them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Evolutionary Models</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">324</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-223"></a>There  are  two  biological  models  of  the  way  in  which  species  evolve.  The scienti c  orthodoxy  is  neo-Darwinist.  Random  genetic  changes  produce</p>
<p class="calibre1">di erent physical forms. Most of these forms have no advantage to survival, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">for instance the albino blackbird, and these tend to the out. A smal  number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them are helpful to survival and spread through the species. There are stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">many di culties in this theory, which may be sorted out by scientists in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next century, but randomness and the survival of favorable adaptations are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  current  scienti c  orthodoxy  and  have  some  explanatory  power.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">alternative is some variant of the theory of the early twentieth century French</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GENETICALLY INFLUENCED MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  biological  perspective  on  human  behavior  was  enhanced  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduction of the concept of “inclusive  tness” in 1963 by W. D. Hamilton</p>
<p class="calibre1">in “The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior.” Hamilton recognized that while</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans  are  fundamental y  given  to  self-oriented  behavior,  they  also</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertake occasional acts of altruism or self-sacri ce that o er no apparent</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ts in terms of the life of the individual. Hamilton sought to reconcile</p>
<p class="calibre1">these apparent contradictions by positing that the fundamental maximizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">325</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-29"></a>unit is not the individual organism but the gene. Individuals in any species</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   seek  to  maximize  not  simply  their  own  personal  wel -being  but  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hamilton cal ed their “inclusive  tness.” He argued that “inclusive  tness” </p>
<p class="calibre1">involves  not  only  personal  survival  in  the  Darwinian  sense,  but  also  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enhanced  reproduction  and  survival  of  close  relatives  who  share  the  same</p>
<p class="calibre1">genes. <a href="#calibre_link-23">52</a> Hamilton’s “inclusive  tness” thesis helps il uminate many otherwise</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious features of human societies, including aspects of politics in nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Altruism: Misnomer or Fossil Kin Selection? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">According  to  Van  Den,  Berghe,  “Altruism,  then,  is  directed  mostly  at  kin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">especial y at close kin, and is, in fact, a misnomer. It represents the ultimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">genetic  sel shness.  It  is  but  the  blind  expression  of  inclusive  tness</p>
<p class="calibre1">maximization.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">53</a> This is not to say, however, that there is no altruism absent</p>
<p class="calibre1">the close genetic relationship referred to by Hamilton and Van Den Berghe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  uncertainties  introduced  by  the  fact  that  humans  reproduce  sexual y</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than through asexual cloning al  but guarantee that an inclination to</p>
<p class="calibre1">“inclusive  tness maximization” would stimulate a good deal of “altruism” </p>
<p class="calibre1">rebounding to the bene t of al eles other than the “sel sh gene.” In the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">instance,  there  is  always  the  possibility  that  some  persons  who  undertake</p>
<p class="calibre1">helping actions may do so in the mistaken assumption that they are helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">close kin. The father who undertakes a sacri cial action for his o spring may</p>
<p class="calibre1">not,  in  fact,  be  the  progenitor  but  may  merely  think  he  is. <a href="#calibre_link-21">IV</a>  This  is  not merely a theme for soap operas; it is il ustrative of a primordial puzzle&mdash; that</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival of the “sel sh genes” is probably facilitated if each apparent father</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaves “as if” he actual y is the father, despite the possibility that he is not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen in their proper light, however, as Hirshleifer points out, many of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paradoxes  of  “altruism”  are  semantic  muddles  that  frequently  confuse  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">mislead  people  into  losing  sight  of  the  context  of  competition  in  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">“helping”  could  convey  a  survival  advantage:  “ ‘If  an  altruism  choice  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategy  is  to  be   <i class="calibre4">viable</i>  in  competition  with  non-altruism,  altruism  must</p>
<p class="calibre1">contribute to self-survival more than non-altruism does, and therefore it can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">real y be altruism.’ Al  such muddles could be avoided if we drop the term</p>
<p class="calibre1">326</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-224"></a>‘altruism’ and ask instead: What are the determinants of the entirely objective</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomenon that can be cal ed  <i class="calibre4">helping? <a href="#calibre_link-23">” </a></i><a href="#calibre_link-23"> 54</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This question is perhaps most interesting in the case of “kinship helping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hamilton’s basic formulation of inclusive  tness involved a biological cost-</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene t  analysis  in  which  an  individual,  or  “the  gene  control ing  helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaviour,” values the survival of an identical copy of itself equal y to its own</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival. Therefore, the wil ingness to undertake helping, let alone sacri ce, </p>
<p class="calibre1">varies  with  the  chance  that  another  individual  has  an  identical  gene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speci cal y, a gene for kinship helping instructs a man (other things equal)</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  give  his  life  if  he  can  thereby  save  two  siblings,  four  half-siblings,  eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">cousins, etc. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”55</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">PROBABILITY PROBLEMS OF INCLUSIVE FITNESS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While  this  biologic  seems  clear  in  principle,  upon  closer  examination  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">disguises a number of di culties. For example, the fact that one’s siblings or</p>
<p class="calibre1">children may have a 50 percent probability of sharing an identical gene does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, in strict logic, mean that it is actual y expressed in them. Every individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">carries two sets of each gene, one from, the father and one from the mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this, of course, means that only half of the genes carried by an individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">parent are necessarily present in o spring. Furthermore, there is always the</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk of mutation in reproduction, which, unlikely though it may be, reduces</p>
<p class="calibre1">the certainty of genetic cost-bene t analysis. So if the metaphor of “gene as</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimizer” is taken seriously, the case of the pater who is not the progenitor is</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  the  most  clear-cut  example  of  a  broader  problem.  If  it  is  indeed  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival of the “sel sh gene” that is optimized by sacri cing for near-relatives, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then any possibility that results in the substitution of another al ele for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">identical copy of the “sel sh gene” may be considered one of those intricate</p>
<p class="calibre1">tricks that Mother Nature plays on herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Uncertain Consequences</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Altruism directed toward kin therefore involves problems. Not only is there</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  probability  problem  for  the  “sel sh  gene”  that  apparent  relatives  of  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">host may not, in fact, share its identical copies. There is also the di culty of</p>
<p class="calibre1">327</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-414"></a>determining  under  conditions  of  uncertainty  whether  any  given  gesture  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacri ce wil , in fact, primarily bene t relatives rather than others. (Sacri ce</p>
<p class="calibre1">that primarily bene ts others may actual y harm the inclusive  tness of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sel sh gene by reducing the prospects that it wil  be represented in succeeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">populations.) Consider an awful example inspired by the news while we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">writing.  Suppose  a  parent  in  Dunblane,  Scotland,  learned  on  short  notice</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  an  armed  lunatic  was  heading  into  a  local  school  with  the  apparent</p>
<p class="calibre1">intention of doing harm. By acting instantly, he or she could undertake the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heroic but possibly doomed gesture of confronting the lunatic, and thereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly save his or her children at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or possibly not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even a ruthless lunatic intent on kil ing every child on the planet would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">limited  in  the  harm  he  could  do  before  running  short  of  ammunition  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">being subdued by others. Had the sacri cing parent decided not to intervene, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more likely than not his children would have survived in any event, as most</p>
<p class="calibre1">children at the school did. Al  the harm that a gal ant act of sacri ce would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  prevented  probably  would  otherwise  have  fal en  on  the  children  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">others. So by risking his or her life, primarily for the children of others, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">father  or  mother  in  question  might  actual y  have  reduced  his  “inclusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tness.”  By  depriving  al   his  children  of  one  of  their  parents,  he  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably  have  left  those  children  in  a  worsened  position  in  the  Darwinian</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this is admittedly a strained example, it is also realistic. It re ects the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact that there are countless circumstances in life in which large or smal  acts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  helping  have  bene cial  e ects.  In  many  cases,  the  direct  bene ciaries  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such actions cannot be easily isolated to closely related kin. And ironical y, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">we consider below, this may be part of the survival bene t that enabled those</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  less  discriminate  helping  genes  to  endure  al   the  mil ennia  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasantness until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Altruism and Genetic Inertia</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If, as we believe, the “sel sh gene” thesis is an accurate approximation of what</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivates human action, it would be too simple to suppose that the helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">or sacri cial behavior it engenders could operate narrowly and solely for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">328</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-225"></a>bene t of actual relatives. Imperfect knowledge makes distinguishing kin an</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain  art  in  some  circumstances.  And  even  assuming  that  kin  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">known, actual representation of any given “sel sh gene” in the population of</p>
<p class="calibre1">kin  could  not  be  ascertained  as  more  than  a  matter  of  probabilities.  Until</p>
<p class="calibre1">recently, it would have been impossible to distinguish actual genetic markers</p>
<p class="calibre1">among  individuals.  And  we  are  stil   some  distance  from  being  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">practical y distinguish which near-relatives actual y express whatever “sel sh</p>
<p class="calibre1">gene”  is  optimizing  its  survival.  Beyond  that  is  the  greater  di culty  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">con ning bene ts to kin rather than others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, it is also obvious from experience that humans sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">divert their “nurturing instincts” for the bene t of nonkin if appropriate kin</p>
<p class="calibre1">are unavailable. The most clear-cut example of this is the behavior of parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward  adopted  children,  or  even  the  behavior  of  certain  persons,  usual y</p>
<p class="calibre1">childless,  toward  their  household  pets.  It  is  not  unheard  of  for  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals to court serious injury and even death to rescue cats trapped in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree. Certainly, in any given year, a not-insigni cant number of persons perish</p>
<p class="calibre1">in household accidents precipitated in some fashion by pets who  nd their</p>
<p class="calibre1">way into jeopardy. What is true of pets is more true of adoptive children. It is</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly  not  a  stretch  to  say  that  parents  of  adopted  children  often  treat</p>
<p class="calibre1">them “as if” they were kin, thus giving the concept of “kin selection” another</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such  cases  do  not  discredit  the  “sel sh  gene”  theory  as  much  as  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">critics would wish. To the contrary. We see examples of people behaving “as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if”  they  were  sacri cing  for  close  relatives  to  advance  their  own  inclusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tness, as instances of “genetic inertia.” In other words, they re ect the fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">noted  by  Howard  Margolis  in   <i class="calibre4">Selfishness,  Altruism  and  Rationality, </i>  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“human  society  changed  faster”  than  human  genetic  makeup.  People, </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore, continue to act “substantial y as if living in a smal  hunter-gatherer</p>
<p class="calibre1">group. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”56 </a>A crucial characteristic of such groups was, as Van Den Berghe put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were smal  in-bred populations of a few hundred individuals.… Members</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the tribe, though subdivided into smal er kin groups, saw themselves as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single people, solidary against the outside world, and interlinked by a web of</p>
<p class="calibre1">kinship  and  marriage  making  the  tribe  in  fact  a  superfamily.  A  high  rate  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">inbreeding assured that most spouses were also kinsmen.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">57</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">329</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-226"></a>In  short,  for  al   of  human  existence  prior  to  the  advent  of  agriculture, ethnic  groups  were  “inbreeding  superfamilies.”  Given  this  past  identity</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  the  family  and  the  in-group,  there  could  wel   be  a  genetical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">in uenced  tendency  to  treat  the  in-group  as  kin.  It  is  easy  to  imagine  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">such behavior could have had survival value in the past when every member</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the “inbreeding superfamily” was kin. As Margolis suggests, it is easy to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine that for “such smal  bands of hunter-gatherers, closely related, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">inclusive  sel shness  (aside  from  any  prospect  of  reciprocity  or  vengeance)</p>
<p class="calibre1">would alone support a measure of commitment to group-interest. One can</p>
<p class="calibre1">then argue that some tendency to group-interested motivation survives as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of fossil kin-altruism…” <a href="#calibre_link-23">58</a> In other words, because we retain the genetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">makeup of hunter-gatherers, our behavior toward in-groups re ects the kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of “altruism” that would be expected to optimize the survival success of in-</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups comprised by “inbreeding superfamilies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presumably,  as  Margolis  speculates,  this  tendency  for  group-interested</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior, arising from “fossil kin-altruism” or genetic inertia, contributed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the survival of  <i class="calibre4">Homo sapiens</i> “while other humanoid species went extinct.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">59</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Epigenesis</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  see  this  “as  if”  behavior  as  a  prime  example  of  “epigenesis,”  or  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tendency  of  genetical y  in uenced  motivational  factors  to  innately  bias</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans to favor certain choices over others. In other words, the human mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not a  <i class="calibre4">tabula rasa, </i> or blank slate, but a hard drive with prewired circuits that</p>
<p class="calibre1">make certain responses more readily learned and attractive than others. Thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">the proposition that the mind is disposed to think in terms of an out-group</p>
<p class="calibre1">that excites enmity or hostility and an in-group to which one feels great amity</p>
<p class="calibre1">or loyalty usual y reserved for kin. <a href="#calibre_link-23">60</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  epigenetic  tendency  to  behave  with  an  in-group  as  if  it  comprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">close  relatives  creates  a  vulnerability  to  manipulation  that  has  commonly</p>

<p class="calibre1">Consider the strong tendency of politicians everywhere to describe the state</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  terms  borrowed  from  kinship.  The  nation  is  “our  fatherland”  or  “our</p>

<p class="calibre1">and sisters. <a href="#calibre_link-23">”62 </a>The fact that states as cultural y di erent as France, China, and Egypt employ such similes is not a rhetorical coincidence, as we see it, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prime  example  of  “epigenesis”  or  the  tendency  of  genetical y  in uenced</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivational factors to innately bias humans to favor certain choices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How does this epigenesis work? The identi cation mechanism employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to harness emotional loyalty to the nation-state makes use of various devices</p>
<p class="calibre1">that would have been markers of kinship in the primitive past “to link the</p>

<p class="calibre1">example, Shaw and Wong focus on  ve identi cation devices used by modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states to mobilize their populations against out-groups. These are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. a common language</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. a shared homeland</p>

<p class="calibre1">traced  to  the  way  that  these  identi cation  devices  have  been  adopted  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed  up  in  the  language  of  kinship,  as  il ustrated  in  the  French  soldiers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">chant quoted above. Such mobilization devices, which refer to the state as the</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Genetic Accounting</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">331</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-228"></a>The imaginary character of these kinship links as far as the state is concerned</p>
<p class="calibre1">is evidenced by the fact that they possess none of the degrees of variability</p>
<p class="calibre1">that characterize actual kinship. Even in extended families, where everyone is</p>
<p class="calibre1">related, not everyone is related to the same degree. Parents and siblings are the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closest relations, grandparents and cousins are less close, with distant, kissing</p>
<p class="calibre1">cousins so remote that they are barely more likely than complete strangers to</p>
<p class="calibre1">share any given gene in common. Husbands and wives general y are no longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely related, as they tended to be in the Stone Age. In any event, al  actual</p>
<p class="calibre1">kinship is de nable in mathematical terms as the “coe cient of relatedness,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which Hamilton calculated as a measure of genetic overlap. <a href="#calibre_link-23">65</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">By contrast, the national “family” is imagined to be total y and elastical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">coincident  with  the  state’s  territorial  dimensions.  Nationality  extends</p>
<p class="calibre1">uniformly,  like  a  liquid,  into  every  crevice  within  the  strictly  de ned</p>
<p class="calibre1">boundaries.  Benedict  Anderson  writes,  “In  the  modern  conception,  state</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty is ful y,  atly and evenly operative over each square centimeter of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a legal y demarcated territory.” <a href="#calibre_link-23">66</a> And, of course, when it comes to sacri ce</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the state, the coe cient of imaginary relatedness is always one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This identi cation of inclusive  tness with the nation-state is interesting</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it could help inform the disposition of humans to welcome or resist</p>
<p class="calibre1">the changes of the new mil ennium. As we have explored earlier, prior to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age  al   types  of  society  were  territorial y  based.  They  either</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed around the home territory of the nucleus ethnic group, or, as with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nation-state,  played  upon  the  same  motives  of  group  solidarity  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mobilize force for defense of a local territory against outsiders. In every case, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the stranger outside of one’s immediate territory who was feared as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy.  Given  the  assumptions  of  kin  selection  in  the  primordial  past,  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">made sense. When humanity emerged in its current genetic form, members</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the tribe were close kin. They were members of a nucleus ethnic group, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“the inbreeding superfamily.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  there  real y  was  a  practical  economic  reason,  given  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperatives of kin selection, for the individual to identify the prosperity and</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival of immediate kin with that of his tribe, or superfamily. A member of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a hunter-gatherer tribe real y did depend for his prosperity upon the success</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the whole tribe. There was no independent property, nor any way that an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual  or  family  could  plausibly  have  hoped  to  survive  and  prosper  if</p>
<p class="calibre1">332</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-229"></a>detached from the tribe. This strongly linked the individual’s self-interest to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that of the group. In Hirshleifer’s words, “To the extent that members of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">group share a common fate or outcome, helping one another becomes self-</p>

<p class="calibre1">It is perhaps a mark of the importance of epigenesis in informing attitudes</p>
<p class="calibre1">that so little notice has been taken of the ironies of in-group identi cation as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  relates  to  the  modern  nation-state.  The  logic  of  violence  in  the  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">period tended to confound the very impulse that gave rise to the tendency to</p>
<p class="calibre1">identify  tness with the in-group in the  rst place. Why? Because rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilitating the survival and prosperity of near-relatives in a hostile world, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">333</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-230"></a>identi cation of the individual’s “inclusive  tness” with a national in-group</p>
<p class="calibre1">diluted the value of any act of sacri ce the individual might have made to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">level of insigni cance for his kin. The typical modern nation-state was simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">too  large  to  al ow  for  a  statistical y  signi cant  “coe cient  of  relatedness” </p>
<p class="calibre1">between the individual and other citizens of the nation that laid claim to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only was the proportion of close relatives within the in-group sharply</p>
<p class="calibre1">diminished from almost unity in the Stone Age to a bare chemical trace in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century;  the  “coe cient  of  relatedness”  between  the  individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizen  and  the  rest  of  the  nation  would  not,  in  most  cases,  have  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">signi cantly  higher  than  with  the  whole  human  race.  An  “in-group”  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">tens of mil ions or even hundreds of mil ions (or in the case of the Chinese, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more than a bil ion members) became so gigantic as to dilute the inclusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tness e ect of any sacri ce or bene t conveyed to the scale of a spit in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ocean.  In  strict  logic,  therefore,  the  modern  nationalist,  unlike  the  hunter-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gatherer of the Stone Age, could not reasonably expect any gesture of sacri ce</p>
<p class="calibre1">or helping for his “in-group” to enhance the survival prospects for his family</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a meaningful way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  national  economies  became  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fundamental  units  of  account  in  which  wel -being  was  measured  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modem  era,  the  largest  obstacle  to  the  talented  individual’s  success,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore to that of his kin, became the burdens imposed in the name of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation, the in-group itself. This, at least, was true for those primarily engaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  reciprocal  rather  than  coercive  sociality&mdash;to  revisit  Van  Den  Berghe’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">categories of human behavior. <a href="#calibre_link-24">68</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The logic of the nation-state suggests that the ultimate price of citizenship</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  sacri ce  and  death.  As  Jane  Bethke  Elshtain  observed,  nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">indoctrinate citizens more for sacri ce than aggression: “The young man goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">to war not so much to kil  as to die, to forfeit his particular body for that of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the large body, the body politic.” <a href="#calibre_link-24">69</a> The impulse to sacri ce is no less active</p>
<p class="calibre1">where  the  taxpayer  is  concerned.  Paying  taxes,  like  bearing  arms,  is  a  duty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than an exchange in which one forgoes money to obtain some product</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  service  of  an  equal  or  greater  value.  This  much  is  acknowledged  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">common speech. People speak of a “tax burden” as they do not speak of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“food  burden”  of  shopping  for  nutriments,  or  the  “car  burden”  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchasing  an  automobile,  or  a  “vacation  burden”  for  traveling,  precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">334</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-231"></a>because  commercial  purchases  are  general y  fair  exchanges.  Otherwise,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">buyers would not make them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this respect, nationalism shows how epigenesis can reverse the logic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Darwinian “economy of nature.” The nation-state facilitated systematic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">territorial y based predation. Unlike the situation faced by hunter-gatherers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Stone Age, the main parasite and predator upon the individual at the end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  twentieth  century  was  not  likely  to  be  the  “outsider,”  the  foreign</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy,  but  rather  the  presumed  embodiment  of  the  “in-group,”  the  local</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state itself. Thus the main advantage o ered by the advent of assets</p>
<p class="calibre1">that transcend territoriality in the Information Age is precisely the fact that</p>
<p class="calibre1">such  assets  can  be  placed  beyond  the  reach  of  the  systematic  coercion</p>
<p class="calibre1">mobilized by the local nation-state in whose territory the would-be Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individual was resident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If our view is correct, microtechnology wil  make it technical y feasible for</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals  to  largely  escape  from  the  burdens  of  subordinate  citizenship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  wil   be  extranational  sovereigns  over  themselves,  not  subjects,  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new “Virtual City,” owing al egiance by contract or private treaty in a fashion</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  reminiscent  of  premodern  Europe,  where  merchants  secured</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  treaties  and  charters  to  protect  themselves  “from  arbitrary</p>

<p class="calibre1">miracle  it  implies&mdash;escaping  the  tyranny  of  place&mdash;depend  upon  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil ingness  of  individuals  to  entrust  much  of  their  wealth  and  futures  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">strangers. In strict genetic accounting, of course, those strangers would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessarily be less genetical y close than most of our “fel ow citizens” upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom in recent centuries we have been bound to depend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">335</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-232"></a>The question is whether the perverse results of in-group amity in the case</p>

<p class="calibre1">Wil   the  “left-behinds”  who  stand  to  lose  the  bene ts  of  coercive</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution treat the death of the nation-state as as if it were an attack on</p>
<p class="calibre1">kin? The  rst quarter century of the new mil ennium wil  tel . The emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">reactions could be complex. The fact that 115 mil ion persons gave their lives</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghting  for  nation-states  in  the  twentieth  century  is  stark  evidence  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">power of epigenesis<a href="#calibre_link-24">.71</a> It shows that many did consider the survival of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations to be matters of life-and-death importance. The question is whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  attitude  wil   carry  over  into  a  new  age  with  di erent  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that genetical y in uenced sacri ce on behalf of the nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">often militated against the evolutionary purpose of kin selection also tel s you</p>
<p class="calibre1">that humans are adaptable enough to adjust to many circumstances for which</p>
<p class="calibre1">we were not genetical y programmed in the conditions of the Stone Age. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tudge elaborates in describing the “extreme generalness” of human beings:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are the animal equivalent of the Turing machine: the universal device</p>
<p class="calibre1">that can be turned to any task. <a href="#calibre_link-24">”72 </a>Which tendency wil  come to the surface in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the coming transition crisis? Probably both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commercialization of sovereignty itself depends upon the wil ingness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Sovereign  Individuals  and  many  mil ions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">others to deploy their assets in the “First Bank of Nowhere” in order to secure</p>
<p class="calibre1">immunity  from  direct  compulsion.  This  type  of  trust  has  no  obvious</p>
<p class="calibre1">analogue  in  the  primordial  past.  There  were  few  assets  in  the  Stone  Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those that did exist were hoarded under the control of a tribe, an “inbreeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">superfamily”  that  was  paranoid  about  outsiders.  Yet  notwithstanding  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutionary  novelty  of  the  cybereconomy,  it  gives  humans  the  chance  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">express our most novel genetic inheritance&mdash;the intel igence that comes along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with our outsized brains. Those among the information elite wil  certainly be</p>
<p class="calibre1">smart enough to recognize a good thing when they see one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, the creation of assets that are largely immune to predation should</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y  rebound  in  a  practical  way  to  increase  the  “inclusive  tness”  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign  Individuals.  While  the  economic  logic  of  participating  in  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">those “whose livelihoods rest not so much on the ownership of property as</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  the  manipulation  of  information. <a href="#calibre_link-24">”74  </a>Lasch  laments  the  extranational</p>
<p class="calibre1">character of the emerging information economy. He writes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  markets  in  which  the  new  elites  operate  is  now  international  in  scope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their fortunes are tied to enterprises that operate across national boundaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  are  more  concerned  with  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  system  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole  than  with  any  of  its  parts.  Their  loyalties&mdash;if  the  term  is  not  itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">anachronistic in this context&mdash;are international rather than regional, national</p>
<p class="calibre1">or  local.  They  have  more  in  common  with  their  counterparts  in  Brussels  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hong  Kong  than  with  the  masses  of  Americans  not  yet  plugged  into  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Although Lasch was far from a dispassionate observer, and he obviously</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant his portrait of the information elite to be un attering, his contempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">for those who are liberated from the tyranny of place rests on a perception of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some of the same developments that are the focus of this book. When we read</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lasch’s  critiques  or  those  of  Mickey  Kaus   <i class="calibre4">(The  End  of  Equality), </i>  Michael</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walzer  <i class="calibre4">(Spheres of Justice), </i>  or  Robert  Reich   <i class="calibre4">(The  Work  of  Nations), </i>  we  see parts of our analysis con rmed, often unhappily, by authors who are deeply</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsympathetic  to  many  of  the  consequences  of  the  deepening  of  markets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">much  less  the  denationalization  of  Sovereign  Individuals.  Lasch  lambastes</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  with  extranational  ambitions  “who  covet  membership  in  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">aristocracy  of  brains”  for  “cultivating  ties  with  the  international  market  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast-moving money, glamour, fashion and popular culture.” He continues:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  question  whether  they  think  of  themselves  as  Americans  at  al . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patriotism,  certainly,  does  not  rank  very  high  in  their  hierarchy  of  virtues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Multiculturalism,” on the other hand, suits them to perfection, conjuring up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the agreeable image of a global bazaar in which exotic cuisines, exotic styles of</p>

<p class="calibre1">and  Walzer  do  not  dispute  that  clearheaded  cost-bene t  analysis  makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship obsolete for persons of high skil s. They do not propose that those</p>

<p class="calibre1">where  their  best  interests  lie.  Nor  do  they  pretend  that  the  compound-</p>

<p class="calibre1">national social security program, much less income taxes, produces a better</p>
<p class="calibre1">return than private investment. To the contrary, they understand arithmetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  have  seen  the  sums  to  their  obvious  conclusions.  But  rather  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledge the subversive logic of economic rationality, they recoil from it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">counting it as “betrayal” for the information elite to transcend the tyranny of</p>

<p class="calibre1">Like  Pat  Buchanan,  the  social  democrats  are  economic  nationalists  who</p>

<p class="calibre1">passionately  about  their  view  of  where  the  best  interests  of  the  masses  lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While they do not explicitly recognize the denationalization of the individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  such,  they  rail  against  its  early  hints  and  manifestations,  what  Walzer</p>

<p class="calibre1">“seep across boundaries” in order to buy things which, as Lasch elaborates, </p>

<p class="calibre1">without  waiting  for  them  to  be  e ected  by  “group  decision  and  group</p>
<p class="calibre1">action,” to quote Frederic C. Lane’s formulation of an old dilemma<a href="#calibre_link-24">.79</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  price  paid  for  protection  becomes  subject  “to  the  principle  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">substitution,”  this  wil   lay  bare  the  arithmetic  of  compulsion,  intensifying</p>
<p class="calibre1">con ict between the new cosmopolitan elite of the Information Age and “the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  poor,”  the  remainder  of  the  population  who  are  largely</p>
<p class="calibre1">monoglot  and  do  not  excel  in  problem-solving  or  possess  some  global y</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketable  skil .  These  “losers”  or  “left-behinds,”  as  Thomas  L.  Friedman</p>
<p class="calibre1">describes them, wil  no doubt continue to identify their wel -being with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">political life of existing nation-states. <a href="#calibre_link-24">80</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOST POLITICAL AGENDAS WILL BE REACTIONARY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most  of  those  who  harbor  an  ardent  political  agenda,  whether  nationalist, </p>
<p class="calibre1">environmentalist, or socialist, wil  ral y to defend the wobbling nation-state as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twenty- rst century opens. Over time, it wil  become ever more obvious</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  survival  of  the  nation-state  and  the  nationalist  sensibility  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">preconditions for preserving a realm for political compulsion. As Bil ig points</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,  nationalism  “is  the  condition  for  conventional  (political)  strategies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever the particular politics. <a href="#calibre_link-24">”81  </a>Therefore,  the  nationalist  content  in  al political  programs  wil   swel   like  a  glutton’s  paunch  in  the  years  ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Environmentalists, for example, wil  focus less on protecting “Mother Earth” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and more on protecting the “motherland.” For reasons we explore later, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation and citizenship wil  be especial y sacred to those who value equality</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly. More than they may now understand, they wil  come to agree  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christopher  Lasch,  who  fol owed  Hannah  Arendt  in  proclaiming,  “It  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship  that  confers  equality,  not  equality  that  creates  a  right  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship.” <a href="#calibre_link-24">82</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">340</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-497"></a>The privatization of sovereignty wil  de ate the industrial-era premium on</p>
<p class="calibre1">equality  by  severing  ties  of  the  creators  of  wealth  to  nation  and  place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Citizenship  wil   no  longer  serve  as  a  mechanism  for  enforcing  income</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution based upon the equality of the vote within a con ned territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The consequences wil  include another bruising for the progressive view of</p>
<p class="calibre1">history. Contrary to the expectations of supposedly forward-thinking people</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the twentieth century opened, the free market was not destroyed by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades  but  left  triumphant.  The  Marxists  anticipated  the  eclipse  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism,  which  never  happened,  to  lead  to  the  transcendence  of  nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states and the emergence of a universal class consciousness among workers. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, the state wil  be eclipsed, but in a very di erent way. Something more</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly  the  opposite  to  their  expectation  is  happening.  The  triumph  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalism  wil   lead  to  the  emergence  of  a  new  global,  or  extranational, </p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness among the capitalists, many of whom wil  become Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals. Far from depending upon the state to discipline the workers, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Marxists imagined, the ablest, wealthiest persons were net losers from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions  of  the  nation-state.  It  is  clearly  they  who  have  the  most  to  gain  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcending nationalism as markets triumph over compulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  not  immediately,  but  soon,  certainly  within  the  span  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation,  almost  everyone  among  the  information  elite  wil   elect  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">domicile his income-earning activities in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age transforms the globe, it wil  impress an unmistakable</p>
<p class="calibre1">object lesson in compound interest. Within years, let alone decades, it wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">widely  understood  that  almost  anyone  of  talent  could  accumulate  a  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher net worth and enjoy a better life by abandoning high-tax nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already hinted at the staggering costs that the leading nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">impose, but as this is the crux of an issue that is little understood, it is worth</p>
<p class="calibre1">reemphasizing the opportunity costs of nationality. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Opportunity Costs</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Far  from  su ering  from  the  loss  or  curtailment  of  government  services</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently  nanced  by  high  taxes,  the  information  elite  wil   ourish  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unparal eled fashion. Simply by escaping the excess tax burden they now pay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they wil  gain a tremendous margin for improving the material wel -being of</p>
<p class="calibre1">341</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-356"></a>their  families.  As  previously  indicated,  each  $5,000  in  tax  paid  annual y reduces your lifetime net worth by $2.4 mil ion if you can earn 10 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual y  from  your  investments.  But  if  you  could  earn  20  percent,  each</p>
<p class="calibre1">$5,000  in  annual  tax  payments  would  leave  you  $44  mil ion  poorer  over  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">period of forty years. Cumulatively, paying $5,000 per year would therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost you more than a mil ion dol ars per year. At that rate, $250,000 per year</p>
<p class="calibre1">in tax would soon translate to an annual loss of more than $50 mil ion, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">$2.2  bil ion  in  a  lifetime.  And,  of  course,  sporadical y  higher  earnings,  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  a  few  years,  especial y  early  in  life,  imply  a  stil   more  startling  loss  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth to predatory taxation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your authors have seen to our own satisfaction that higher than 20 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns  are  possible.  Our  col eagues  at  Lines  Overseas  Management  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bermuda  earned  triple-digit  returns,  averaging  226  percent  per  annum, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during  the  years  when  we  were  writing  this  book.  Their  experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">underscores  what  the  spreadsheet  suggests,  that  for  many  high-income</p>
<p class="calibre1">earners  and  owners  of  capital,  predatory  taxation  imposes  a  lifetime  cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent to a large fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  individual  with  high  earnings  capacity  paying  taxes  at  Hong  Kong</p>
<p class="calibre1">rates could end up with a thousand times more wealth than someone with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same pretax performance paying taxes at North American or European</p>
<p class="calibre1">rates. To subject your capital to recurring invasion by a high-tax jurisdiction is</p>
<p class="calibre1">like running in a race and having someone shoot you every time you take a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stride.  If  you  could  enter  the  same  race  with  proper  protection  and  run</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhobbled, you would obviously go much farther, more quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Sovereign  Individuals  of  the  future  wil   take  advantage  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“transient” inclinations that so o end Christopher Lasch and other critics of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the information elite, and they wil  shop for the most pro table jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  which  to  domicile.  While  this  is  contrary  to  the  logic  of  nationalism,  it</p>
<p class="calibre1">accords with a compel ing economic logic. A 10 percent, let alone a tenfold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom-line di erence wil  frequently motivate pro t-maximizing individuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  alter  their  lifestyles  and  production  techniques,  as  wel   as  their  place  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">abode.  The  history  of  Western  civilization  is  a  record  of  restless  change  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  people  and  prosperity  have  repeatedly  migrated  to  new  areas  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  under  the  spur  of  meandering  megapolitical  conditions.  A</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousandfold di erence in bottom-line returns would match the most potent</p>
<p class="calibre1">342</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-237"></a>stimulus  that  has  ever  put  rational  people  in  motion.  Or  put  another  way, most people, particularly those Thomas L.

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SOVEREIGNTY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen in cost-bene t terms, citizenship was already a dreadful bargain as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century drew to a close. This was highlighted by an unconsciously</p>
<p class="calibre1">funny  Parliamentary  Research  Note  entitled  “Is  the  Queen  an  Australian</p>
<p class="calibre1">Citizen?” produced by Ian Ireland of the Australian Parliamentary Research</p>
<p class="calibre1">Service in August 1995<a href="#calibre_link-24">.83</a> Ireland canvasses the Australian Citizenship Act of</p>
<p class="calibre1">1948,  reviewing  the  four  means  by  which  one  can  obtain  Australian</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship. These are similar to the options for citizenship in other leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states, namely:</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship by birth</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship by adoption</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship by descent</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship by grant</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is al  unremarkable except that it focuses attention upon the distinction</p>
<p class="calibre1">between sovereignty and citizenship. As Ireland says, “Under traditional legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">and political concepts, the monarch is sovereign and the people are his/ her</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects. Subjects are bound to the monarch by al egiance and subjection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noting the obvious fact that Queen Elizabeth II is sovereign, he concludes</p>
<p class="calibre1">that “there is an argument that the Queen is not an Australian citizen. <a href="#calibre_link-24">”84</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,  she  is  not.  The  Queen,  long  may  she  live,  is  fortunate  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond caring about being a citizen. She is sovereign, the Sovereign over her</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects.  Like  a  handful  of  other  monarchs  in  the  world,  the  Queen  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereign  by  birth,  having  inherited  her  status  as  a  matter  of  custom  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">predates modern times. The idea of monarchy is ancient, going back to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earliest  historic  records  of  human  life.  Those  countries  that  have  retained</p>
<p class="calibre1">343</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-238"></a>their  monarchy  owe  their  constitution  to  their  ancient  history,  but  it  stil helps to decide the shape of their society, in terms of class prestige if not of</p>
<p class="calibre1">political power. Postmodern individuals, without the Queen’s head start, wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  obliged  to  invent  new  legal  rationales  upon  which  to  base  the   <i class="calibre4">de  facto</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty that information technology wil  hand them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign  Individuals  wil   also  have  to  cope  with  the  corrosive</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences  of  envy&mdash;a  di culty  that  sometimes  detains  monarchs,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">which  wil   be  more  intensely  felt  by  persons  who  are  not  traditional y</p>
<p class="calibre1">venerated but invent their own sovereignty. As Helmut Schoeck wrote in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehensive survey,  <i class="calibre4">Envy, </i> “Where there is only one king, one president of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the United States&mdash;in other words, one member only of a particular status&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  can  live  with  relative  impunity  the  kind  of  life  which,  even  on  a  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal er  scale,  would  arouse  indignation  in  the  same  society  were  it  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopted  by  successful  members  of  larger  professional  or  social  groups.” <a href="#calibre_link-24">85</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Monarchs, as embodiments of the nation, enjoy a certain immunity to envy</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wil  not carry over to Sovereign Individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The “losers and left-behinds” in the Information Society wil  surely envy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  resent  the  success  of  winners,  especial y  as  the  deepening  of  markets</p>
<p class="calibre1">implies that this wil  be increasingly a “winners take al ” world Increasingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rewards  are  already  coming  to  be  based  upon  relative  performance,  rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than absolute performance as was the case in industrial production. A factory</p>
<p class="calibre1">worker was paid either on the basis of hours in attendance as measured by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time  clock,  or  according  to  some  criterion  of  output,  such  as  pieces  made, </p>
<p class="calibre1">units  assembled  or  some  similar  measure<a href="#calibre_link-24">.86  </a>Standardized  pay  was  made</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible by the fact that output was similar for everyone using the same tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  creation  of  conceptual  wealth,  like  artistic  performance,  varies</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatical y among persons using the same tools. In this respect, the whole of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the economy is becoming increasingly like opera, where the highest rewards</p>
<p class="calibre1">go to those with the best voices, and those who sing out of tune, however</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnestly, do not normal y attract large rewards. As many  elds are opened to</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly  global  competition,  the  return  for  ordinary  performance  is  bound  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal . Middle talents wil  be in vast supply, some originating with persons who</p>
<p class="calibre1">can  rent  their  time  for  a  fraction  of  the  rates  that  prevail  in  the  leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  countries.  The  losers  wil   be  the  minor-league  out elders  with</p>

<p class="calibre1">liberation  and  personal  sovereignty  o ered  by  the  new  cybereconomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equal y, it is to be expected that the “left-behinds” wil  become increasingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">jingoistic and unpleasant as the impact of information technology grows in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  mil ennium.  It  is  di cult  to  guess  at  precisely  what  point  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">when Western nations begin to unambiguously crack apart in the manner of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the former Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equal y,  every  time  a  nation-state  cracks  up,  it  wil   facilitate  further</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution and encourage the autonomy of Sovereign Individuals. We expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">to see a signi cant multiplication of sovereign entities, as scores of enclaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">and jurisdictions more akin to city-states emerge from the rubble of nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  new  entities  wil   include  many  that  wil   o er  highly  competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">pricing of protection services, imposing low taxes or none at al  on income</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  capital.  The  new  entities  are  almost  bound  to  price  their  protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">services  more  attractively  than  do  the  leading  OECD  nation-states.  Seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply as a matter of market segmentation, the area of the market that is most</p>
<p class="calibre1">poorly served is the high-e ciency, low-cost end. Anyone who wishes to pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">high taxes in exchange for a complicated array of state spending has ample</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  to  do  so.  Therefore,  the  most  advantageous  and  pro table</p>

<p class="calibre1">e ciency, low-price alternative. Such a minisovereignty could only with great</p>
<p class="calibre1">di culty expect to provide a more complete array of services than those on</p>
<p class="calibre1">o er from the surviving nation-states. Since al  nation-states wil  certainly not</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse at once, the statist alternative is likely to be wel  supplied, especial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">early in the transition. On the other hand, a no-fril s regime of tolerable law</p>

<p class="calibre1">nation-state. These messages make it highly unlikely for you to forget “your</p>

<p class="calibre1">athletes compete in the Olympics. When they win, it is “our”  ag that waves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the ceremony. “Our” anthem brings the judges and other competitors to</p>

<p class="calibre1">narrow-casts  to  which  they  may  subscribe.  Much  the  same  e ect  wil   arise</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  the  privatization  of  education,  again  facilitated  by  technology.  In  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">corner of the mind’s life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The move to the Internet and the World Wide Web wil  also reduce the</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance of location in commerce. It wil  create individual addresses that</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  not  bounded  territorial y.  Satel ite-based  digital  telephone  services  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolve  beyond  location-based  land-line  systems  sharing  a  common</p>

<p class="calibre1">telephone address, like an Internet address, that wil  reach him wherever he</p>

<p class="calibre1">These  and  other  apparently  smal   steps  wil   help  free  the  ordinary</p>

<p class="calibre1">nation-state.  The  demysti cation  of  citizenship  wil   be  most  dramatical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerated  by  the  emergence  of  practical  alternatives  to  dealing  within</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounded  territories  monopolized  by  states.  The  building  blocks  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy&mdash;cybermoney,  cyberbanking,  and  an  unregulated  global</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybermarket  in  securities&mdash;are  almost  bound  to  come  into  existence  on  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large scale. As they do, the capacity of greedy governments to con scate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth of “citizens” wil  shrivel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  leading  states  wil   no  doubt  attempt  to  enforce  a  cartel  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserve  high  taxes  and  at  money  by  cooperating  to  limit  encryption  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent citizens from escaping their domains, the states wil  ultimately fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most productive people on the planet wil   nd their way to economic</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-362"></a>penned up where they can be physical y held to ransom. The ine ectiveness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of e orts to bar il egal immigrants convincingly shows that nation-states wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  unable  to  seal  their  borders  to  prevent  successful  people  from  escaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rich wil  be at least as enterprising in getting out as would-be taxi drivers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and waiters are at getting in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  rst  time  since  the  medieval  period  of  fragmented  sovereignty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">borders wil  not be clearly demarcated. As we explored earlier, there wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">no distinct territory in which many future  nancial transactions wil  occur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of accepting an inheritance of liabilities on the basis of an accident of</p>
<p class="calibre1">birth, increasing numbers of Sovereign Individuals wil  take advantage of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambiguity to desert their tax liabilities, moving beyond citizenship to become</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers.  They  wil   negotiate  private  tax  treaties  as  customers,  along  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines now available in Switzerland, as analyzed in Chapter 8. A typical private</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax  treaty  negotiated  with  the  French-speaking  Swiss  cantons  al ows  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual or family to reside in exchange for a  xed annual tax payment of</p>
<p class="calibre1">50,000 Swiss francs (currently about $45,000). Note that this is not a  at- <i class="calibre4">rate</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">tax, but a  at amount of tax  xed without respect to income. If your annual</p>
<p class="calibre1">income is 50,000 Swiss francs ($45,000), you should not enter into such a</p>
<p class="calibre1">private tax treaty because your tax rate would be 100 percent. At an income</p>
<p class="calibre1">of 500,000 Swiss francs, your rate is 10 percent. At SF5,000,000, the rate is</p>
<p class="calibre1">just 1 percent. At SF50 mil ion, your tax rate is just 1/10th of 1 percent. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">this seems an incredibly good deal compared to a marginal rate of 58 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  New  York  City,  that  is  merely  a  measure  of  how  predatory  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolistic the pricing of government services general y became during the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, 50,000 Swiss francs is an ample annual payment for the necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">and useful services of government. The Swiss surely make a large pro t from</p>
<p class="calibre1">serving  every  mil ionaire  who  moves  in  and  pays  them  50,000  Swiss  francs</p>
<p class="calibre1">annual y for the privilege. In many cases, the government’s marginal cost to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have  another  mil ionaire  living  in  the  jurisdiction  is  approximately  zero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  its  annual  pro t  on  the  transaction  wil   approach  50,000  Swiss</p>
<p class="calibre1">francs. Any service that can be undercut and stil  al ow the low-cost provider</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately  a  100  percent  pro t  is  monopolized  and  overpriced  to  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme. What is remarkable is not that the rate of tax charged should fal  as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">percentage  of  income  in  this  particular  case,  but  that  it  should  ever  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">349</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-350"></a>seemed “fair” that di erent persons should pay wildly di erent amounts for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the services of government during the twentieth century. This is particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">odd in that those who use government services the most pay the least, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who use them least pay the most. Al  of them wil  provide an advantage</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a domicile over the United States worth tens of mil ions over a lifetime to</p>
<p class="calibre1">any high-income American. Unless U.S. taxes are reformed to become more</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive with those of other jurisdictions, and are no longer levied on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">basis  of  nationality,  thinking  persons  wil   renounce  U.S.  citizenship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">notwithstanding  the  obstacles  imposed  by  Clinton’s  exit  tax,  to  take  up</p>
<p class="calibre1">passports that entail less onerous liabilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governments in the industrial era priced their services on the basis of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">success  of  the  taxpayer,  rather  than  in  relation  to  the  costs  or  value  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">services  provided.  The  movement  to  commercial  pricing  of  government</p>
<p class="calibre1">service wil  lead to more satisfactory protection at a far lower price than that</p>
<p class="calibre1">imposed by conventional nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Citizenship Goes the Way of Chivalry</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, citizenship is destined to go the way of chivalry. As the basis upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">which protection is provided is reorganized once again, the rationalizations</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  motivating  ideologies  that  complement  the  system  wil   also  inevitably</p>
<p class="calibre1">change. Half a mil ennium ago, at the close of the Middle Ages, when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">provision of protection in return for personal service general y ceased to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">paying  proposition,  people  responded  in  the  predictable  way.  They</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoned  chivalry.  Sworn  oaths  and  personal  fealty  ceased  to  be  taken  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously as they had been for the previous  ve centuries. Now information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology promises to be equal y subversive of citizenship. The nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  claims  of  nationalism  wil   be  demysti ed  just  as  the  claims  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly Church were demysti ed  ve centuries ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  reactionaries  wil   respond  by  attempting  to  vilify  innovators  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">revive  nationalist  sentiment,  we  doubt  that  the  megapolitical y  defunct</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state  can  exert  a  su ciently  strong  tug  of  loyalties  to  withstand  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive  pressures  unleashed  by  information  technology.  Most  thinking</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-359"></a>as customers of protection services, rather than be plundered as citizens of</p>

<p class="calibre1">The wealthy OECD countries impose heavy tax and regulatory burdens</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon individuals doing business within their borders. These costs may have</p>

<p class="calibre1">which one could do business and reside at a reasonable level of comfort. That</p>
<p class="calibre1">day has passed. The premium paid to be taxed and regulated as a resident of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the richest nation-states no longer repays its cost. It wil  be ever less tolerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">as  competition  between  jurisdictions  intensi es.  Those  with  the  earnings</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability and capital to meet the competitive chal enges of the Information Age</p>

<p class="calibre1">For  this  reason,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  one  or  more  nation-states  wil</p>

<p class="calibre1">This is not a problem that can be manipulated around the margins. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare state faces insolvency. Its  nancing predicament is even more acute in</p>

<p class="calibre1">&mdash;CHARLES TILLY</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">VIOLENCE IN PERSPECTIVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are at least two contending theories about what precipitates violence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions of change. Historian Charles Til y summarizes one theory: “[T]he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulus  to  col ective  violence  comes  largely  from  the  anxieties  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience  when  established  institutions  fal   apart.  If  misery  or  danger</p>
<p class="calibre1">compounds the anxiety, runs the theory, the reaction becomes al  the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent.”  In  Til y’s  view,  however,  violence  is  not  so  much  a  product  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“anxiety” as it is a far more rational attempt to bul y authorities into “meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">their responsibilities” motivated by a “sense of justice denied.” According to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Til y’s interpretation, “large structural changes” tend to stimulate col ective</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence of a “political” nature. “Instead of constituting a sharp break from</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘normal’  political  life,  furthermore,  violent  struggles  tend  to  accompany, </p>
<p class="calibre1">complement, and extend organized, peaceful attempts by the same people to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplish  their  objectives.  They  belong  to  the  same  world  as  nonviolent</p>
<p class="calibre1">contention. <a href="#calibre_link-24">”94</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever theory of violence is more correct, prospects for social peace</p>
<p class="calibre1">during the Great Transformation would appear to be limited. The col apse of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  nation-state  surely  counts  as  a  conspicuous  example  of  an  “established</p>
<p class="calibre1">institution fal ing apart.” Therefore, anxieties are likely to be in ful   ower, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">355</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-244"></a>wil  the political inspiration for violence. This could be especial y true in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading welfare states, where populations are accustomed to relative income</p>
<p class="calibre1">equality.  Given  that  populations  in  the  early  stages  of  the  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy wil  have come of age during the industrial period, when political</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities did have the capacity to answer grievances with material bene ts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it is reasonable to expect the “left-behinds” to continue to demand material</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ts.  It  wil   probably  take  a  slow,  painful  tutorial  in  the  realities  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybereconomy  before  OECD  populations  are  weaned  away  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectations of being able to compel income redistribution on a large scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In either case, whether violence arises from “anxiety” or as a more calculating</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ort  to  harness  the  bene ts  of  systematic  compulsion,  conditions  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear to make violence likely. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Constituencies of Losers</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The col apse of coerced income redistribution is bound to upset those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect to be on the receiving end of the tril ions in transfer programs. Mostly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">these  wil   be  “the  losers  or  left-behinds,”  persons  without  the  skil s  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compete in global markets. Like the pensioners of the former Soviet Union</p>
<p class="calibre1">who  formed  the  core  of  Zuganov’s  Communist  support,  the  disappointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">pensioners  of  the  dying  welfare  states  wil   form  a  reactionary  constituency</p>
<p class="calibre1">keen  to  prevent  the  sovereignty  of  the  nation-states  from  being  privatized, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thereby  depriving  the  state  of  its  license  to  steal.  As  they  realize  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  they  formerly  control ed  are  losing  their  sovereignty  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  and  the  ability  to  compel  large-scale  income  transfers,  they  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">become as adamant as French civil servants in  ghting arithmetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You may remember the violent reaction that greeted Prime Minister Alain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Juppe’s  quite  modest  proposals  to  scale  back  “demographical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsustainable”  retirement  bene ts  of  state  workers  and  economize  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations of the nationalized railroad system. Symbolic of the absurdity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  <i class="calibre4">État-Providence, </i> as the French cal  their social welfare system, is the rule</p>
<p class="calibre1">that al ows “engineers on the computerized, high-speed TGV trains to retire</p>
<p class="calibre1">at  age  fty,  just  like  their  predecessors  who  toiled  on  the  coal- red</p>
<p class="calibre1">locomotives.…” <a href="#calibre_link-25">95</a> A rowdy reaction to cutbacks of unsustainable bene ts is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinct  possibility  in  any  OECD  country.  And  even  where  populations</p>
<p class="calibre1">356</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-245"></a>respond  less  angrily,  you  can  expect  the  probable  losers  to  do  whatever  is within their power to forestal  the erosion of state compulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This wil  lead to some surprising twists. In the United States, for example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nativist  sentiment  has  historical y  been  tinged  with  more  than  a  slight</p>
<p class="calibre1">tincture of racism. This is a tradition that began with the nineteenth-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">“White  Caps”  and  Ku  Klux  Klan.  Yet  blacks,  as  a  group,  are  major</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ciaries  of  income  transfers,  a rmative  action,  and  other  fruits  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  compulsion.  They  are  also  disproportionately  represented  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.  military.  Therefore,  they  are  likely  to  emerge,  along  with  blue-col ar</p>
<p class="calibre1">whites, as among the most fervent partisans of American nationalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Politicians wil ing to cater to the insecurities of those whose relative talents</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal   wel   down  on  Ammon’s  turnip  wil   come  noisily  to  the  fore  in  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">every  country.  From  Slobodan  Milosevic  in  Serbia  to  Pat  Buchanan  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">United States to Winston Peters in New Zealand, to Necmettin Erbakan of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turkey’s fundamentalist Islamic Welfare Party, demagogues wil  rail against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the globalization of markets, immigration, and freedom of investment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Particular  animus  wil   be  directed  toward  the  rich  and  immigrants  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who imagine themselves to be the “global economy’s casualties.” In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">words of Andrew Heal, they wil  “depise the entry of immigrants whose main</p>
<p class="calibre1">entry  criterion  appears  to  be  their  wealth&mdash;or  their  lack  of  it,  which,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">specious logic goes, makes them welfare burdens. <a href="#calibre_link-25">”96</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Fear of Freedom</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  prospect  of  the  disappearance  of  the  nation-state  early  in  the  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium  seems  timed  to  e ect  the  maximum  disruption  in  the  lives  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestible people. This wil  lead to widespread unpleasantness. More than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few observers have recognized a pattern of reaction that is common among</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who feel left out by the prospect of a borderless world. As the larger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more  inclusive  national  grouping  begins  to  break  down,  with  the  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">mobile  “information  elite”  globalizing  their  a airs,  the  “losers  and  left-</p>
<p class="calibre1">behinds” fal  back upon membership in an ethnic subgroup, a tribe, a gang, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  or  linguistic  minority.  Partly,  this  is  a  practical  and  pragmatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaction  to  the  col apse  of  services,  including  law  and  order,  formerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided  by  the  state.  For  persons  with  few  marketable  resources,  it  often</p>
<p class="calibre1">357</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-246"></a>proves  di cult  to  purchase  access  to  market  alternatives  to  failed  public services. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The transformation of what were formerly treated as public goods, such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">education, provision of clean water, and neighborhood policing, into private</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods  is  obviously  easier  to  manage  for  those  with  su cient  resources  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchase high-quality private alternatives. For those wanting cash, however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the most practical alternative is often to depend upon kin, or join a mutual-</p>
<p class="calibre1">aid group organized along ethnic lines, like the old ethnic Chinese “Hokkien” </p>
<p class="calibre1">of Southeast Asia, or through a religious congregation. In those parts of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world where dynamic, proselytizing religions are active, part of the popularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  their  programs  depends  on  the  fact  that  they  tend  to  hark  back  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">premodern  mechanisms  for  providing  social  welfare  and  public  goods.  For</p>
<p class="calibre1">example, Moslem-led vigilante groups have played a leading role in combating</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent gangs in Cape Town, South Africa. <a href="#calibre_link-25">97</a> But as practical and pragmatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">as such ethnic and religious organization of help can be, more is involved in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the reactionary response to the withering of the state. There also seems to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a strong psychological component in the reaction against globalization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  argument  is  not  dissimilar  to  the  psychological  explanation  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeal of fascism developed by Erich Fromm in his famous work  <i class="calibre4">Escape from</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Freedom, </i>  rst  published  in  1941<a href="#calibre_link-25">.98  </a>According  to  Fromm,  social  mobility introduced  by  capitalism  had  destroyed  the  xed  identities  of  traditional</p>
<p class="calibre1">vil age life. The son of a farmer no longer knew that he would inevitably be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">farmer, or even that he would be bound to live scrabbling to harvest a crop on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same poor ground that his father til ed. He now had a broad choice of</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation. He could become a schoolteacher, a merchant, a soldier; study</p>
<p class="calibre1">medicine or take to the sea. Even as a farmer, he could emigrate to the United</p>
<p class="calibre1">States,  Canada,  or  Argentina  and  make  a  life  far  from  the  home  of  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">forebears.  This  freedom  that  capitalism  provided  to  people  “to  create  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own identities” proved scary to those who were not prepared to make creative</p>
<p class="calibre1">use of it. As Bil ig said, they yearned “for the security of a solid identity,” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">were “drawn towards the simplicities of nationalist and fascist propaganda,” <a href="#calibre_link-25">99</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Equal y as Bil ig writes of the twilight of the industrial era, “There is a global</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychology, which strikes the nation from above, withering loyalties with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">free play of identities. And then, there is the hot psychology of caste or tribe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">358</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-247"></a>which  hits  at  the  soft  underbel y  of  the  state  with  a  powerful y  intolerant commitment and emotional ferocity. <a href="#calibre_link-25">”100</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrew Heal views the same phenomenon from another perspective. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sees  two  great  “global  political  and  economic  trends.…  Trend  one  is  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth of the global economy.… The second is the rise of nationalist, ethnic</p>
<p class="calibre1">and regionalist sentiment, whether it be Maori, Scottish, Welsh or from anti-</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrant factions, who even as their governments push them towards new, </p>
<p class="calibre1">borderless  horizons,  pul   themselves  ever  so  hard  the  opposite  way. <a href="#calibre_link-25">”101</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">However  you  choose  to  look  at  them,  whether  as  major  “trends”  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“psychological themes,” it is clear that a strong reactionary sentiment in favor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of nationalism and against the fal  of borders and the deepening of markets is</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering its voice worldwide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MULTICULTURALISM AND VICTIMIZATION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In its twilight, with a faltering capacity to redeem promises of something for</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing from an empty pocket, the welfare state found it expedient to foster</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  myths  of  discrimination.  Many  categories  of  o cial y  “oppressed” </p>
<p class="calibre1">people were designated, especial y in North America. Individuals in groups</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  designated  status  as  “victims”  were  informed  that  they  were  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible for shortcomings in their own lives. Rather, the fault was said to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lie with “dead white males” of European descent, and the oppressive power</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure al egedly rigged to the disadvantage of the excluded groups. To be</p>
<p class="calibre1">black,  female,  homosexual,  Latino,  francophone,  disabled,  etc.  was  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entitled to recompense for past repression and discrimination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Lasch’s argument is to be believed, the purpose of heightening a sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  victimization  was  to  undermine  nations,  making  it  easier  for  the  new, </p>
<p class="calibre1">footloose  information  elite  to  escape  the  commitments  and  duties  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship. We are not entirely convinced that the new elite, especial y most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of those in the mass media, are cunning enough to reason to such a posture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would almost be reassuring to feel that they were. We see the growth of</p>
<p class="calibre1">victimization as mainly an attempt to buy social peace by not only widening</p>
<p class="calibre1">membership  in  the  meritocracy  as  Lasch  argues,  but  also  by  reconstituting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rationalizations for income redistribution. The new sport of victimology</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged in its most exaggerated form in North America because information</p>
<p class="calibre1">359</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-248"></a>technology  penetrated  more  deeply  there.  We  suspect,  however,  that  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">myths  of  discrimination  wil   be  common,  to  one  degree  or  another,  in  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  societies  in  their  senile  state.  The  multiethnic  welfare  states  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">North America were simply more vulnerable to the temptation to foist the</p>
<p class="calibre1">costs  of  income  redistribution  on  the  private  sector.  They  were  able  to  do</p>
<p class="calibre1">this,  while  in aming  a  sense  of  grievance  and  entitlement,  by  blaming  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure of society as a whole, and white men in general, for the economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">shortcomings of various subcultures within society. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Megapolitics of Innovation</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even before information technology began to threaten “creative destruction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the industrial economy, it had clearly antiquated much of the cherished</p>
<p class="calibre1">myth of Marxists and socialists. We examined the megapolitics of innovation</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  a  previous  chapter.  The  point  we  emphasized  there  is  of  importance  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">placing  the  social  impact  of  the  Information  Revolution  into  perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The precedent of technology expanding employment opportunities in recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries seems like a dependable rule of economic life, but it need not be. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  possible  for  earnings  to  be  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  a  prosperous</p>
<p class="calibre1">minority. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">REAL WAGES DROP BY 50 PERCENT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That is indeed what happened during the  rst two centuries or more of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern period. From the time of the Gunpowder Revolution around 1500</p>
<p class="calibre1">until 1700, real incomes for the bottom 60-80 percent of the population in</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of Western Europe fel  by 50 percent or more. <a href="#calibre_link-25">102 </a>In many places, real</p>
<p class="calibre1">income continued to fal  until 1750, and did not recover to 1500 levels until</p>
<p class="calibre1">1850. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike the experience of the past 250 years, the income gains of the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">half  of  the  modern  period,  a  time  of  dramatic  expansion  of  Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">European  economies,  were  concentrated  among  a  smal   minority.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">current  innovation  of  information  technologies  is  quite  di erent  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">innovation  of  industrial  technologies  that  the  world  experienced  in  recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries.  The  di erence  lies  in  the  fact  that  most  current  technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">360</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-249"></a>innovations with labor-saving characteristics tend to create skil ed tasks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduce  scale  economies.  This  is  the  opposite  of  the  experience  since  about</p>
<p class="calibre1">1750. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial innovation tended to open job opportunities for the unskil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  increase  the  scale  economies  of  enterprise.  This  not  only  raised  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnings  of  the  poor  without  any  e ort  on  their  part,  it  also  tended  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  the  power  of  political  systems,  making  them  more  capable  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">withstanding  unrest.  Those  who  were  displaced  by  mechanization  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">automation  in  the  early  phases  of  the  Industrial  Revolution  tended  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil ed artisans, craftsmen and journeymen, rather than unskil ed labor. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">was certainly true in the textile industry, the  rst to employ mechanization</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  power  equipment  on  a  large  scale,  which  led  to  a  violent  reaction  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luddites,  who  destroyed  textile  machinery  and  murdered  factory  owners</p>
<p class="calibre1">during  a  rampage  in  the  early  nineteenth  century.  On  the  other  hand,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fol owers  of  Captain  Swing,  the  mythical  leader  of  an  1830  rebel ion  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">southeastern England, were day laborers. Their demands included imposing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">levy on the local rich to provide them with money or beer, imposing a wage</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  upon  the  local  employers  of  day  labor,  and  “destroying,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanding the destruction of, new farm machinery, especial y threshers” that</p>
<p class="calibre1">reduced the cal  among farmers for rural day labor. <a href="#calibre_link-25">103</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary  to  the  romantic  jabberings  of  Marxists  and  others  who  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformed  the  violent  opponents  of  labor-saving  technology  into  heroes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they  were  an  unpleasant  and  violent  lot  who  opposed  the  introduction  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">While the violent fol owers of Ned Ludd and Captain Swing jeopardized</p>

<p class="calibre1">authority  their  movements  were  bound  to  miscarry.  The  poor,  unskil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority  were  unlikely  to  be  long  attracted  to  a  cause  that  promised  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy  machinery  that  o ered  them  jobs  and  also  raised  their  living</p>

<p class="calibre1">Over  the  past  two  centuries,  industrial  automation  dramatical y  raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">wages  for  unskil ed  work,  especial y  in  the  smal   part  of  the  world  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  rst  al owed  capitalism  to  ourish.  The  large  scale  of  advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial enterprise not only rewarded unskil ed labor with unprecedented</p>
<p class="calibre1">wages, it also facilitated income redistribution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  welfare  state  arose  as  a  logical  consequence  of  the  technology  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism. Because of their large scale and high capital costs, the leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial employers were the easiest targets to tax. And they could be relied</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon to keep records and enforce the garnishment of wages that made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">income tax technological y feasible as it had not been in previous centuries</p>
<p class="calibre1">when economies were more decentralized. The net e ect was that the growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  scale  economies  promoted  by  industrial  innovation  made  governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">richer, and presumably better able to maintain order. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Process Is Reversed</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In our judgment, the opposite is happening today. Information technology is</p>
<p class="calibre1">raising  earnings  opportunities  for  the  skil ed  and  undermining  institutions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that operate at a large scale, including the nation-state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  points  to  another  irony  of  the  Information  Age&mdash;namely,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">schizoid  and  fundamental y  obstructionist  attitude  of  critics  of  the  free</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  toward  the  rise  and  fal   of  industrial  jobs.  In  the  early  stages  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism, they were choked up about the supposed evil of industrial jobs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which lured landless peasants away from “the world we have lost.” To hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  critics  tel   it,  the  advent  of  factory  jobs  was  an  unprecedented  evil  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“exploitation” of the working class. But now it appears that the only thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse  than  the  advent  of  factory  jobs  is  their  disappearance.  The  great-</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandchildren of those who wailed about the introduction of factory jobs are</p>
<p class="calibre1">now wailing about the shortage of factory jobs that o er high pay for low-</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil ed work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">362</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-250"></a>The one coherent thread that runs through these complaints is a steadfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">resistance to technological innovation and market change. In the early stages</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the factory system, this resistance led to violence. It may again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  not  because  capitalists  are  “exploiting  the  workers.”  The  advent  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the computer as a paradigm technology revealed the absurdity of that claim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It might have been half-credible for the inattentive to suppose that a barely</p>
<p class="calibre1">literate auto worker had somehow been “exploited” in the production of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">automobile  by  owners  who  conceived  and  nanced  the  businesses  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed workers. The crucial role of conceptual capital in the production</p>
<p class="calibre1">and marketing of tangible products was less obvious than it is in the output</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Information Age, which clearly involves mental work. Therefore, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plausibility  of  the  assumption  that  entrepreneurs  had  somehow  seized  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">value  of  information  products  actual y  created  by  workers  was  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">diminished. Where the value was clearly created through mental work, as in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the production of consumer software, it was little short of preposterous to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose  that  it  was  actual y  the  product  of  anyone  other  than  the  skil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons who conceived it. In fact, far from assuming that the workers created</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  value, as Marxists and socialists did through most of the nineteenth and</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  centuries,  the  obvious  and  growing  trend  away  from  unskil ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">employment gave rise to a spreading worry about quite the opposite problem</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;whether unskil ed laborers stil  had any economic contribution to make. <a href="#calibre_link-25">104</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence the migration of the rationale for income redistribution away from</p>
<p class="calibre1">“exploitation,” which assumed a productive competence for those with low</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomes, to “discrimination,” which did not. “Discrimination,” however, was</p>
<p class="calibre1">al eged  to  account  for  the  failure  of  those  with  low  skil s  to  develop  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">valuable ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  discrimination  was  also  said  to  justify  imposition  of  nonoptimal</p>
<p class="calibre1">hiring  criteria  and  other  standards  for  opening  “opportunity,”  or,  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely, redistributing income to the lagging groups. In the United States, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for example, race-based norming of achievement and aptitude tests al owed</p>
<p class="calibre1">blacks  to  outscore  white  and  Asian  applicants  while  registering  lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective  scores.  Through  this  method  and  others,  governments  obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">employers  to  hire  more  blacks  and  other  o cial y  “victimized”  groups  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher wages than might otherwise have been the case. Anyone who failed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">363</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-302"></a>comply faced costly court actions, including lawsuits involving large punitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">damages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The point of designating victims was not to incubate paranoid delusions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  persecution  and  grievance  among  important  subgroups  of  industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">society,  or  to  subsidize  the  spread  of  counterproductive  values.  It  was  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">relieve  the  bankrupt  state  of  the  scal  pressures  of  redistributing  income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inculcating delusions of persecution was merely an unfortunate side e ect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironical y,  the  surge  in  concern  about  “discrimination”  coincided  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early  stages  of  a  technological  revolution  that  is  bound  to  make  actual</p>
<p class="calibre1">arbitrary discrimination far less of a problem than it has ever been before. No</p>
<p class="calibre1">one  on  the  Internet  knows  or  cares  whether  the  author  of  a  new  software</p>
<p class="calibre1">program is black, white, male, female, homosexual, or a vegetarian dwarf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the reality of discrimination is bound to be less oppressive in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future,  that  wil   not  necessarily  relieve  the  pressure  for  “reparations”  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compensate  various  real  or  imagined  wrongs.  Every  society,  whatever  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective circumstances, gives rise to one or more rationalizations for income</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution. They range from the subtle to the absurd, from the biblical</p>
<p class="calibre1">injunction  to  love  your  neighbor  as  yourself,  to  the  invocations  of  black</p>
<p class="calibre1">magic. Sorcery, witchcraft, and the evil eye are the  ip side of religious feeling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  spiritual  equivalent  of  the  Inland  Revenue  or  the  IRS.  When  people</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot be moved by love to subsidize the poor, the poor themselves wil  try to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see that they are moved by fear. Sometimes this takes the form of an outright</p>
<p class="calibre1">shakedown, a knife to the throat, a gun to the head. At other times, the threat</p>
<p class="calibre1">is disguised or fanciful. It is no coincidence that most of the “witches” of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early modern period were widows or unmarried women with few resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  terrorized  their  neighbors  with  curses  that  not  infrequently  moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">those neighbors to pay up. It is by no means obvious that those who did so</p>
<p class="calibre1">were only the superstitious. The malevolent intent of the evil eye was not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstition  but  a  fact.  Even  a  poor  woman  could  loose  cattle  or  set</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone’s  house  ablaze.  In  that  sense,  the  witchcraft  trials  of  the  early</p>
<p class="calibre1">modem period were not altogether so preposterous as they seem. While the</p>
<p class="calibre1">punishments  were  cruel  and  no  doubt  many  innocents  su ered  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hal ucinations  of  neighbors  under  the  in uence  of  ergot  poisoning,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosecution of witches can be understood as an indirect way of prosecuting</p>
<p class="calibre1">extortion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">364</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-251"></a>We  expect  a  return  of  extortion  motivated  by  a  desire  to  share  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewards  of  achievement  as  the  Information  Age  unfolds.  Groups  that  feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggrieved  over  past  discrimination  are  unlikely  to  quickly  relinquish  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently valuable status as victims simply because their claims on society</p>
<p class="calibre1">become less justi ed or harder to enforce. They wil  continue to press their</p>
<p class="calibre1">claims until evidence in the local environment leaves no doubt that they wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">no longer be rewarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  growth  of  sociopathic  behavior  among  Afro-Americans  and  Afro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Canadians  tel s  you  that.  It  says  that  there  is  little  balance  between  black</p>
<p class="calibre1">anger and a realistic appraisal of the extent to which black problems are self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">in icted consequences of antisocial behavior. Black anger has risen, even as</p>
<p class="calibre1">black lifestyles have grown more dysfunctional. Out-of-wedlock births have</p>
<p class="calibre1">soared.  Educational  attainment  has  fal en.  Growing  percentages  of  young</p>
<p class="calibre1">blacks are implicated in criminal activities, to the point where there are now</p>
<p class="calibre1">more black men in penitentiaries than in col eges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These perverse results may have had the temporary e ect of increasing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ow  of  resources  to  underclass  communities  during  the  twilight  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrialism by raising the shakedown threat against society as a whole. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the e ect could be only temporary. By eliminating the bene cial impact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition in chal enging underachievers to conform to productive norms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the welfare state has helped to create legions of dysfunctional, paranoid, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">poorly acculturated people, the social equivalent of a powder keg. The death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the nation-state and the disappearance of income redistribution on a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale  wil   no  doubt  lead  some  among  the  more  psychopathic  of  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhappy  souls  to  strike  out  against  anyone  who  appears  more  prosperous</p>
<p class="calibre1">than they. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that social peace wil  be in</p>

<p class="calibre1">Given past experience of antitechnological rebel ion in the early nineteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  and  the  long  tradition  of  col ective  violence  in  both  Europe  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">North America, no one should be surprised to see a neo-Luddite attack upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  technology  and  those  who  use  it.  The  Luddites,  referred  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier,  were  cloth  workers  concentrated  in  West  Yorkshire,  England,  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">launched a terrorist campaign against automated cropping machines and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory owners who adopted them in 1811-12<a href="#calibre_link-25">.106 </a>With blackened faces, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luddites  raged  through  West  Yorkshire,  burning  factories  and  murdering</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory owners who dared to adopt the new technology. Most of the violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">was the work of “croppers,” highly skil ed artisans whose labor in wielding</p>
<p class="calibre1">gigantic scissors weighing up to  fty pounds was previously a crucial part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  production  of  woolen  cloth.  But  the  nishing  work  that  the  croppers</p>
<p class="calibre1">performed, “raising the nap by teasels and cropping the cloth by shears,” was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as Robert Reid, author of the best and most comprehensive discussion of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luddite  rising,  <i class="calibre4">Land  of  Lost  Content:  The  Luddite  Revolt  1812, </i>  observed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“too simple not to be mechanized.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">107 </a>The design of one such mechanized</p>
<p class="calibre1">cropping  machine  had  been  sketched  out  by  Leonardo  da  Vinci.  Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leonardo’s design for automatic cropping languished for centuries. Final y, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  1787,  a  device  like  Leonardo’s  was  reinvented  and  brought  into</p>
<p class="calibre1">production in England. As Reid notes, “so long had al  the constituent parts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  technology  been  known  that  the  surprise  is  that  it  had  not  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced  earlier.…  The  new  equipment  of  the  Industrial  Revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">required so little strength and skil  to use that many job openings were taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  women  and  young  children,  initial y  at  low  wages.  One  of  these  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines,  even  operated  by  the  relatively  unskil ed,  could  now  crop  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighteen  hours  what  a  skil ed  cropper  using  hand  shears  took  eighty-eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours to do. <a href="#calibre_link-25">”108</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Note  that  the  workers  who  railed  at  mechanization  were  quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">discriminating  in  their  opposition  to  new  technology.  They  only  attacked</p>
<p class="calibre1">and fought those technologies that displaced their own jobs or reduced the</p>
<p class="calibre1">demand  for  skil ed  labor.  When  an  entrepreneur  named  Wil iam  Cooke</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced  carpet-weaving  machinery  into  the  West  Yorkshire  district,  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">sparked no violence whatever. No attempts were made to burn Cooke’s mil , </p>
<p class="calibre1">366</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-253"></a>or destroy his machinery, much less murder him. As Robert Reid explains in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  history  of  the  Luddite  uprisings,  Cooke’s  new  technology  excited  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposition because carpets were a product “in which no one in the val ey had</p>
<p class="calibre1">until then specialized.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">109 </a>Reid continues, “Because Cooke introduced a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">product  and  created  employment  founded  on  no  traditional  practices</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever,  his  mil   ourished.…” <a href="#calibre_link-25">110  </a>This  is  an  example  with  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">application for the future. It suggests that thinking entrepreneurs in the next</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium wil   rst introduce dramatic labor-saving automation in regions</p>
<p class="calibre1">without a tradition of producing whatever product or service is in question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the past is a guide, the most violent of the terrorists of the early decades</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the new mil ennium wil  not be homeless paupers but displaced workers</p>
<p class="calibre1">who formerly enjoyed middle-class incomes and status. This was certainly the</p>
<p class="calibre1">case in the Luddite uprising of 1812, in which the bulk of the Luddites were</p>
<p class="calibre1">not an impoverished proletariat but skil ed artisans who were accustomed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">earning incomes  ve times or more greater than those of an average worker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  equivalent  group  today  would  probably  be  displaced  factory  workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  scanning  the  demographics  of  most  OECD  countries,  one</p>
<p class="calibre1">nds  more  areas  than  not  that  could  be  highlighted  as  potential  sites  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world’s nation-states wil  seek to counteract the cybereconomy and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign  Individuals  who  are  able  to  take  advantage  of  it  to  accumulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth. A furious nationalist reaction wil  sweep the world. Part and parcel of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it wil  be an antitechonological reaction equivalent to the Luddite and other</p>
<p class="calibre1">antitechnology  rebel ions  in  Britain  during  the  Industrial  Revolution.  This</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  be  considered  closely,  because  it  could  be  a  key  to  the  evolution  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governance in the new mil ennium. One of the crucial chal enges of the great</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformation  ahead  wil   be  maintaining  order  in  the  face  of  escalating</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence,  or  alternatively  escaping  its  brunt.  Individuals  and  rms  that  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly  associated  with  the  advent  of  the  Information  Age,  including</p>
<p class="calibre1">those in Silicon Val ey, and even the suppliers of electricity required to power</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  new  technology,  wil   have  to  maintain  a  special  diligence  against  free-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lance, neo-Luddite terrorism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A lunatic like the Unabomber is unfortunately likely to stimulate brigades</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  imitators  as  frustration  with  fal ing  incomes  and  resentment  against</p>
<p class="calibre1">achievement mount. We suspect much of the violence to come wil  involve</p>
<p class="calibre1">367</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-254"></a>bombings. As reported in the  <i class="calibre4">New York Times</i>, domestic terrorism across the</p>

<p class="calibre1">percent in the last  ve years, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. The</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Defense Becomes a Private Good</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Notwithstanding  the  penal  taxes  imposed  by  nation-states  as  a  price  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection, they are unlikely to provide it e ectively in the years to come. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal ing scale of violence implied by the new information technology makes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">provision of a massive military establishment far less useful. This implies not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only a declining decisiveness in warfare, meaning that states wil  be less able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y  protect  citizens,  it  also  implies  that  the  apparent  extraterritorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">hegemony of the United States as the world’s superpower wil  be less e ective</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the next century than the hegemony of Great Britain was in the nineteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century.  Until  the  onset  of  World  War  I,  power  could  be  e ectively  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">decisively projected from the core to the periphery at relatively low cost. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twenty- rst century, the threats that major powers pose to the safety of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life and property wil  necessarily diminish with the return to violence. Fal ing</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns to violence suggest that nation-states or empires capable of exercising</p>
<p class="calibre1">military power on a large scale are unlikely to survive or come into being in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the  scal requirement for provision of an adequate defense fal s, it wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">become ever more credible to treat protection services as if they were private</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods.  After  al ,  security  threats  on  a  diminished  scale  wil   be  increasingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensible by security forces of the kind that can be engaged commercial y, </p>
<p class="calibre1">such  as  by  employing  wal s,  fences,  and  security  perimeters  to  screen  out</p>
<p class="calibre1">troublemakers. Further, a wealthy individual or  rm may be able to a ord to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hire  protection  against  most  threats  that  would  be  likely  to  arise  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age. At the margin, the diminished scale of military threats wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase  the  danger  of  anarchy,  or  competitive  violence  within  a  single</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory.  But  it  wil   also  intensify  competition  among  jurisdictions  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">368</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-351"></a>provision  of  protection  on  competitive  terms.  This  wil   mean  intensi ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">shopping among jurisdictions for protection services, passport and consular</p>
<p class="calibre1">services, and the provision of justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the long run, of course, Sovereign Individuals wil  probably be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel on nongovernmental documents, issued like letters of credit by private</p>
<p class="calibre1">agencies and a nity groups. It is not farfetched to suppose that a group wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerge  as  a  kind  of  merchant  republic  of  cyberspace,  organized  like  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medieval  Hanseatic  League,  to  facilitate  negotiation  of  private  treaties  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">contracts  among  jurisdictions  as  wel   as  to  provide  protection  for  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">members.  Imagine  a  special  passport  issued  by  the  League  of  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals,  identifying  the  holder  as  a  person  under  the  protection  of  the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Such  a  document,  if  it  comes  into  existence,  wil   be  only  a  temporary</p>
<p class="calibre1">artifact of the transition away from the nation-state and the bureaucratic age</p>
<p class="calibre1">it fostered. Before the modern period, passports were general y unnecessary to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass frontiers, which were loosely de ned in most cases. While letters of safe</p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct were sometimes employed in medieval frontier societies, they were</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal y issued by the authorities whose realm was to be visited, rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the jurisdiction from which the traveler originated. More important than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">passport were letters of introduction and credit, which al owed a traveler to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nd  lodging  and  negotiate  business.  That  day  wil   come  again.  Ultimately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">persons of substance wil  be able to travel without documents at al . They wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be able to identify themselves on a foolproof biometric basis through voice-</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognition systems or retinal scanning that recognizes them uniquely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, we expect that sometime in the  rst half of the next century the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  wil   experience  the  genuine  privatization  of  sovereignty.  This  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompany  conditions  that  could  be  expected  to  shrivel  the  realm  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">compulsion  to  its  logical  minimum.  Yet  to  the  secular  inquisitors  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reactionaries  of  the  next  mil ennium,  the  placing  of  the  once  “sacred” </p>
<p class="calibre1">attributes  of  nationality  onto  a  market  footing  to  be  bought  and  sold  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter of cost-bene t calculation wil  be both infuriating and threatening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We argue in this book that it wil  no longer take a nation-state to  ght an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information War. Such wars could be undertaken by computer programmers</p>
<p class="calibre1">deploying  large  numbers  of  “bots”  or  digital  servants.  Bil   Gates  already</p>
<p class="calibre1">possesses  a  greater  capacity  to  detonate  logic  bombs  in  vulnerable  systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">369</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-30"></a>global y than most of the world’s nation-states. In the age of the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">War, any software company, or even the Church of Scientology, would be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  formidable  antagonist  than  the  accumulated  threat  posed  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority of the states with seats in the United Nations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This loss of power by nation-states is a logical consequence of the advent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of low-cost, advanced computational capacity. Microprocessing both reduces</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns to violence and creates for the  rst time a competitive market for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection services for which governments charged monopoly prices in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the new world of commercialized sovereignty, people wil  choose their</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions,  much  as  many  now  choose  their  insurance  carriers  or  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">religions. <a href="#calibre_link-21">V  </a>Jurisdictions  that  fail  to  provide  a  suitable  mix  of  services, whatever  those  may  be,  wil   face  bankruptcy  and  liquidation,  just  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">incompetent  commercial  enterprises  or  failed  religious  congregations  do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Competition  wil   therefore  mobilize  the  e orts  of  local  jurisdictions  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve their capacity to provide services economical y and e ectively. In this</p>
<p class="calibre1">respect,  competition  between  jurisdictions  in  providing  public  goods  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a similar impact to that observed in other sectors of life. Competition</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual y improves customer satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">COMPETITION AND ANARCHY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is important to bear in mind that the competition between, jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we anticipate is not mainly competition among organizations employing</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence in the same territory. As indicated earlier, competitive organizations</p>
<p class="calibre1">using violence tend to increase the penetration of violence in life, reducing</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic opportunity. As Lane put it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  use  of  violence  there  were  obviously  great  advantages  of  scale  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">competing  with  rival  violence-using  enterprises  or  establishing  a  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly.  This  fact  is  basic  for  the  economic  analysis  of  one  aspect  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government:  the  violence-using,  violence-control ing  industry  was  a  natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly,  at  least  on  land.  Within  territorial  limits  the  service  it  rendered</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be produced much more cheaply by a monopoly. To be sure, there have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been times when violence-using enterprises competed in demanding payments</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  protection  in  almost  the  same  territory,  for  example,  during  the  Thirty</p>
<p class="calibre1">370</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-255"></a>Years’ War in Germany. But such a situation was even more uneconomic than</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  be  competition  in  the  same  territories  between  rival  telephone</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems. <a href="#calibre_link-25">112</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane’s  comment  is  informative  in  two  respects.  Firstly,  we  agree  with  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">general  conclusion  that  sovereignties  wil   tend  to  exercise  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopolies  because  doing  so  wil   al ow  them  to  o er  cheaper  and  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective  protection  services.  The  second  interesting  aspect  of  Lane’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">comment  is  his  dated  comparison  with  monopoly  telephone  service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,  we  now  know  that  telephone  systems  need  not  be  monopolies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  introduces  a  caution  into  the  analysis.  Changes  in  technological</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions may to some extent obviate the general conclusion that anarchy</p>
<p class="calibre1">within territorial limits is nonviable. For example, if cyberassets grow to large</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale in a realm that puts them outside the reach of compulsion, the pricing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of protection services may be much less a matter of “demand” and more a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter of market negotiation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, what we refer to here is something di erent from generalized</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy&mdash;namely,  competition  among  jurisdictions,  each  enjoying  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly  of  violence  in  its  own  territory.  We  see  such  jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">competing to o er the greatest value possible in the cost-e ective provision of</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection services that appeal to their “customers.” Admittedly, there wil  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt  be  greater  ambiguities  in  the  provision  of  protection  services  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age,  with  more  complete  private  provision  of  policing  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">defense  services  than  we  have  been  accustomed  to  seeing  before.  Yet  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  we  envision  is  di erent  from  a  clash  of  multiple  protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">agencies battling on a large scale to provide service to di erent customers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same territory, which is  <i class="calibre4">anarchy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Be  that  as  it  may,  the  multiplication  of  sovereignties,  with  individuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">assuming  more  of  the  role  of  sovereigns  in  cases  when  they  accumulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">su cient  resources,  inevitably  implies  that  there  wil   be  an  increase  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scope for anarchy in the world. The relations between sovereignties are always</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchic. There is not and never has been a world government regulating the</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior  of  individual  sovereignties,  whether  ministates,  nation-states,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">empires.  As  Jack  Hirshleifer  writes,  “[W]hile  associations  ranging  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive tribes to modern nation-states are al  governed internal y by some</p>
<p class="calibre1">form  of  law,  their  external  relations  with  one  another  remain  mainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">371</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-256"></a>anarchic.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">113</a> When there are more sovereign entities in the world, inevitably more  relations  transpire  in  more  than  one  jurisdiction  and  are  therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is important to note that anarchy, or the lack of an overwhelming power</p>
<p class="calibre1">to arbitrate disputes, is not synonymous with total chaos or the absence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">form  or  organization.  Hirshleifer  notes  that  anarchy  can  be  analyzed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“intertribal or international systems also have their regularities and systematic</p>
<p class="calibre1">analyzable patterns.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">114</a> In other words, just as “chaos” in mathematics can</p>
<p class="calibre1">entail an intricate and highly ordered form of organization, so “anarchy” is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not entirely formless or disordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hirshleifer  analyzes  a  number  of  anarchic  settings.  These  include,  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">addition  to  relations  among  sovereignties,  gang  warfare  in  Prohibition-era</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicago and “miners versus claim jumpers in the California gold rush.” Note</p>
<p class="calibre1">that even though California was part of the United States by the onset of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold  rush  in  1849,  conditions  in  the  gold elds  were  properly  described  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy.  As  Hirshleifer  notes,  “[T]he  o cial  organs  of  law  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">impotent. <a href="#calibre_link-25">”115</a> He argues that topographical conditions in the mountainous</p>
<p class="calibre1">camps,  plus  e ective  vigilante  organization  by  miners  to  combat  claim</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumpers, made it di cult for gangs of outsiders to seize gold mines, in spite of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  lack  of  e ective  law  enforcement.  In  other  words,  under  certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions, valuable property can be e ectively protected even under anarchy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The question is whether Hirshleifer’s theoretical analysis of the dynamics</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  spontaneous  order  of  the  Darwinian  “natural  economy”  is  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">relevance to the economy of the Information Age. We suspect it is. While we</p>
<p class="calibre1">do not anticipate generalized anarchy, or gold eld conditions everywhere, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">do  anticipate  an  increase  in  the  number  of  anarchic  relations  in  the  world</p>
<p class="calibre1">system. In light of this expectation, Hirshleifer’s argument about conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">under which “two or more anarchic contestants” can “retain viable shares of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the social y available resources in equilibrium” is suggestive. <a href="#calibre_link-25">116 </a>In particular, he  explores  when  anarchy  is  prone  to  “break  down”  into   <i class="calibre4">tyranny</i>  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominance  hierarchies,  which  happens  when  the  anarchic  parties  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">subdued by an overwhelming authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  issues  may  be  more  important  to  understand  in  the  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age than they were in the Industrial Age. Part of the reason that the  ner</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctions  about  the  dynamics  of  anarchy  were  less  crucial  in  recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">372</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-257"></a>centuries than they may be in the new mil ennium is precisely because the</p>
<p class="calibre1">returns to violence were rising through the modern period. This meant that</p>
<p class="calibre1">massing  larger  and  larger  military  forces,  as  nation-states  did  in  recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries,  tended  to  make  for  decisive  warfare.  Decisive  warfare,  almost  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">de nition,  subdues  anarchy  by  placing  contestants  for  the  control  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources under the domination of a more powerful authority. On the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand, declining decisiveness in battle, which corresponds to the superiority of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  defense  in  military  technology,  contributes  to  the  dynamic  stability  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy.  Therefore,  the  apparent  impact  of  information  technology  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">reducing the decisiveness of military action should make the anarchy between</p>
<p class="calibre1">minisovereignties more stable and less prone to be replaced through conquest</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  a  large  government.  Less  decisiveness  in  battle  also  implies  less  ghting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which is an encouraging deduction for the world in the Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Viability</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  important  condition  for  anarchy  to  be  sustained  is  viability  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">income adequacy. Individuals who lack a su cient income to sustain life are</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely either to (1) devote a great deal of e ort to  ghting in order to seize</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough  resources  to  survive,  or  (2)  capitulate  to  another  contestant  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">exchange for food and sustenance. Something similar to this occured with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rise  of  feudalism  during  the  transformation  of  the  year  1000.  We  expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing  numbers  of  low-income  persons  in  Western  countries  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously would have depended upon transfer payments from the state to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a liate with wealthy households as retainers. Nonetheless, the mere fact of</p>
<p class="calibre1">inviability by some contenders in a Hobbesian melee (or war of al  against al )</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  inconclusive.  As  Hirshleifer  says,  “[T]he  mere  fact  of  low  income  under</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy,… of itself provides no clear indication as to what is likely to happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">next.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">117</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Character of Assets</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Stil   another  interesting  condition  for  the  sustainability  of  anarchy  is  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources  be  “predictable  and  defendable.”  In  Hirshleifer’s  analysis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“[A]narchy is a social arrangement in which contenders struggle to conquer</p>
<p class="calibre1">373</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-258"></a>and defend durable resources.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">118</a> He de nes “durable resources” to include</p>
<p class="calibre1">“land territories or movable capital goods.” <a href="#calibre_link-25">119</a> In the Information Age, digital resources  may  prove  to  be  predictable,  but  they  wil   not  be  “durable</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources”  of  the  kind  that  Hirshleifer  identi es  with  territoriality  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy. Indeed, if digital money can be transferred anywhere on the planet at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  speed  of  light,  conquest  of  the  territory  in  which  a  cyberbank  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporated  may  be  a  waste  of  time.  Nation-states  wishing  to  suppress</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sovereign Individuals  would  have  to  seize  simultaneously  both  the  world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">banking  havens  and  its  data  havens.  Even  then,  if  encrypted  systems  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">designed properly, nation-states would merely be able to sabotage or destroy</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain sums of digital money, not seize it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conclusion is that the most predictable and vulnerable assets of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich in the coming Information Age may be their physical persons&mdash;in other</p>
<p class="calibre1">words, their lives. Which is why we fear Luddite-style terrorism in the coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades, some of it perhaps covertly encouraged by agents provocateurs in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">employ of nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the long term, however, we doubt that the leading nation-states wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed in suppressing Sovereign Individuals. For one tiling, existing states, </p>
<p class="calibre1">especial y  in  capital-poor  regions,  wil   nd  that  they  have  more  to  gain  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">harboring  Sovereign  Individuals  than  by  maintaining  solidarity  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">North  Atlantic  nation-states  and  upholding  the  sanctity  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“international” system. The fact that bankrupt, high-tax welfare states want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  keep  “their  citizens”  and  “their  capital”  in  “their  country”  wil   not  be  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">compel ing motive to be observed by hundreds of fragmenting sovereignties</p>
<p class="calibre1">elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  say  this,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  there  are  thousands  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">multinational organizations designed to condition the behavior of the world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">various  sovereignties.  There  can  be  little  doubt  that  some  of  these</p>
<p class="calibre1">organizations, like the European Union and the World Bank, are in uential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  remember  that  the  jurisdictions  that  make  Sovereign  Individuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcome stand to bene t signi cantly from their presence. Even a pigheaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  like  the  United  States,  which  is  bound  by  current  trends  to  work</p>
<p class="calibre1">vigorously to prevent the emergence of a cybereconomy outside the control</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the U.S. government, wil  ultimately not wish to exclude those residents of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the globe with positive bank balances who do not wish to be Americans. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">374</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-443"></a>is  especial y  likely  inasmuch  as  shopping  is  now  a  major  fascination  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">travelers.  Ultimately,  although  wel   after  others,  the  United  States,  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragments thereof, wil  join in the commercialization of sovereignty because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of competitive pressures. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Demand Creates Supply</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Those pressures wil  be felt more vigorously early on in nation-states with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakest balance sheets. Among the new “o shore” centers wil  be fragments</p>
<p class="calibre1">and enclaves of current nation-states, like Canada and Italy, which wil  almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">surely disintegrate wel  before the end of the  rst quarter of the twenty- rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">century.  The  birth  of  a  global  market  for  high-quality,  cost-e cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdictions  wil   help  bring  such  jurisdictions  into  being.  As  in  ordinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce,  smal -scale  competitors  wil   be  more  nimble  and  better  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compete. The thinly populated jurisdiction can more easily structure itself to</p>
<p class="calibre1">operate e ciently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The information elite wil  seek high-quality protection on contract for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasonable fee. While this fee wil  fal  wel  short of what would be required to</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribute a noticeable bene t to the whole populations of nation-states as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  are  now  structured,  with  tens  of  mil ions  to  hundreds  of  mil ions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens, it would not be trivial in a jurisdiction with a population in the tens</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  thousands  or  hundreds  of  thousands.  The  tax  payments  and  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  advantages  accruing  from  the  presence  of  a  smal   number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceedingly  rich  individuals  imply  a  far  higher  per  capita  bene t  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction with a smal  rather than a huge population. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since it wil  be practical y immaterial where one domiciles his businesses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except  in  the  purely  negative  sense  that  some  addresses  wil   imply  higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">liabilities than others, smal  jurisdictions wil   nd it easier to set commercial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful  terms  for  protection.  Therefore,  jurisdictions  with  smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">populations  wil   enjoy  a  decided  advantage  in  formulating  a  scal  policy</p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive to Sovereign Individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We believe that the age of the nation-state is over, but this is not to say that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  attraction  of  nationalism  as  a  tug  on  human  emotions  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately quieted. As an ideology, nationalism is wel  placed to draw upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">universal emotional needs. We have al  had the experience of awe, such as one</p>
<p class="calibre1">375</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-21"></a>might feel on  rst seeing a giant waterfal , or  rst standing at the entrance to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great cathedral. We have al  had the experience of belonging, such as we might</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel at a family Christmas party, or as a member of a successful team in some</p>
<p class="calibre1">sport.  Human  culture  cal s  for  a  response  to  both  of  these  powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotions.  We  are  il uminated  by  the  historic  culture  of  our  own  country, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which is itself part of the larger culture of humanity. We are comforted by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge that we belong to a cultural group, which gives us both a sense of</p>
<p class="calibre1">participation and of identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  impact  of  these  cultural  symbols  can  have  the  strongest  emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ect. The American associations of the Flag, the National Anthem, or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">family feast at Thanksgiving Day, the English associations of the monarchy or</p>
<p class="calibre1">cricket&mdash;al   have  a  real  hold  on  the  imaginations  of  American  and  English</p>
<p class="calibre1">people, respectively, a hold that is reinforced by repetition and goes deep into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the subconscious mind. Such symbols help to tel  us what sort of people we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are,  and  remind  us  of  a  national  culture.  When  anti&mdash;Vietnam  War</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrators wanted to shock the rest of the United States, they burned the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ag. Alienated English attack the monarchy, and have even been known to</p>
<p class="calibre1">dig holes in cricket pitches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These  trigger  points  are  super cial,  but  not  unimportant.  They  are  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">associations  we  were  taught  to  bleed  for.  Whatever  the  change  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical  conditions  or  resulting  change  in  institutions,  they  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably remain important in the imaginations of persons who came of age, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as we did, in the twentieth century. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It  is  no  secret  that  democracy  has  been  relatively  rare  and,  eeting  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">history  of  governments.  In  those  times,  ancient  and  modem,  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy has prevailed, it has depended for its success upon megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions that reinforced the military power and importance of the masses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historian Carrol  Quigley explored these characteristics in  <i class="calibre4">Weapons Systems</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and Political Stability. </i><a href="#calibre_link-31">2 T</a>hey have included:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. <b class="calibre3">Cheap  and  widely  dispersed  weaponry. </b>  Democracy  tends  to  ourish</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the cost to purchase useful weapons is low. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. <b class="calibre3">Weapons that can be used e ectively by amateurs. </b> Democracy is more</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely when anyone can use e ective weapons without extended training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. <b class="calibre3">A military advantage for a large number of participants on foot in</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">battle. </b> As Quigley points out, “[P]eriods of infantry dominance have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">periods in which political power has been more widely dispersed within the</p>
<p class="calibre1">community and democracy has had a better chance to prevail. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is hardly a comprehensive catalogue of the conditions under which</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy  can  exist.  If  it  were,  democracy  would  not  have  become  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumpliant  system  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century.  Weapons  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">377</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-498"></a>arguably more expensive in the twilight of the industrial era than ever. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">many of the most e ective weapons de nitely required specialists to be used</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ectively. Furthermore, the Gulf War between the United States, its al ies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and Iraq proved how vulnerable large contingents of infantry are, even when</p>
<p class="calibre1">nestled in trenches and dug-in forti cations. So why has democracy appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  ourish under these conditions as the twentieth century winds down? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">DEMOCRACY, THE FRATERNAL TWIN OF COMMUNISM? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We o ered a paradoxical explanation in Chapter 5, namely that democracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourished as a fraternal twin of Communism precisely because it facilitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">unimpeded control of resources by the state. This conclusion may seem sil y</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the Manchichaean “common sense” of the industrial era. We do not deny</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  within  the  terms  of  industrial  society,  democratic  systems  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communism were stark opposites. But seen from a megapolitical perspective, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as they may more likely be seen from the vantage of the Information Age, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two systems had more in common than, you would have been led to suspect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  a  setting  where  weaponry  was  grotesquely  expensive,  democracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">became the decision mechanism that maximized control of resources by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state. Like state socialism, democratic systems made available huge sums to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fund a massive military establishment. The di erence was that the democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of the state than could</p>
<p class="calibre1">the state socialist systems. That is saying something, because the state socialist</p>
<p class="calibre1">or Communist systems laid claim to practical y every asset worth having. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seen dispassionately, democracy was superior to state socialism as a recipe</p>
<p class="calibre1">for enriching the state. As we explained earlier, democracy made substantial y</p>
<p class="calibre1">more money available to the military because democracy was compatible with</p>
<p class="calibre1">private ownership and capitalist productivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state</p>
<p class="calibre1">owned  everything.  The  democratic  welfare  state,  by  contrast,  made  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">limited initial claims. It pretended to al ow private ownership, although of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">contingent  kind,  and  thereby  harnessed  superior  incentives  to  mobilize</p>
<p class="calibre1">output.  Instead  of  mismanaging  everything  from  the  start,  democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  in  the  West  al owed  individuals  to  own  property  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">378</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-372"></a>accumulate  wealth.  Only  after  the  wealth  had  been  created  did  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic nation-states step in to tax a large fraction of it away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The word “Large” should be capitalized. For example, in 1996 the lifetime</p>
<p class="calibre1">federal tax rate at the highest brackets in the United States stood at seventy-</p>
<p class="calibre1">three  cents  on  the  dol ar.  For  owners  of  corporations,  who  received  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">income through dividends, the rate was eighty-three cents on the dol ar. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">for anyone who sought to leave or give wealth to grandchildren, the federal</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax rate was ninety-three cents on the dol ar. When state and local taxes are</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered as wel , democratic government at al  levels con scates the lion’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">share of each dol ar earned in the United States. Predatory tax rates made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic state a  <i class="calibre4">de facto</i> partner with a three-quarters to nine-tenths share</p>
<p class="calibre1">in earnings. This was not the same thing as state socialism, to be sure. But it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a close relation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  democratic  state  survived  longer  because  it  was  more  exible  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">col ected more prodigious quantities of resources compared to those available</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Moscow or East Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Inefficiency, Where It Counted” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We have described the megapolitical advantages of democracy as a decision</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule  for  a  powerful  government  as  “ine ciency,  where  it  counted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to Communism, the welfare state was indeed a far more e cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.  But  compared  to  a  genuine  laissez-faire  enclave  like  colonial  Hong</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kong,  the  welfare  state  was  ine cient.  Growth  rates  in  Hong  Kong  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabulous,  but  their  superiority  lay  precisely  in  the  fact  that  the  resident  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hong  Kong,  not  the  government,  was  able  to  pocket  85  percent  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ts of faster growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hong  Kong,  of  course,  was  never  a  democracy.  Indeed,  it  is  a  mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">model  of  the  kind  of  jurisdiction  that  we  expect  to  see  ourish  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age.  In  the  Industrial  Age,  Hong  Kong  had  no  need  to  be  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy, as it was spared the unpleasant necessity of gathering resources to</p>
<p class="calibre1">support a formidable military establishment. Hong Kong was defended from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the outside, so it could a ord to maintain a real y free economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  precisely  the  capacity  to  rake  in  resources  that  made  democracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">supreme  during  the  megapolitical  conditions  of  the  Industrial  Age.  Mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">379</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-260"></a>democracy went hand in hand with industrialism. As Alvin To er has said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mass  democracy  “is  the  political  expression  of  mass  production,  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution,  mass  consumption,  mass  education,  mass  media,  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertainment, and al  the rest. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”4</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  that  information  technology  is  displacing  mass  production,  it  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">logical  to  expect  the  twilight  of  mass  democracy.  The  crucial  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperative that made mass democracy triumph during the Industrial Age has</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared. It is therefore only a matter of time until mass democracy goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way of its fraternal twin, Communism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Mass Democracy Incompatible with the Information Age</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment’s re ection shows that the technology of the Information Age is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not inherently a mass technology. In military terms, as we have indicated, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">opens the potential for “smart weapons” and “Information War,” in which</p>
<p class="calibre1">“logic  bombs”  could  sabotage  centralized  command  and  control  systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only does information technology clearly point toward the perfection of</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons  operated  by  specialists;  it  also  reduces  the  decisiveness  of  warfare, </p>
<p class="calibre1">improving  the  relative  position  of  the  defense.  Microtechnology  makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible dramatic gains in the military power of individuals, while reducing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  importance  of  massed  infantry  formations.  As  the  Rand  Corporation</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported  to  the  secretary  of  defense:  “Interconnected  networks  may  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject to attack and disruption not just by states but also by nonstate actors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including dispersed groups and even individuals. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”5</a> What is more, this implies</p>
<p class="calibre1">that cyberwar wil  realize the potential diseconomies to scale inherent in mass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">centralized systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the words of the Rand experts, “Information-based techniques render</p>
<p class="calibre1">geographical distance irrelevant; targets in the continental United States are</p>
<p class="calibre1">just  as  vulnerable  as  in-theatre  targets. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”6</a>  Whereas  there  used  to  be  safety implied in residence within the boundaries of large, superpower nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">like the United States, in the Information Age the logic of aggregating power</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be reversed. Peoria may be far from any potential military front, but it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  no longer be safe from cyberattack by almost any potential antagonist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Residing  within  the  borders  of  a  superpower  wil   mean  putting  yourself</p>
<p class="calibre1">within the bul ’s-eye. Instead of federating, locales may make themselves more</p>
<p class="calibre1">380</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-421"></a>secure  by  disaggregating.  The  advent  of  cyberwar  wil   increase  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerability of centralized command-and-control systems, while increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the competitive viability of dispersed systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  feedback  mechanisms  this  wil   stimulate  could  accelerate  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolutionary  process.  As  the  Rand  experts  suggest,  in  order  to  lessen  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerability to cyberattack of the command-and-control systems that have</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolved during the late stages of the nation-state, governments wil  be obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">to increase “the exploitation of new software encryption techniques.” This</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  make these mainly private-sector systems far less vulnerable to sabotage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while accelerating the commercial dispersion of hard encryption, which wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">help  free  them  from  state  domination.  This,  too,  wil   give  impetus  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution.  As  we  argued  earlier,  it  wil   further  propel  the  dispersion  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources into cyberspace, where they wil  be beyond the reach of politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,  this  means  the  end  of  mass  democracy,  especial y  in  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">predominant form, representative misgovernment, either of the congressional</p>
<p class="calibre1">or parliamentary type. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE MEGAPOLITICS OF MISREPRESENTATION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When  megapolitical  conditions  change  in  a  big  way,  as  they  are  changing</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, the organization of government inevitably changes as wel . In fact, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">form  of  representative  government  has  traditional y  been  an  artifact  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution of raw power. This is shown by the very fact that representatives</p>
<p class="calibre1">are chosen on a geographic basis, rather than in some other way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think about it. In principle, a legislature would be just as representative if</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  members  were  chosen  according  to  any  arbitrary  division  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">population. Parliamentary ridings or congressional districts could be based on</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthdays, or even alphabetical constituencies. Everyone born on January 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  vote  from  one  list  of  candidates.  Those  born  on  January  2  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">another. Or every person whose name began with “Aa” to “AT” could choose</p>
<p class="calibre1">among  one  list  of  candidates.  Those  whose  names  began  with  “Ag”  would</p>
<p class="calibre1">chose among another. And so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No such system exists now for several reasons. A  rst and su cient reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">is that it was technological y impractical in the eighteenth century. But even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more important is the fact that birthday or alphabetical constituencies would</p>
<p class="calibre1">381</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-261"></a>not have re ected or even approximated the distribution of raw power that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  vote  had  to  manifest  at  that  time.  Persons  who  shared  no  more  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthdays or the  rst few letters of their names in common would have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">and stil  would be extremely hard to organize into any coherent power base. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Why Do Geographic Cross Sections Count More? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The vote real y did begin as a proxy for a military contest. And so it remains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if only in a veiled way. Such contests can be organized along geographic lines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and more rarely, along kinship or religious lines. They cannot be organized on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the basis of birthdays or  rst initials. Nor can they be organized e ectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">according  to  occupations,  except  where  occupations  are  con ned  within</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereditary guilds, like the castes in India, or cluster local y the way farmers do</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Iowa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  whole  point  of  current  formulas  of  representation  is  that  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">mobilize interests that are vested geographical y, rather than along some other</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimension. Historical y, the key to military success was to control territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al  military threats have formed local y. Representative systems are geared to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide a di erent venue for the expression of that power. The fact that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably tend to promote local vested interests is an artifact of the formula</p>
<p class="calibre1">of representation. Geographic constituencies induce representatives to target</p>
<p class="calibre1">favors  for  special  groups  at  the  expense  of  the  common  interests  that  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">residents of a country share. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">New Possibilities Ahead</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As analysis by Public Choice economists has shown, apparently minor shifts</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the way an election is structured, or the way the vote is calculated, have</p>
<p class="calibre1">large  and  predictable  consequences  in  altering  the  outcome<a href="#calibre_link-31">.7  </a>This  is  why serious students of politics today have to be serious students of constitutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it is one of the considerations that led us to look beyond constitutions to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ultimate metaconstitution as determined by the prevailing megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">factors of a given environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Technological change has already swept away some of the foundations for</p>
<p class="calibre1">con ning the vote to geographic constituencies. When modern representative</p>
<p class="calibre1">382</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-262"></a>systems  emerged  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  almost  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications were local. Most people lived and died within a few miles of</p>
<p class="calibre1">where they were born, and the whole of their commerce and communication</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  conducted  local y.  Today  there  is  instantaneous  communication</p>
<p class="calibre1">worldwide.  You  can  do  business  with  someone  ve  thousand  miles  away</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost as easily as with a neighbor. To an increasing extent, the economy is</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcending geographic limitations. Society is far more mobile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so is wealth in the Information Age. Unlike a steel mil , a computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">program cannot easily be held hostage to the local political process. A steel</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil  can scarcely be moved when legislators determine to tax it or regulate its</p>
<p class="calibre1">owners. A computer program can be transmitted by modem at the speed of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light anywhere in the world. The owner can pack his 486 laptop computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  y  away.  This,  too,  undermines  the  megapolitical  foundations  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">geographic constituencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A major di culty that al  representative democratic systems share in light</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  our  analysis  is  that  their  geographic  constituencies  are  bound  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">overrepresent the vested interests of industrial-era enterprises. The “losers” or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“left-behinds”  are  perfect  constituents,  geographical y  concentrated  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political y  needy.  The  history  of  industrial  democracy  con rms  this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winners”  from  new  industries  were  chronical y  underrepresented  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">legislative  deliberations  even  in  the  high  tide  of  the  Industrial  Age  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1930s<a href="#calibre_link-31">.8</a>  The  tendency  of  politicians  to  represent  the  existing,  established competitors,  not  the  new  enterprises  that  might  come  into  being  or  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential  customers  of  new  enterprises,  is  probably  an  inherent  feature  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">representative government. As Mancur Olson argued in  <i class="calibre4">The Rise and Decline</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">of  Nations, </i>  long-lived  industries  tend  to  develop  more  e ective</p>
<p class="calibre1">“distributional coalitions” to lobby and struggle over political booty. <a href="#calibre_link-31">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This problem is magni ed immeasurably when it comes to the economy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Information Age. The more creative participants in the new economy</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  geographical y  distributed.  Therefore,  they  are  unlikely  to  form  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">su cient  concentration  to  gain  the  attention  of  legislators,  the  way  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">salmon  shers  in  Scotland  or  wheat  farmers  in  Saskatchewan  do.  Indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many  of  the  dynamic  personalities  of  the  new  economy  are  unlikely  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens of even the most encompassing jurisdiction. Thus they wil  have little</p>
<p class="calibre1">“voice”  in  the  legislative  deliberations  of  representative  democracies.  As  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">383</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-263"></a>tel ing example, consider the disreputable e orts of American math Ph.D.s to</p>

<p class="calibre1">xenophobic representations to Congress to block employers from hiring on</p>

<p class="calibre1">Few have begun to think in a concerted way about the consequences of</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological  change  in  undermining  industrialism  and  altering  income</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributions.  Obviously,  democracy  is  not  likely  to  be  much  more  than  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">recipe for legalized parasitism if incomes diverge as widely as they may in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">transition from agrarian society to urban industrialism. But the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age  may  require  new  mechanisms  of  representation  to  avoid  chronic</p>
<p class="calibre1">dysfunction and even Soviet-style col apse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You  can  expect  to  see  crises  of  misgovernment  in  many  countries  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  promises  are  de ated  and  governments  run  out  of  credit  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutional support. Ultimately, new institutional forms wil  have to emerge</p>
<p class="calibre1">that are capable of preserving freedom in the new technological conditions, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-311"></a>Al  this points to the end of mass democracy as we have known it in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century.  The  question  is,  What  wil   take  its  place?  If  the  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">alternative to mass democracy were dictatorship in which the individual has</p>
<p class="calibre1">no say in his destiny, then one might be tempted to join the neo-Luddites’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“revolt against the future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">New Institutions</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Happily, however, dictatorship is not the sole alternative to mass democracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information technology facilitates choice. Instead of col ective choice within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  constrained  setting  of  “mass  production,  mass  consumption,  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">education,  mass  media,  mass  entertainment,  and  al   the  rest,”  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  wil   facilitate  genuine,  consumer  choice  of  customized</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereignty  services.  This  wil   be  possible  because  operating  at  a  mass  scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   no  longer  be  imperative.  We  believe  that  the  technology  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age  wil   give  rise  to  new  forms  of  governance&mdash;just  as  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agricultural Revolution and, later, the industrial era brought forth their own</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctive forms of social organization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  might  such  new  institutions  be?  To  understand,  forget  anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">you  read  in  misnamed  “political  science”  texts.  The  new  institutions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governance  for  the  Information  Age  wil   trespass  the  boundaries  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">conventional thinking. The progress toward such institutions of the new age</p>
<p class="calibre1">has already begun. They are little-recognized improvisations for restructuring</p>
<p class="calibre1">underutilized  assets,  the  bene ts  of  sovereignty.  The  world’s  nation-states, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously  looking  over  their  shoulders  at  secession  movements  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful forces of devolution, have clubbed together to form the strongest</p>
<p class="calibre1">border- xing cartel that they can possibly enforce. While the number of new</p>
<p class="calibre1">states in the world has increased in the 1990s, this happened mainly in two</p>
<p class="calibre1">clusters,  thanks  to  the  col apse  of  multiethnic  Communist  dictatorships  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  former  Soviet  Union  and  Yugoslavia.  It  is  notable  that  other  leading</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states, including the United States, maneuvered to preserve the Soviet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union for as long as possible. And few governments welcomed the breakup</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  Yugoslavia.  The  independence  of  the  former  Yugoslav  republics  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized  only  after  secessionists  had  wrested  control  that  they  could</p>
<p class="calibre1">enforce through their own military e orts. The leading powers were content</p>
<p class="calibre1">385</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-317"></a>to  see  unarmed  or  poorly  armed  separatists  slaughtered  by  their  Serb</p>
<p class="calibre1">tormentors.  Even  faraway  China,  a  powerful  nation-state  with  no  direct</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest in preserving the rump of Yugoslavia, vigorously opposed e orts to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve  self-determination  for  oppressed  ethnic  Albanians  in  Kosovo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironical y,  this  border- xing  fetish  is  more  likely  to  dictate  the  path  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution  to  fragmented  sovereignty  than  to  actual y  forestal   devolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  erce  resistance  of  vulnerable  nation-states  across  the  globe  to  overt</p>
<p class="calibre1">secession and political disaggregation makes recognized sovereignty a valuable</p>
<p class="calibre1">form of transcendental capital that can be voluntarily fragmented and sublet</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the states possessing it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An example of how sovereignty can be voluntarily fragmented to create</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential y  private,  tax-free  jurisdiction  is  the  Agulhas  Bay  Concession  Free</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zone,  comprising  fty  square  kilometers  of  the  island  of  Principe  o   the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coast of West Africa. Although the territory remains within the borders of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, the administration of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the zone is privatized. Governance there is determined according to contract</p>
<p class="calibre1">administered by WADCO, the West African Development Corporation Ltd., </p>
<p class="calibre1">a private company chartered in South Africa. The language of record in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone  is  not  the  o cial  Tomean  tongue,  Portuguese,  but  English.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency of record is not the Tomean local Monopoly money, the dobra, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the globe’s money, the U.S. dol ar. Security is provided not by police forces of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Democratic  Republic  of  São  Tomé  and  Principe,  but  by  private  police</p>
<p class="calibre1">employed  by  WADCO.  São  Tomean  commercial  law  is  inapplicable  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercial  dealings  within  the  zone,  and  São  Tomean  courts  have  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction. Al  disputes must be settled by transnational arbitration, under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Paris ICC rules. With a few tightly regulated and trivial exceptions, São</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tomean  taxes  do  not  apply  within  the  zone,  nor  do  o cial  monopolies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telecommunications, for example, are automatical y deregulated within the</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone.  Subject  to  the  payment  of  rent  and  adherence  to  other  terms  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">concession,  WADCO  is  entitled  to  automatical y  and  repetitively  renew  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">lease on private, fragmented sovereignty for terms of  fty years, from the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">renewal date, 2047. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What-WADCO has achieved in São Tomé and Principe can and wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">matched by others in many di erent jurisdictions. One of the true pioneers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty- rst-century development, Joaquin Aguirre has created a similar zone</p>
<p class="calibre1">386</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-425"></a>of  private  sovereignty  in  the  Central  Aguirre  Portuaria,  in  eastern  Bolivia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aguirre, a multimil ionaire, novelist, and inventor, a cofounder of the United</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nations, and a former Senator of the Bolivian Republic, is a pioneer many</p>
<p class="calibre1">times  over.  Half  a  century  after  he  helped  to  found  the  United  Nations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aguirre is now a prototype for the Sovereign Individual of the twenty- rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">century. His Zona Franca, which is free of most Bolivian taxes, duties, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">regulatory  impositions,  points  the  way  toward  the  new  form  of  privatized</p>
<p class="calibre1">city-state which wil  increasingly be achieved by successful individuals in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age.  It  also  demonstrates  conclusively  that  the  lives  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">masses,  so  often  eulogized  by  the  apologists  of  big  government,  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramatical y improved by the economic development catalyzed by free trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">zones such as that launched by Señor Aguirre. As time passes, the number of</p>
<p class="calibre1">de  facto  city  states  in  the  world  wil   multiply  signi cantly.  Indeed,  if  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve su cient  nancial independence as an individual, you wil  be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve ultimate independence, like Joaquin Aguirre. In the event that no one</p>
<p class="calibre1">else’s  piece  of  fragmented,  commercialized  sovereignty  o ers  you  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable home base, you can launch your own proprietary ministate, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent as any dukedom of the Middle Ages. Instead of playing tug-of-</p>
<p class="calibre1">war  with  demagogues  and  political  hacks  to  keep  your  assets  from  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrested  away  and  divided  among  the  many  clamoring  hands  of  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy,  you  wil   be  able  to  establish  your  own  private  realm  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dramatic phase change from mass democracy to the ultimate form of</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-government,  individual  sovereignty,  need  not  involve  a  radical  shift  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">public  opinion,  nor  a  miraculous  vote,  by  disenchanted  electors  opting  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrap  mass  democracy.  Such  a  revolution  can  begin,  indeed,  already  has</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun,  invisibly,  with  the  leasing  of  sovereign  territory  for  use  as  tax-free</p>
<p class="calibre1">zones,  “Zona  Francas,”  and  free  ports.  In  due  course,  sovereignty  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragment repeatedly until it is so completely  ssured that dividing it further</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not yield a value su cient to o set the transaction costs of devolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given Moore’s Law and Gilder’s Corol ary, that bandwidth triples each year, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there is no basis at present to foresee any early end to the devolutionary trend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To the contrary, we anticipate that the apparently solid power of nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently  devoted  to  mass  democracy  wil   splinter  in  tens  of  thousands  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">387</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-264"></a>fragments  into  a  system  more  reminiscent  of  the  medieval  period  than  the modern industrial age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  due  course,  even  nation-states  that  retain  rump  institutions  of  mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy wil  experience a signi cant shift in policies to accommodate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new  metaconstitutional  realities.  As  Wil iam  Keech,  a  faithful  advocate  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy, argues in  <i class="calibre4">Economic Politics: The Costs of Democracy:</i> “People learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">to want what they see they can get, but they can also change their minds if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  see  that  they  do  not  like  what  they  wanted  and  what  they  got.” <a href="#calibre_link-31">12  </a>In other words, the fact that mass democracy with conventional institutions of</p>
<p class="calibre1">representative  government  is  hailed  everywhere  as  the  twentieth  century</p>
<p class="calibre1">draws  to  an  end  could  be  a  “sel   signal.”  It  by  no  means  assures  that  such</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision rules wil  stand the test of time, even in their own terms. Remember, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when you look outside politics, there is scarcely any evidence of executives, </p>
<p class="calibre1">administrators,  coaches,  or  other  professional  leaders  being  selected</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratical y.  To  the  contrary,  the  most  successful  leaders  are  routinely</p>
<p class="calibre1">hired  by  proprietors  through  selection  processes  in  which  those  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest interests at stake have an unequal and disproportionately greater say</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  determining  the  outcome.  If  democratic  selection  were  truly  a  superior</p>
<p class="calibre1">method  to  identify  competent  leaders,  you  would  expect  to  see  it  as  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">universal  decision  rule.  Instead,  it  is  con ned  almost  solely  to  the  political</p>
<p class="calibre1">realm. In short, it is more reasonable on current evidence to assume that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">provision of sovereignty services is hobbled by the dominance of democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision-making than it is to assume the opposite, namely, that corporate and</p>
<p class="calibre1">business organizations su er, because they are run by executives instal ed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprietors rather than according to a show of hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the middle of the twenty- rst century it is likely that the proliferation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of proprietary jurisdictions of fragmented sovereignty wil  have conclusively</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrated  the  advantages  of  proprietary  administration.  Voters  wil   see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  they  su er  for  being  saddled  with  mass  democracy.  Therefore,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Keech suggests, they wil  come to see that the bene ts derived from</p>
<p class="calibre1">employee  control  of  government  are  outweighed  by  its  costs.  They  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">migrate toward reform. Even electorates in Europe and North America that</p>
<p class="calibre1">now  seem  so  strongly  committed  against  reform  could  eventual y  vote  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make  their  regions  more  accommodating  to  proprietary  governance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Majorities may wil ingly, even gladly abandon the farce of politics in favor of</p>
<p class="calibre1">388</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-265"></a>proprietary  management  of  government  which  actual y  aims  toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving the optimum setting for concluding and enforcing contracts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To the extent that government with its familiar accoutrements survives at</p>
<p class="calibre1">al ,  it  may  be  informed  in  entirely  new  ways.  Somewhere,  in  some</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction,  sometime  before  the  crack  of  doom,  someone  wil   realize  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential  that  computer  technology  o ers  to  make  possible  truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">representative  government.  The  supposed  problem  of  excessive  campaign</p>
<p class="calibre1">expenditures and the undoubted annoyance of chronic political campaigning</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  resolved  in  an  instant.  Rather  than  being  elected,  representatives</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  selected  by  sortition  entirely  at  random,  with  a  high  statistical</p>
<p class="calibre1">probability that their talents and views would match those of the population</p>
<p class="calibre1">at large. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This would be merely a modern version of the ancient Greek system of</p>
<p class="calibre1">selection by lot. As E. S. Staveley details in his authoritative history,  <i class="calibre4">Greek and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Roman  Voting  and  Elections, </i>  numerous  positions  in  Athens,  from  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magistrates  to  the  archons,  were  selected  by  sortition  as  a  substitute  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">elections. This was cleverly accomplished, in spite of mechanical limitations</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the randomization of chances, through use of an al otment machine, “or, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as it was cal ed by the Athenians, the  <i class="calibre4">cleroterion. <a href="#calibre_link-31">” </a></i><a href="#calibre_link-31"> 13</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">A  series  of  black  and  white  beans  were  used  as  random  counters  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">that fewer lawyers and egomaniacs engrossed the public’s business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Legislatures could be composed of true representatives. Since they would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not be brought together by the pursuit of power, and would have a negligible</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance of being selected again by sortition in any event, they would be free to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct  the  a airs  of  government  and  formulate  policy  on  the  basis  of  a</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-266"></a>Today,  politicians  bent  on  optimizing  votes  have  little  incentive  to  analyze problems  coherently.  It  is  hardly  surprising,  therefore,  that  their  records  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual y  solving  problems  are  so  pathetic  as  compared  to  entrepreneurs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">business executives, and coaches of sports teams, who are rewarded according</p>
<p class="calibre1">to performance. Performance-based compensation for legislators would not</p>
<p class="calibre1">make everyone chosen at random as e ective as Lee Kuan Yew. But paying</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaders on the basis of their performance is just a logical extension of Lee’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful  “Flexiwage”  program  in  Singapore,  which  pays  government</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees on the basis of the real growth of the Singapore economy. There is</p>
<p class="calibre1">every reason to believe that performance would be greatly enhanced if the pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  legislators  and  executives  were  keyed  to  some  objective  measure  of</p>

<p class="calibre1">To  start,  al   would  agree  to  pool  their  disposable  income  and  thereafter</p>

<p class="calibre1">spend  individual y  in  thousands  of  ways,  everyone  would  get  one  vote  or</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps a few votes depending upon the number of o ces to be  l ed. Rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  spending  money  directly  to  obtain  what  you  want  at  any  time  you</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished,  you  would  spend  your  vote  or  votes  on  the  handful  of  occasions</p>

<p class="calibre1">forward and give “voice” to your views. You could draw the group’s attention</p>

<p class="calibre1">succinctly put it, “[I]t is computerized information, not manpower or mass</p>
<p class="calibre1">production that increasingly drives the U.S. economy and that wil  win wars</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a world wired for 500 TV channels. The computerized information exists</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  cyberspace&mdash;the  new  dimension  created  by  endless  reproduction  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer networks, satel ites, modems, databases and the public Internet. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”20</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Massed armies wil  mean little in such a world. E ciency wil  mean more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  ever  before.  Because  microtechnology  creates  a  new  dimension  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection,  as  we  explored  in  Chapter  6  and  elsewhere,  individuals  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rst time in human existence wil  be able to create and protect assets that lie</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely  outside  the  realm  of  any  individual  government’s  territorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">monopoly on violence. These assets, therefore, wil  be highly susceptible to</p>
<p class="calibre1">399</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-424"></a>individual  control.  It  wil   be  perfectly  reasonable  for  you  and  signi cant numbers  of  other  future  Sovereign  Individuals  to  “vote  with  your  feet”  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">opting out of leading nation-states to contract for protection of your assets</p>
<p class="calibre1">and your person with an outlying nation-state or a new minisovereignty that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  only charge a commercial y tolerable amount, rather than the greater part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of your net worth. In short, you would probably accept $50 mil ion to move</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Bermuda. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Exit First, Contract Later</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  early  stimulus  to  commercialization  of  sovereignty  wil   have  to  come</p>
<p class="calibre1">from persons expressing themselves economical y by exit. This option wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">most di cult in the United States, where it wil  also be most valuable. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Berlin  Wal ”  for  capitalists  imposed  by  President  Bil   Clinton  and  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Republican  Congress  contradicts  the  Declaration  of  Independence,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">proclaims  the  right  of  individuals  to  renounce  the  dominion  of  predatory</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments. It also undoes the slogan so con dently expressed by American</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalists  in  the  1960s,  “Love  it  or  leave  it.”  By  imposing  penal  taxes  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">those who leave, the exit tax is meant to compel loyalty. Yet this vindictive</p>
<p class="calibre1">legislation, reminiscent of the penalties imposed on  eeing property owners</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the last days of the Roman Empire, may inadvertently set the framework</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a more rational policy later in the Information Age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  some  point,  when  enough  able  persons  have  left  and  compounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">su ciently  large  fortunes  o shore,  it  wil   become  appealing  to  U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities, and those of other high-tax countries to al ow citizens or green</p>
<p class="calibre1">card holders to buy their way out of future tax liabilities by paying an exit tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">but not requiring that they actual y exit. After al , it is economical y in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest  of  any  sovereignty  that  economical y  productive  persons  remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">within  its  territory  and  create  value  rather  than  departing  to  a  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcoming jurisdiction. In other words, the exit tax could become the model</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a lump-sum buyout. The government imposing an exit tax would realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">far higher bene ts by al owing those exiting to resume residence under terms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a private treaty like those currently available in Switzerland and elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such moves on the part of the United States or other governments would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  rational  income-optimizing  gestures.  Eventual y,  competition  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">400</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-271"></a>protection services wil  force down tax rates and adjust the terms of taxation</p>
<p class="calibre1">to more civilized standards. Rather than depending upon legislatures to enact</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceptable  tax  regimes,  Sovereign  Individuals  in  the  future  wil   be  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiate acceptable, customized policy packages by private treaty. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of  course,  we  do  not  contend  for  a  moment  that  much  of  this  wil   be</p>

<p class="calibre1">with  its  commitment  to  redistribute,  income,  could  be  a  solution  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distresses  so  many  feel  with  the  competitive  pressures  brought  to  bear  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">information technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">E.  J.  Dionne,  Jr.,  is  a  political  reporter  for  the   <i class="calibre4">Washington  Post. </i>  Like</p>

<p class="calibre1">to  come  as  the  new  megapolitical  realities  of  the  Information  Age  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">decisively undermine institutions left over from the modern world. Dionne</p>
<p class="calibre1">sees the material improvements in living standards that were widely shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">within  rich  jurisdictions  in  the  twentieth  century  as  owing  mainly  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">democratic  politics  rather  than  to  technological  or  economic  development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His message is that hope for the future requires extending the dominion of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics over the technologies of the Information Age:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  overriding  need  in  the  United  States  and  throughout  the  democratic</p>
<p class="calibre1">world  is  for  a  new  engagement  with  democratic  reform,  the  political  engine</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  made  the  industrial  era  as  successful  as  it  was.  The  technologies  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information age wil  not on their own construct a successful society, any more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than industrialism left to itself would have made the world better.… Even the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  extraordinary  breakthroughs  in  technology  and  the  most  ingenious</p>
<p class="calibre1">applications of the Internet wil  not save us from social breakdown, crime or</p>
<p class="calibre1">injustice. Only politics, which is the art of how we organize ourselves, can even</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin to take on such tasks. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”21</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">401</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-272"></a>Dionne  and  others  like  him  fail  to  understand  that  the  conditions  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">made twentieth-century life particularly conducive to systematic compulsion</p>
<p class="calibre1">were  not  chosen  by  any  human  agency.  The  “art  of  how  we  organize</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves”  is  a  statement  that  would  not  have  been  intel igible  prior  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern period. Societies are too complex to be rightly considered the fruit of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any  wil ful  e ort  of  conscious  self-organization.  The  nation-states  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern  period  emerged  spontaneously  as  a  coincidental  by-product  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial  technology  that  raised  returns  to  violence.  Now  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  is  reducing  the  returns  to  violence.  This  makes  politics</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">“THEY DON’T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fervent  desire  to  “make  laws,”  which  seems  so  much  a  part  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“common sense” of twentieth-century politics, is by no means universal to al</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultures. Its disappearance in the future could be seen as part of a cycle that</p>
<p class="calibre1">has waxed and waned with the centuries. For example, early Greeks, among</p>
<p class="calibre1">others,  believed  that  laws  could  not  be  made.  In  the  words  of  philosopher</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernst Cassirer, the Greeks believed “the ‘unwritten laws,’ the laws of justice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">have no beginning in time. <a href="#calibre_link-31">”22</a> Like other prepolitical peoples, they felt that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no  one  could  improve  upon  the  natural,  “geometrical”  laws  of  justice  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had not been created by any human power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They did not believe in a “lawgiver.” As Cassirer put it, “It is by rational</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought that we are to  nd the standards of moral conduct, and it is reason, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  reason  alone,  that  can  give  them  their  authority.”  In  this  sense,  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt to impose laws upon society through legislation would be like trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to alter geometry by legislation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Legislation as Sacrilege</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">402</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-273"></a>For  very  di erent  reasons,  a  similar  resistance  to  “lawmaking”  prevailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through much of the medieval period. As John B. Morral  writes, “[F]or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Germans, law was something which had existed from time immemorial.” It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was “a guarantee of the rights” of individual members of the tribe<a href="#calibre_link-31">.23 </a>Kings</p>
<p class="calibre1">and councils</p>
<p class="calibre1">had  as  yet  no  intention  of  creating  new  law.  Such  an  intention  would  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been,  from  the  point  of  view  of  these  early  medieval  times,  not  only</p>
<p class="calibre1">super uous… but even semi-blasphemous, for law, like kingship, possessed its</p>
<p class="calibre1">own  sacrosanct  aura.  Instead,  king  and  council ors  thought  of  themselves  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely  explaining  or  clarifying  the  true  meaning  of  the  already  existing  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete body of law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germanic  custom  handed  on  to  the  medieval  mind  an  idea  which  it  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">never able to forget, even when in practice it behaved otherwise. This idea was</p>
<p class="calibre1">that good laws were rediscovered or restated but never remade<a href="#calibre_link-31">.24</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">After the excesses of twentieth-century legislation, there is something quaint</p>
<p class="calibre1">about that ancient attitude. The desire to put the coercive power of the state</p>
<p class="calibre1">to work for private ends, particularly the redistribution of income, became</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost second nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Regrets</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Little wonder, then, that there are sad songs for politics in its last days. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">are entirely predictable. And not only because they re ect the blindness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">most thinkers to the imperatives of megapolitics. Few political reporters, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dionne, are prepared to accept the apparent atrophy and demise of politics, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when doing so might put them back on the crime beat. At the end of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Middle Ages, voices were raised in support of reviving chivalry. Consider  <i class="calibre4">II</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Libro del Cortegiano, </i> or  <i class="calibre4">The Book of the Courtier, </i> written by Count Baldassare</p>
<p class="calibre1">Castiglione in 1514, and published at Venice in 1528 by Aldus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Castiglione’s longing for a return to virtues of chivalry was deeply felt, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">longing  for  a  defunct  way  of  life  could  not  bring  it  back  in  the  sixteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century. Nor wil  it in the twenty- rst century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we have attempted to convey in explaining our theory of megapolitics, </p>
<p class="calibre1">technological  imperatives,  not  popular  opinion,  are  the  most  important</p>
<p class="calibre1">sources of change in today’s world. If our theory of megapolitics is valid, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">403</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-274"></a>reason the modem age, with its concept of citizenship and politics organized</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the state, supplanted the feudal system and chivalry organized around</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal oaths and relationships was not a matter of ideas, but shifts in costs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  bene ts  arising  from  new  technology.  Chivalry  did  not  the  because</p>
<p class="calibre1">Castiglione or others failed to convince a disinterested populace who had any</p>
<p class="calibre1">control over the matter that there was no need for honor or morality in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">a airs of state. To the contrary, Castiglione’s  <i class="calibre4">Courtier</i> is critical of princes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the kind of behavior his contemporary, Niccolo Machiavel i, commended in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his  <i class="calibre4">II Principe, </i> or  <i class="calibre4">The Prince. </i> But so what? Machiavel i ultimately reached a</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger audience with his book, not because his argument in  <i class="calibre4">The Prince</i> was</p>
<p class="calibre1">more  eloquent  but  because  his  advice  better  suited  the  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions of the modern age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the distinguished twentieth-century philosopher Ernst Cassirer said in</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussing “The Moral Problem in Machiavel i,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The book describes, with complete indi erence, the ways and means by which</p>
<p class="calibre1">political power is to be acquired and maintained. About the right use of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">power it does not say a word.… No one had ever doubted that political  <i class="calibre4">life, </i> as</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters stand, is ful  of crimes, treacheries and felonies. But no thinker before</p>
<p class="calibre1">Machiavel i had undertaken to teach the  <i class="calibre4">art</i> of these crimes. These things were</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,  but  they  were  not  taught.  That  Machiavel i  promised  to  become  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacher in the art of craft, per dy, and cruelty was a thing unheard of<a href="#calibre_link-32">.25</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  short,  <i class="calibre4">The  Prince</i>  was  a  radical  work  that  spel ed  out  a  modern  recipe</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereby an aspiring ruler could succeed in advancing his career at any cost to</p>
<p class="calibre1">others. Machiavel i endorsed conduct that proved wel  suited to the nature of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politics  in  an  age  of  power.  But  the  art  of  the  double-cross,  which  was  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrewd  policy  for  politicians  in  the  modern  era,  was  outrageous  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">subversive in terms of the culture of chivalry that had grown up in previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  we  explored  earlier,  the  virtues  of  chivalry  included  an  emphasis  on</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme  delity to oaths. This was a necessity in a society where protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">was  organized  in  exchange  for  personal  services.  The  bargains  upon  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">feudal  society  rested  were  not  such  that  they  would  have  reemerged</p>
<p class="calibre1">spontaneously among people free to determine where their best interests lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">under  conditions  of  duress.  Therefore,  feudal  commitments  that  were  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">404</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-398"></a>basis of chivalry  had  to  be  shorn  up  with  a  strong  sense  of  honor.  In  that context, little could have been more subversive than Machiavel i’s suggestion</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  Prince  should  not  hesitate  to  lie,  cheat,  and  steal  when  so  doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">served his interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  twentieth  century  drew  to  a  close,  Machiavel i’s  arguments  were</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil  being examined for their importance in understanding modern politics</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  various  twentieth-century  crimes  and  tyrannies.  Castiglione’s  work,  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrast, is al  but forgotten. In a year’s time,  <i class="calibre4">II Libro del Cortegiano</i> may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">read from cover to cover by a handful of literature students at the graduate</p>
<p class="calibre1">level and a few connoisseurs of the history of manners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometime  within  the  next  few  decades,  the  new  megapolitics  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Age  wil   antiquate   <i class="calibre4">The  Prince. </i>  The  Sovereign  Individual  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">require a new recipe for success, one which wil  highly emphasize honor and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rectitude in deploying resources outside the grip of the state. We can predict</p>
<p class="calibre1">that such advice wil  not be read with pleasure by E. J. Dionne, Jr., and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other living social democrats. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Policy Set by Customers</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  wil   be  especial y  true  early  in  the  transition,  when  most  jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   stil   be  lumbered  with  the  necessity  of  formulating  policies  whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">advocates can attract popular assent from a majority of the population. Later, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as democracy fades away and the market for sovereignty services deepens, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  conditions  that  constrain  “policy”  wil   become  more  broadly</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What we now think of as “political” leadership, which is always conceived</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  terms  of  a  nation-state,  wil   become  increasingly  entrepreneurial  rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  political  in  nature.  In  these  conditions,  the  viable  range  of  choice  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">putting  together  a  “policy”  regime  for  a  jurisdiction  wil   be  e ectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrowed in the same way that the range of options open to entrepreneurs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">designing a  rst-class resort hotel or any similar product or service is de ned</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  what  people  wil   pay  for.  A  resort  hotel,  for  example,  would  seldom</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt to operate on terms that required guests to perform hard labor to</p>
<p class="calibre1">repair and extend its facilities. Even a resort hotel owned or control ed by its</p>
<p class="calibre1">employees,  like  the  typical  modern  democracy,  would  try  in  vain  to  force</p>
<p class="calibre1">405</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-375"></a>customers  to  comply  with  such  demands,  especial y  after  better</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodations  became  available.  If  the  customers  would  rather  play  golf</p>
<p class="calibre1">than do heavy labor in the hot sun, then on that question, at least, the market</p>
<p class="calibre1">o ers  little  scope  for  imposing  arbitrary  alternatives.  In  such  conditions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">presently  “political”  issues  wil   recede  into  entrepreneurial  judgments,  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragmented jurisdictions seek to discover which policy bundles wil  attract a</p>
<p class="calibre1">viable cross-section of customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Atrophy of Politics</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  this  becomes  understood,  there  wil   be  a  sea  change  in  attitudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Populations in devolving jurisdictions wil  no longer expect to select from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same range of wish-ful l ing policy options that engrossed political debate in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  twentieth  century.  With  income-earning  capacity  more  highly  skewed</p>
<p class="calibre1">than in the industrial era, jurisdictions wil  tend to cater to the needs of those</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers whose business is most valuable and who have the greatest choice</p>
<p class="calibre1">of where to bestow it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under such conditions, it may matter much less than we are accustomed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  assume  whether  or  not  policies  that  are  commercial y  optimal  for  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction would appeal to the “median, voter” in a focus group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, the commercialization of sovereignty wil  facilitate the control of</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments  by  their  customers.  This  wil   tend  to  make  the  opinions  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">noncustomers  irrelevant,  or  less  relevant,  just  as  the  opinions  of  Big  Mac</p>
<p class="calibre1">eaters  about  foie  gras  are  irrelevant  to  the  success  of  three-star  French</p>
<p class="calibre1">restaurants, like L’Arpège in Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">“THE BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  late  Christopher  Lasch,  objectors  wil   not  only  complain  that</p>

<p class="calibre1">democracy because it al ows individuals to place their resources outside the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach of political compulsion. For this reason, the reactionaries of the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ennium  wil   nd  the  nancial  privacy  facilitated  by  information</p>

<p class="calibre1">We have already discussed arguments advanced by Lasch in  <i class="calibre4">Revolt of the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Elites  and  the  Betrayal  of  Democracy. </i>  But  his  is  not  the  only  diatribe  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">support  of  the  nation-state.  Harvard  University  political  theorist  Michael</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sandel  argues  in   <i class="calibre4">Democracy’s  Discontent</i>  that  “Democracy  today  is  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible without a politics that can control global economic forces, because</p>
<p class="calibre1">without such control it won’t matter who people vote for, the corporations</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   rule.” <a href="#calibre_link-32">27</a>  In  other  words,  the  state  must  retain  its  parasitic  power  over individuals,  in  order  to  assure  that  political  outcomes  can  diverge  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">market  outcomes.  Otherwise  col ective  decisions  to  compel  diseconomic</p>
<p class="calibre1">outcomes would be meaningless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In our view, Sandel’s lament, like that of Lasch, is no more than half right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We concede that democracy wil  lose much of its importance if governments</p>
<p class="calibre1">lack the power to compel individuals to behave as politicians insist. This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious.  Indeed,  democracy  as  it  has  been  known  in  the  nineteenth  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  centuries  is  destined  to  disappear.  But  Sandel  misses  the  real</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance of the triumph of markets over compulsion. His invocation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“corporate rule” as a danger attendant upon the col apse of the nation-state is</p>
<p class="calibre1">strikingly anachronistic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporations wil  hardly be in a position to rule the markets of the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">global  economy.  Indeed,  as  we  have  suggested,  it  is  far  from  obvious  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations wil  even continue to exist in their familiar modern form. Far</p>
<p class="calibre1">from  it.  Firms  are  almost  bound  to  be  transformed  in  the  megapolitical</p>
<p class="calibre1">407</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-276"></a>revolution that comes with the introduction of the Information Age. As we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have previously discussed, microprocessing wil  alter the “information costs” </p>
<p class="calibre1">that help determine the “nexus of contracts” that de ne  rms. As economists</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michael C. Jensen and Wil iam H. Meckling suggest, corporations are merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">one legal form that provides “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships</p>
<p class="calibre1">among individuals. <a href="#calibre_link-32">”28</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether the corporation can even survive, much less “rule” as “a domain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces,” is itself likely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be determined, in the words of economists Louis Putterman and Randal  S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kroszner,  by  “the  completeness  of  market  forces  and  the  ability  of  market</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces to penetrate intra rm relationships. <a href="#calibre_link-32">”29</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">As we argued earlier, it is doubtful that  rms wil  be able to survive the</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing  penetration  of  market  forces  into  what  have  heretofore  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">“intra rm  relationships.”  As  a  result,  rms  wil   tend  to  dissolve  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">information  technology  makes  it  more  rewarding  to  rely  upon  the  price</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism and the auction market to undertake tasks that need doing rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than having them internalized within a formal organization. As information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology increasingly automates the production process, it wil  take away</p>
<p class="calibre1">part  of  the   <i class="calibre4">raison  d’être</i>  of  the  rm,  the  need  to  employ  and  motivate</p>
<p class="calibre1">managers to monitor individual workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">“Why Are There Firms?” </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember,  the  question  “Why  are  there  rms?”  is  not  as  trivial  as  it  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem on casual observation. Microeconomics general y assumes that the price</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism  is  the  most  e ective  means  of  coordinating  resources  for  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">most valued uses. As Putterman and Kroszner observe, this tends to imply</p>
<p class="calibre1">that organizations like  rms have no inherent “economic  <i class="calibre4">raison d’être</i><a href="#calibre_link-32">”30 </a>In this  sense,  rms  are  mainly  artifacts  of  information  and  transaction  costs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which information technologies tend to reduce drastical y. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  Information  Age  wil   tend  to  be  the  age  of  independent</p>
<p class="calibre1">contractors  without  “jobs”  with  long-lasting  “ rms.”  Equal y,  when</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  success  depends  upon  talented  individuals,  they  may  receive</p>
<p class="calibre1">outsized  pay  and  extravagant  bonuses  to  provide  their  services,  much  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">professional athletes and movie stars command huge rewards for their talents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">408</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-399"></a>In any event, as technology lowers transaction costs, the very process that wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">enable individuals to escape from domination by politicians wil  also prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">“rule  by  corporations.”  Corporations  wil   compete  with  “virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations” from across the globe to a degree that wil  disturb and threaten</p>
<p class="calibre1">al   but  a  few.  Most  corporations  as  institutions  wil   be  lucky  to  survive</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensi ed competition as markets become more complete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  consequence  to  be  expected  is  not  that  individuals  wil   be  at  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mercy  of  corporations.  To  the  contrary.  Corporations,  per  se,  wil   have  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">more power to rig markets than politicians. It is rather that individuals wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">nal y be free to determine their own destinies in a truly free market, ruled</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither by big governments nor corporate hierarchies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  erosion  of  transaction  costs  wil   also  put  the  lie  to  recently</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashionable notions of “stakeholder capitalism.” Such notions, dear to Tony</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blair  of  Britain’s  Labour  Party  as  wel   as  some  within  Bil   Clinton’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">entourage,  are  predicated  upon  the  ability  of  the  state  to  manipulate  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporation.  Socialism  having  col apsed,  interventionists  now  dream  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieving  the  ends  of  socialism  through  more  market-e cient  means  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavily  regulating  the  rm.  This  new  redistributive  theory  holds  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">management,  shareholders,  employees,  and  “community”  are  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">“stakeholders”  of  rms.  The  argument  is  that  they  al   derive  bene ts  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-lasting  rms,  and  even  depend  upon  these  bene ts.  Therefore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">regulation  ought  to  protect  the  stakes  that  managers,  employees,  and  local</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxing authorities have in the continuation of their historic relations with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stakeholder  capitalism”  is  a  doctrine  that  ultimately  presupposes  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only  an  ability  of  the  state  to  manipulate  the  decision-making  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations,  but  even  more  basical y  presupposes  the  existence  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations  as  long-standing  organizations  capable  of  functioning</p>
<p class="calibre1">independently of price signals in the auction market. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  suspect  that  the  deepening  of  markets  wil   not  only  diminish  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxing capacity of the nation-state, it wil  also erode the capacity of politicians</p>
<p class="calibre1">to impose their wil  arbitrarily upon the owners of resources by regulation. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">a world where jurisdictional advantages wil  be subject to market tests, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">many local markets wil  be opened to competition from anywhere, it is hardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  expected  that  local  “communities”  wil   have  many  e ective  ways  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">409</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-277"></a>isolating favored  rms from global competitive pressures. Therefore, they wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">have few ways of assuring that corporations lumbered with higher costs (for</p>
<p class="calibre1">example,  to  retain  unnecessary  employees  and  management  personnel,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep unneeded facilities open to accommodate local political pressures) wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  able  to  o set  those  costs  and  stay  in  business.  In  the  Industrial  Age, </p>
<p class="calibre1">politicians  could  close  markets  and  restrict  entry  to  a  few  favored  rms  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet employment and other objectives. In the future, when information wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  freely  tradable  anywhere  on  the  globe,  the  power  of  governments  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">insulate local businesses from global competitive pressures wil  be minimal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither is it likely that cal s for a “new social contract” focused on a so-</p>

<p class="calibre1">Microtechnology itself wil  facilitate new means of  nancing and regulating</p>
<p class="calibre1">the provision of goods heretofore treated as public goods. In retrospect, some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of these goods wil  prove to have been private goods in disguise. Highways</p>
<p class="calibre1">represent a key example. So long as congestion was a minor problem, roads</p>
<p class="calibre1">and highways could be treated as if they were public goods, albeit subject to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  criticisms  leveled  by  Adam  Smith  that  they  disproportional y  bene t</p>
<p class="calibre1">those  living  nearby  at  the  expense  of  those  in  remote  regions  who  are</p>

<p class="calibre1">In the Information Age, it wil  be technological y feasible to impose tol s, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including congestion fees, that accurately price access to highways, runways, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and other infrastructure without interrupting tra c  ow. Thus the provision</p>
<p class="calibre1">transportation  infrastructure  could  be  discretely  privatized  and  nanced</p>

<p class="calibre1">liberated  from  the  bounds  of  reality  as  human  ingenuity  can  make  it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly,  this  wil   have  tremendous  implications  for  the  quality  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">character of the information you receive. In a world of arti cial reality and</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantaneous transmission of everything everywhere, integrity of judgment</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  ability  to  distinguish  the  true  from  the  false  wil   be  even  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  this  wil   be  less  of  a  change  from  our  current  circumstances  than</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  people  would  imagine.  The  distinctions  between  true  and  false  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly blurred for reasons that have been ampli ed by technology. We say</p>
<p class="calibre1">this  recognizing  that  many  of  the  consequences  of  the  Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolution have been liberating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Technology  has  already  begun  to  transcend  geographic  proximity  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political domination. Governments can erect barriers to hinder the trade in</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods,  but  they  can  do  much  less  to  halt  the  transmission  of  information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost every diner at any restaurant in Hong Kong is connected by cel ular</p>
<p class="calibre1">phone to the whole globe. The hard-line coup plotters in Moscow in August</p>
<p class="calibre1">1991 could not shut down Yeltsin’s communications because he had cel ular</p>
<p class="calibre1">phones. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">More Information, Less Understanding</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  barriers  to  transmission  of  information  have  fal en,  there  has  been</p>
<p class="calibre1">more of it, which is good. But there has also been more confusion about what</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  means.  The  modern  technology  that  helps  liberate  information  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">political controls and impediments of time and place also tends to raise the</p>
<p class="calibre1">value of old-fashioned judgment. The kind of insight that helps discern what</p>
<p class="calibre1">415</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-388"></a>is important and true from the mountain of facts and fantasies is growing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">value almost daily. This is true for at least three reasons:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brevity  leads  to  abbreviation.  Abbreviation  leaves  out  what  is  unfamiliar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  you  have  many  facts  to  digest  and  lots  of  phone  cal s  to  return,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural  desire  is  to  make  each  information-processing  event  as  concise  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible.  Unfortunately,  abbreviated  information  often  provides  a  poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely  the  parts  that  tend  to  be  edited  out  in  the  twenty- ve-second</p>
<p class="calibre1">soundbites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">paradigm of understanding. You can report a basebal  or a cricket score much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more easily than you can explain how basebal  or cricket is played and what it</p>
<p class="calibre1">means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Rapidly changing technology is undermining the megapolitical basis of</p>
<p class="calibre1">social  and  economic  organization.  As  a  consequence,  broad  paradigmatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding,  or  unspoken  theories  about  the  way  the  world  works,  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">being  antiquated  more  quickly  than  in  the  past.  This  increases  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance  of  the  broad  overview  and  diminishes  the  value  of  individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">“facts”  of  the  kind  that  are  readily  available  to  almost  anyone  with  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">information retrieval system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.  The  growing  tribalization  and  marginalization  of  life  have  had  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stunting  e ect  on  discourse,  and  even  on  thinking.  Many  people  have</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequently gotten into the habit of shying away from conclusions that are</p>
<p class="calibre1">obviously implied by the facts at their disposal. A recent psychological study</p>
<p class="calibre1">disguised  as  a  public  opinion  pol   showed  that  members  of  individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupational  groups  were  almost  uniformly  unwil ing  to  accept  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusion that implied a loss of income for them, no matter how airtight the</p>
<p class="calibre1">logic  supporting  it.  Given  increased  specialization,  most  of  the  interpretive</p>
<p class="calibre1">information about most specialized occupational groups is designed to cater</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  the  interests  of  the  groups  themselves.  They  have  little  interest  in  views</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  might  be  impolite,  unpro table,  or  political y  incorrect.  There  is  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">better  example  of  this  general  tendency  than  the  broad  drumbeat  of  views</p>
<p class="calibre1">implying  bright  prospects  for  investing  in  the  stock  market.  Most  of  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">information is generated by brokerage  rms, few of which wil  tel  you that</p>
<p class="calibre1">416</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-281"></a>stocks are overvalued. Their income is derived from transaction business that</p>
<p class="calibre1">depends  on  the  majority  of  customers  being  ready  to  buy.  Independent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary voices are seldom heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For these and other reasons, the Age of Information has not yet become</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Age of Understanding. To the contrary, there has been a sharp drop-o  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rigor of public discourse. The world now could know more than at any</p>
<p class="calibre1">time in the past. But there is almost no public voice left to assess the meaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">of events and say what is true. This is why we have been fascinated to see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tepid interest, particularly in the U.S. media, in reporting hints of sensational</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruption at high levels of the U.S. government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  central  theme  we  have  wrestled  with  in  this  book  is  how  changing</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  and  other  “megapolitical”  factors  alter  the  “natural  economy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The “natural economy” is the Darwinian “state of nature” where outcomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">are  determined,  sometimes  unfairly,  by  physical  force.  In  the  “natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy,”  an  important  strand  of  behavior  is  what  biologists  cal</p>
<p class="calibre1">“interference competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Interference Competition</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interference  competitors,”  as  Jack  Hirshleifer  put  it,  “gain  and  maintain</p>
<p class="calibre1">control over resources by directly  ghting o  or hampering their rivals.…” <a href="#calibre_link-32">2</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">However much we may wish that human behavior were always subject to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule  of  law  and  “other  social y  enforced  rules  of  the  game”  (“political</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy”), there is ample evidence that many people “play by the rules” only</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  it  suits  them.  Hirshleifer,  an  authority  on  con ict,  put  it  this  way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“[T]he persistence of crime, war and politics teaches us that actual human</p>
<p class="calibre1">a airs  stil   remain  largely  subject  to  the  underlying  pressures  of  natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy. <a href="#calibre_link-32">”3</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  economic  outcomes  are  determined  only  partly  by  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">peaceful  and  law-abiding  behavior  of  the   <i class="calibre4">Homo  economicus</i>  described  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">textbooks, who honor property rights “and wil  not simply take what does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not belong to them.” <a href="#calibre_link-32">4 </a>Actual outcomes are also shaped by con ict, including</p>
<p class="calibre1">overt  violence.  As  economist  Hirshleifer  points  out,  “Even  under  law  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">government,  the  rational,  self-interested  individual  wil   strike  a  balance</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  lawful  and  unlawful  means  of  acquiring  resources&mdash;between</p>
<p class="calibre1">417</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-282"></a>production and exchange on the one hand and theft, fraud and extortion on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other. <a href="#calibre_link-32">”5</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MUGGING IN THE INFORMATION AGE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Michel e R. Gar nkel and Stergios Skaperdas explore this in a useful book on</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence,  crime,  and  politics,  <i class="calibre4">The  Political  Economy  of  Conflict  and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Appropriation:</i>  “Individuals  and  groups  can  either  produce  and  thus  create</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth or seize the wealth created by others.” <a href="#calibre_link-32">6</a> They quote a tale of modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">interference competition original y reported by the  <i class="calibre4">Economist:</i> “An American</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman,  recently  arrived  in  Moscow  to  open  an  o ce,  was  met  at  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel by  ve men with gold watches, pistols and a print-out of his  rm’s net</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth. They demanded 7% of future earnings. He took the  rst  ight to New</p>
<p class="calibre1">York, where muggers are less sophisticated.” <a href="#calibre_link-32">7</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  tale  of  mugging  in  the  Information  Age  owes  more  to  new</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  than  the  simple  fact  that  thugs  in  Russia  now  have  access  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">nancial pro les and credit reports on their victims through the Internet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Falling Decisiveness of Military Power</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For  good  and  for  il ,  by  making  large-scale  military  power  less  decisive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">information technology has radical y reduced the capacity of the nation-state</p>
<p class="calibre1">to impose its authority in an unruly world. If once, as Voltaire said, God was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“on the side of bigger battalions,” there appears to be less divine support with</p>
<p class="calibre1">every day that passes for generating large returns to violence. Instead, we see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  opposite&mdash;more  evidence  of  diminishing  returns  to  violence&mdash;which</p>
<p class="calibre1">strongly  implies  that  large  conglomerations  like  the  nation-state  wil   no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer justify their huge overhead costs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  most  obvious  evidence  of  the  declining  decisiveness  of  centralized</p>
<p class="calibre1">power is the rise of terrorism. High-pro le bombings in the United States in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  mid-nineties  show  that  even  the  world’s  military  superpower  is  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">immune from attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  important  manifestation  of  fal ing  returns  to  violence  is  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worldwide  growth  of  gangsterism  and  organized  crime,  along  with  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">corol ary, political cronyism and corruption. They re ect a general y amoral</p>
<p class="calibre1">418</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-393"></a>atmosphere in which the state can coerce but not protect. As its monopoly of</p>
<p class="calibre1">violence frays, new competitors edge into the scene, like the bul y-boys who</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried  to  impose  their  own  private  taxes  on  the  American  businessman  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smal   groups,  tribes,  triads,  gangs,  gangsters,  ma as,  militias,  and  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">solitary  individuals  have  gained  increasing  military  e ectiveness.  They  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise far more real power in the “natural economy” of the next mil ennium</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  they  did  in  the  twentieth  century.  Weapons  that  employ  microchips</p>
<p class="calibre1">have tended to shift the balance of power toward the defense, making decisive</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggression less pro table and therefore less likely. Smart weapons, like Stinger</p>
<p class="calibre1">missiles, for example, e ectively neutralize much of the advantage that large, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthy  states  formerly  enjoyed  in  deploying  expensive  air  power  to  attack</p>
<p class="calibre1">poorer, smal er groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Information War Ahead</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Looming  ahead  is  the  widely  discussed  but  little-understood  possibility  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Information War.” It also points to diminishing returns to violence. “Logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">bombs”  could  disable  or  sabotage  air-tra c  control  systems,  rail-switching</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanisms, power generators and distribution networks, water and sewage</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems,  telephone  relays,  even  the  military’s  own  communications.  As</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies  become  more  dependent  upon  computerized  controls,  “logic</p>
<p class="calibre1">bombs” could do almost as much damage as physical explosions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike conventional bombs, “logic bombs” could be detonated remotely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not  just  by  hostile  governments  but  by  groups  of  free-lance  computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmers, and even talented individual hackers. Note that an Argentine</p>
<p class="calibre1">teenager  was  arrested  in  1996  for  repeatedly  hacking  into  Pentagon</p>
<p class="calibre1">computers. While to date hackers have not tended to tamper with computer-</p>
<p class="calibre1">control ed  systems  in  destructive  ways,  this  is  not  because  there  are  truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">e ective ways of stopping them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  age  of  Information  War  nal y  arrives,  it  is  unlikely  that  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">antagonists wil  only be governments. A company like Microsoft certainly has</p>
<p class="calibre1">a greater ability to conduct Information War than 90 percent of the world’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">419</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-283"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Age of the Sovereign Individual</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  part  of  the  reason  why  we  have  entitled  this  book   <i class="calibre4">The  Sovereign</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Individual</i>.  As  the  scale  of  warfare  fal s,  defense  and  protection  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">mounted at a smal er scale. Therefore, they wil  increasingly be private rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than public goods, provided on a for-pro t basis by private contractors. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is already evident in the privatization of policing in North America. One of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the more rapidly growing occupations in the United States is the “security</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard.” Projections indicate that the number of private security guards wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase 24 percent to 40 percent above 1990 levels by the year 2005. <a href="#calibre_link-32">8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The privatization of policing is already a wel -de ned trend. Yet as Anglo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irish  guru  Hamish  McRae  points  out,  this  is  hardly  the  result  of  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberate decision of government. He writes in  <i class="calibre4">The World in 2020:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">No  government  has  made  a  speci c  decision  to  move  out  of  some  policing</p>
<p class="calibre1">tasks, nor indeed, have any moved out; the private sector has moved in. Partly as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a result of the perceived failures of the police, partly as a result of other changes</p>
<p class="calibre1">in society, private security  rms have gradual y been taking over much of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">job of protecting ordinary civilians in their o ces or shopping centres. As the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gated  communities  of  Los  Angeles  show,  people  are  even  moving  some  way</p>
<p class="calibre1">back  towards  the  medieval  concept  of  a  city,  where  the  citizens  live  behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">town wal s patrol ed by guards, and where access is possible only at control ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">gates. <a href="#calibre_link-33">9</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  believe  that  this  is  only  a  foretaste  of  more  comprehensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">privatization  of  almost  every  function  undertaken  by  governments  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth  century.  Because  information  technology  has  undermined  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity  of  centralized  authority  to  project  power  and  provide  physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">security for systems that operate at a large scale, the optimal size of almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">every enterprise in the “natural economy” is fal ing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To respond to this technological change wil  entail a massive investment</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirement  (read  opportunity)  to  redesign  vulnerable  systems  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed  rather  than  concentrated  capabilities.  If  vulnerabilities  of  large</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale  are  not  removed,  the  systems  that  retain  them  wil   be  subject  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">catastrophic failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner or later, by default if not by design, services and products provided</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  large  bureaucratic  agencies  and  corporations  wil   devolve  into  highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">420</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-284"></a>competitive  markets,  managed  not  from  a  “headquarters”  but  through  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed, decentralized network. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corporation with a headquarters that can be surrounded by pickets or</p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotaged  by  terrorists  wil   be  vulnerable  until  it  ultimately  becomes  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“virtual  corporation”  without  a  location,  “dwel ing  in  many  places</p>
<p class="calibre1">concurrently,” as Kevin Kel y, executive editor of  <i class="calibre4">Wired</i> magazine writes in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Out  Of  Control</i>. <a href="#calibre_link-33">10</a>  Kel y  understands  that  technology  has  changed  the imperative  to  bring  production  processes  under  centralized  control.  “For</p>
<p class="calibre1">most  of  the  industrial  revolution,  serious  wealth  was  made  by  bringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes under one roof. Bigger was more e cient.” Now it isn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kel y foresees the possibility that an automobile of the future, the Upstart</p>
<p class="calibre1">Car,  could  be  designed  and  brought  to  production  by  as  few  as  a  dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">people col aborating in a virtual corporation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  future,  excessive  scale  could  be  not  only  counterproductive  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous. Larger enterprises make more tempting targets. As practitioners</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  underground  economy  demonstrate,  one  of  the  secrets  of  avoiding</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxation is to avoid detection. This wil  be much easier for smal -scale, “virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations”  than  old-line  corporations  operating  out  of  a  skyscraper</p>
<p class="calibre1">headquarters  with  their  names  in  lights.  They  are  bound  to  be  more</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerable  to  the  attentions  of  “men  with  gold  watches,  pistols  and  a</p>

<p class="calibre1">426</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-289"></a>Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown. According to Morris, Lasater “was never</p>

<p class="calibre1">Speci cal y,  Brown  testi es  that  he  was  personal y  dispatched  to  Puerto</p>

<p class="calibre1">More speci cal y, Reed and his coauthor claim that both Clinton and Bush</p>

<p class="calibre1">to tel  at least part of their tales, which makes them luckier than others who</p>

<p class="calibre1">427</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-290"></a>provided security for the Clinton-Gore headquarters in 1992 and was shot</p>

<p class="calibre1">twist to a twisted tale, London’s  <i class="calibre4">Sunday Telegraph</i> has revealed, on the basis</p>
<p class="calibre1">of exclusive information provided by Parks’s widow, that Parks was hired to</p>
<p class="calibre1">spy on Bil  Clinton by the late Vincent Foster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why Foster wanted to compile a dossier of compromising information on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton is anyone’s guess. (He said he was doing it for Hil ary.) But in any</p>
<p class="calibre1">event  it  belies  the  o cial  depiction  of  Foster  as  a  naïve  country  boy,  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">shocked by the ruthless ways of Washington that he kil ed himself in despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That never-plausible story becomes less plausible with each new revelation. <a href="#calibre_link-33">27</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">The Mob’s President</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">While the world as a whole draws back from the disturbing conclusion that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  President  of  the  United  States  is  tainted  by  close  association  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized  crime  and  criminals,  that  is  what  the  evidence  suggests.  Morris</p>
<p class="calibre1">quotes a former U.S. Attorney who tracked organized crime  gures and their</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests.  He  claims  that  Clinton’s  election  as  governor  in  1984  “was  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">election when the mob real y came into Arkansas politics, the dog-track and</p>
<p class="calibre1">racetrack boys, the payo  people who saw a good thing… it went beyond our</p>

<p class="calibre1">Apparently, others of like mind have continued to notice the possibilities</p>

<p class="calibre1">most  mobbed-up  unions  in  America.” <a href="#calibre_link-33">29</a>  Of  particular  interest  is  Clinton’s close relationship with Arthur Coia. Coia, who is one of Clinton’s “prime</p>
<p class="calibre1">fund  raisers,”  is  president  of  the  Laborers  International  Union  of  North</p>
<p class="calibre1">America, “one of the most  amboyantly corrupt unions in labor history. <a href="#calibre_link-33">”30</a></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">York</i> describes as a “weirdly generous deal” with Coia “to keep his job in the</p>

<p class="calibre1">a long-time associate of organized-crime  gures.” <a href="#calibre_link-33">31</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">428</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-291"></a>Whether or not Terry Reed’s thesis is correct that “the CIA has co-opted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the presidency,” there is obviously a strong temptation for individuals within</p>
<p class="calibre1">a covert organization authorized to undertake “black operations” to indulge</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  Professor  Hirshleifer’s  rational  choice  of  employing  “unlawful  means  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquiring resources.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the technological change that is reducing the decisiveness of massed</p>
<p class="calibre1">military  power  in  the  world,  one  should  perhaps  expect  to  see  increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruption,  if  not  outright  takeover  of  governments  by  organized  criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hirshleifer  argues,  and  we  agree,  that  “the  institutions  of  political</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy  can  never  be  so  perfect  as  to  entirely  displace…  the  underlying</p>
<p class="calibre1">realities of natural economy. <a href="#calibre_link-33">”32 </a>Power is devolving in the “natural economy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This implies far-reaching shifts in the internal margins of power in society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Political  corruption,  as  Vito  Tanzi  shrewdly  notes,  “represents  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">privatization of the state in which its power is not shifted to the market, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">privatization  normal y  implies,  but  to  government  o cials  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucrats.” <a href="#calibre_link-33">33</a>  In  e ect,  this  has  happened  to  the  FBI  and  other  police agencies under Clinton. The “rule of law” is becoming whatever Clinton and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his cronies want it to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  of  now,  there  seems  little  evidence  that  details  of  these  corrupt</p>
<p class="calibre1">connections wil  carry any weight with voters, even if they were taken up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussed in the mass media. To the contrary. There seems to be little concern</p>
<p class="calibre1">about  hints  that  the  President  of  the  United  States  is  complicit  in  drug</p>
<p class="calibre1">running, money laundering, and worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This brings to mind the late Walter Lippmann’s fear that voters lacked the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perception to see through what he cal ed  ctitious personalities. He thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">that voters “are il -served by  attery and adulation. And they are betrayed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the servile hypocrisy which tel s them that what is true and what is false, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is right and what is wrong, can be determined by their votes. <a href="#calibre_link-33">”34</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lippmann perceived a “breakdown in the constitutional order” that could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be “the cause of the precipitate and catastrophic decline of Western society.…</p>
<p class="calibre1">We have fal en far in a short span of time.… What we have seen is not only</p>
<p class="calibre1">decay&mdash;though  much  of  the  old  structure  is  dissolving&mdash;but  something</p>

<p class="calibre1">429</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-292"></a>The problem is that political judgments seem less a response to the real</p>
<p class="calibre1">world than to a pseudoreality that the general public has constructed about</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena beyond their direct knowledge<a href="#calibre_link-33">.36</a> But it is a mistake for you to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">governed  by  the  limits  of  what  others  see.  Even  if  you  do  not  give  a  twig</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether Vincent Foster was murdered, and his murder covered up by the top</p>
<p class="calibre1">police  agencies  and  responsible  o cials  of  the  U.S.  government,  including</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  the  current  special  prosecutor,  Kenneth  Starr,  you  might  want  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider evidence of the broader pattern of ties between organized criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise and the White House. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the long run, political corruption at the highest levels makes nonsense</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  conventional  celebration  of  the  possibilities  of  democracy  for  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberate  mastery  of  public  problems.  In  the  Information  Age  it  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">much less important that government be large and powerful than that it be</p>
<p class="calibre1">honest.  Most  of  the  services  that  governments  historical y  provided  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">destined to devolve into the private market in the next mil ennium. But it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubtful  on  the  evidence  from  around  the  world  whether  you  can  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">depend upon a corrupted system with corrupt leaders for the security of your</p>
<p class="calibre1">family and investments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Morris  says,  “[T]he  Clintons  are  not  merely  symptomatic,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">emblematic of the larger bipartisan system at its end-of-century dead end. <a href="#calibre_link-33">”37</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Vito Tanzi, in his essay on corruption, shows that “the only way to deter</p>
<p class="calibre1">corruption is to reduce signi cantly the scale of public intervention. <a href="#calibre_link-33">”38</a> The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Revolution  wil   signi cantly  reduce  “the  scale  of  public</p>
<p class="calibre1">intervention” and on that basis holds out hope for a rebirth of morality and</p>
<p class="calibre1">honesty. The other obvious implication of the Information Revolution for</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality  is  an  increased  vulnerability  that  comes  with  the  possibility  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cybercommerce  and  virtual  corporations  communicating  with  unbreakable</p>
<p class="calibre1">encryption.  Internal  thieves  within  an  organization,  even  a  virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">organization, wil  be more di cult to detect and it wil  be al  but impossible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to recover money that is stolen or received covertly for sel ing trade secrets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">patents, or other valuable economic assets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crime pays, and many  nd it attractive to supplement lawful, productive</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuits  with  unlawful,  predatory  ones.  Unlike  the  usual  situation  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevailed  in  Western  societies  through  most  of  the  past  two  centuries, </p>
<p class="calibre1">criminals are not merely mis ts, without social standing. When crime pays, </p>
<p class="calibre1">430</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-402"></a>you tend to get a better class of criminal because little social odium attaches</p>
<p class="calibre1">to crime. The Sicilian Ma a, for example, along with many drug dealers who</p>
<p class="calibre1">employ local labor at in ated rates, command respect and popular support</p>
<p class="calibre1">on their home turf. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE MORAL ORDER AND ITS ENEMIES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al   strong  societies  have  a  strong  moral  basis.  Any  study  of  the  history  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  development  shows  the  close  relationship  between  moral  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic factors. Countries and groups that achieve successful development</p>
<p class="calibre1">do so partly because they have an ethic that encourages the economic virtues</p>
<p class="calibre1">of self-reliance, hard work, family and social responsibility, high savings, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">honesty. This is also true of social subgroups. The business success of Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly of religious Jews, of the Puritans in New England, of the Quakers</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  British  business  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  or  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mormons  in  modern  America,  al   show  the  economic  bene ts  that  result</p>
<p class="calibre1">from cultures with a strong moral framework. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One can take the Quakers as an example. The Quakers became successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">businesswise,  and  were  particularly  successful  as  bankers,  for  a  number  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons. They set themselves the highest possible standard of trustworthiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  would  not  swear  oaths,  but  regarded  every  business  commitment  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">being as binding as an oath. “My word is my bond” was for them an absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">principle.  They  believed  in  a  quiet  style  of  living,  decent  but  frugal.  As  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious  duty,  they  avoided  spending  money  on  the  vanities  of  this  world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They avoided quarrels, and thought war was always sinful. They thought that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the businessman had a moral obligation to give fair value, and as merchants</p>
<p class="calibre1">they  developed  a  reputation  for  maintaining  high  quality  with  moderate</p>
<p class="calibre1">prices.  “Caveat  emptor”&mdash;let  the  buyer  beware&mdash;was  not  good  enough  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.  In  an  age  when  most  merchants  fol owed  a  high-price,  high-margin</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory  of  trade,  the  Quaker  morality  led  them  natural y  to  a  low-margin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-turnover policy. As Henry Ford later showed, this can be potential y far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more pro table. They fol owed this business policy because they thought it</p>
<p class="calibre1">their duty not to cheat their customer, but it turned out to be the best way to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expand  their  businesses.  The  Quakers  proved  good  people  to  do  business</p>
<p class="calibre1">with,  so  their  customers  came  back;  there  were  pro ts  on  both  sides.  As  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">431</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-442"></a>high-saving community, which honored its obligations, the Quakers had an</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage as bankers, and membership in the Quakers was itself a business</p>
<p class="calibre1">asset which inspired con dence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately such business advantages can be eroded by the very success</p>
<p class="calibre1">they produce. Countries go through a cycle, which formed the basis of Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ferguson’s  sociological  theory  in  the  eighteenth  century,  from  poverty  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard work, to riches, to luxury, to decadence, and on to decline. The ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">Romans  themselves  looked  back  to  the  virtues  of  the  Republican  period, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when the Empire was being built, and deplored the luxury and laziness that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they regarded as the cause of their decline. This erosion of the industrious</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtues by prosperity can happen surprisingly quickly. The Germans are stil  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable and e cient people, but they are not working anything like as hard as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they did when they were rebuilding their country after the rain of defeat in</p>
<p class="calibre1">1945. In two generations, they have gone from working long hours, almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">with their bare hands, in conditions of acute poverty, to working short hours</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the highest pay and the most expensive welfare on earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  October  1995,  the  Petersburg  Declaration  was  signed  by  sixteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">German  associations  of  employers.  It  is  a  catalogue  of  wel -justi ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaints, which re ect the decline in Germany’s industrial morale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Germany’s  tax  burden  reached  record  highs  in  1995,  particularly  due  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solidarity  surcharge  and  payments  for  nursing  care  insurance.  With  total</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate taxation amounting to more than 60 per cent, Germany is far above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the comparative international level of 35 to 40 per cent. Public sector habits</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as regulated promotions, jobs for life and higher pension payments have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  replaced  by  the  free  market  rules  of  meritocratic  promotion  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">compensation.… Due to the fact that Germany has the highest labour costs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the world, wage policies have to contribute to the reduction of unemployment</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  al eviating  the  costs  for  enterprises.…  Wage  increases  should  be  measured</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to competitiveness and productivity.… The behaviour of the unions</p>
<p class="calibre1">has to change. The yearly ritual of campaigns, demands, workers’ mobilization, </p>
<p class="calibre1">threats, and warning strikes is damaging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  anxiety  that  the  Germans,  particularly  the  young  and  the  heirs  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperity, have lost the habit of work is shared by Chancel or Kohl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The existing Volkswagen labor contract gives the highest pay for any car</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers on earth, to which welfare taxes have to be added, in return for a 28-</p>
<p class="calibre1">432</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-364"></a>hour  week&mdash;four  days  of  seven  hours  each.  Postwar  Germany  is  now  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">massive  exporter  of  jobs.  The  British  were  regarded  in  the  middle  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth century as the most e cient industrial nation, a reputation they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had certainly lost a hundred years later. The cycle of prosperity undoubtedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermines virtues of hard work and modest expectations, which exist at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">early  stages  of  successful  industrial  development.  Nations  are  not  able  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">retain their early virtues, just as individuals can become greedy and lazy with</p>
<p class="calibre1">too easy a success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Global  investment  undoubtedly  rewards  these  industrious  virtues  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">penalizes those who become greedy and lazy, as it should. Indeed, one could</p>
<p class="calibre1">say  that  sound  investment  has  to  be  based  on  a  moral  as  wel   as  a  purely</p>
<p class="calibre1">nancial  assessment.  The  Englishman  in  the  eighteenth  century  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">subscribed to the capital of a Quaker bank was likely to do very wel . In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteenth century, the Quakers invested in chocolate businesses, since they</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought  that  cocoa  was  healthier  than  alcohol.  It  probably  is.  Yet  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">investment in Fry’s or Cadbury’s was certainly a good investment. Investors</p>
<p class="calibre1">should  be  concerned  to  avoid  the  periods  of  decadence.  Even  if  Germany</p>
<p class="calibre1">retains a strong position in the European market, and high industrial skil s, </p>
<p class="calibre1">high  labor  costs  and  short  working  hours  have  already  reduced  Germany’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">future potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Social  morality  and  economic  success  are  insolubly  linked.  But  what</p>
<p class="calibre1">factors help to maintain, or tend to undermine, the social morality? Arnold</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toynbee,  the  great  philosophic  historian  of  the  rst  half  of  the  twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century,  formulated  the  theory  of  the  chal enge  and  response.  Societies  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">invigorated by chal enges, and develop virtue they did not even know they</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There has always been a human recognition that hard times may develop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and  normal y  do  develop,  healthier  responses  than  those  of  periods  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperity. In our individual lives, we al  try to make ourselves comfortable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we hope to live in a house that we enjoy, have a job that we like, have enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">money in the bank, and so on. The struggle to achieve these objectives is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewarding one. We study at school, we train ourselves, we work hard at our</p>
<p class="calibre1">business or profession, with these objectives in mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  far  too  many  people  the  achievement  of  these  objectives  creates</p>
<p class="calibre1">something of a trap. The struggle is better than the achievement. The great</p>
<p class="calibre1">433</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-500"></a>Swiss  psychologist  Carl  Jung  had  an  American  businessman  as  his  patient</p>
<p class="calibre1">early in this century. The businessman had these very ambitions as a young</p>
<p class="calibre1">man.  He  had  worked  to  establish  his  own  business,  and  to  make  enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">money  to  retire  by  the  age  of  forty.  He  married  a  young  and  attractive</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman, he bought a beautiful home, he had a young family, his business was</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly successful, and by the age of forty he had indeed been able to sel  out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  retire,  a  rich  and  independent  man  with  nothing  apparently  to  worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">about.  At  rst  he  enjoyed  his  freedom,  was  able  to  do  things  he  had  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised himself. He took his family to Europe. They visited art gal eries and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so on. Gradual y these interests, and his sense of freedom itself, began to pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  started  to  look  back  at  the  time  when  he  was  not  free,  when  he  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">working al  hours at his business and had al  the usual business worries, as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy period of his life. He fel  into a depression, which led his wife to bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to Jung as a patient. Jung diagnosed him, in e ect, as having no outlet for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his creative energy, which had turned in on him, and was destroying him. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">diagnosis  may  wel   have  been  correct,  but  it  did  not  lead  to  a  cure.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman never recovered from his nervous breakdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  human  beings  it  is  the  struggle  rather  than  the  achievement  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters; we are made for action, and the achievement can prove to be a great</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointment.  The  ambition,  whatever  it  may  be,  sets  the  struggle  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">motion, but the struggle is more enjoyable than its own result, even when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">objective is ful y achieved. And, of course, for most people, the objectives can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  achieved  only  partial y.  Most  of  us  do  not  have  as  much  money  as  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">would  like,  and  do  not  live  in  our  dream  house.  We  have  to  settle  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">something less. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This sense that virtue is dynamic, that it consists in the e ort rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  result,  developed  strongly  in  the  nineteenth  century,  and  in  di erent</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways.  There  is  a  wel -known  poem  by  Arthur  Hugh  Clough  that  brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfort to many people in the life-and-death struggle of the Second World</p>
<p class="calibre1">War. It is worth noting that suicide rates in the warring countries fel  in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Second World War; even the struggle of war can be better than the depression</p>
<p class="calibre1">of inactivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Say not, the struggle nought availeth, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The labour and the wounds are vain, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The enemy faints not, nor faileth, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">434</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-415"></a> <i class="calibre4">And as things have been they remain. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars; </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">It may be, in yon smoke concealed, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Your comrades chase e’en now the fliers, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And, but for you, possess the field. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">For while the tired waves, vainly breaking, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Seem here no painful inch to gain, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Far back, through creeks and inlets making, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Comes silent, flooding in, the main. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And not by eastern windows only, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">When daylight comes, comes in the light, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">But westward, look, the land is bright. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This active competition stil  appeals to the modern sensibility. Indeed, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">how many modern men and women lead their lives, in a continuous struggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">to seize the opportunities of a potential y hostile environment. We al  live in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive world, and most of us do not wish to contract out of it. There is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of course, the contemplative spiritual temperament, but it is quite rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  similar  nineteenth-century  perception  of  this  dynamic  morality  was</p>
<p class="calibre1">developed  by  Wil iam  James,  the  greatest  of  American  philosophers,  in  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">address to the Yale Philosophical Club in 1891:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  deepest  di erence,  practical y,  in  the  moral  life  of  man  is  the  di erence</p>
<p class="calibre1">between  the  easy-going  and  the  strenuous  mood.  When  in  the  easy-going</p>
<p class="calibre1">mood the shrinking from present il  is our ruling consideration. The strenuous</p>
<p class="calibre1">mood,  on  the  contrary,  makes  us  quite  indi erent  to  present  il ,  if  only  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater  ideal  be  attained.  The  capacity  for  the  strenuous  mood  probably  lies</p>
<p class="calibre1">slumbering  in  every  man  but  it  has  more  di culty  in  some  than  others  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking  up.  It  needs  the  wilder  passions  to  arouse  it,  the  big  fears,  loves  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">indignation; or else the deeply penetrating appeal of some one of the higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">delities,  like  justice,  truth,  and  freedom.  Strong  relief  is  a  necessity  of  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision;  and  a  world  where  al   the  mountains  are  brought  down  and  al   the</p>
<p class="calibre1">val eys  are  exalted  is  no  congenial  place  for  its  habitation.  This  is  why  in  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">solitary  thinker  this  mood  might  slumber  on  forever  without  waking.  His</p>
<p class="calibre1">435</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-430"></a>various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the same denominational value: he can play fast or loose with them at wil . </p>
<p class="calibre1">This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral energy fal s short of its maximal stimulating power. Life, to be sure, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">even  in  such  a  world  a  genuine  ethical  symphony;  but  it  is  played  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compass  of  a  couple  of  poor  octaves,  and  the  in nite  scale  of  values  fails  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">open up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wil iam James believed that the dynamic morality, which consists in doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather  than  being,  in  acting  rather  than  refraining  from  action,  can  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">extended into the religious sphere. There is also a powerful development of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the morality of competition and survival in the work of Adam Smith (1776), </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas  Malthus  (1798),  and  Charles  Darwin  (1859).  As  this  is  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominant  moral  doctrine  of  the  present  world  economic  order,  its  central</p>
<p class="calibre1">theme needs careful consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dominant  idea  of  Darwinism  is  that  species  survive  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">adaptation  to  their  environment,  and  that  this  process  of  natural  selection</p>
<p class="calibre1">shapes the characteristics of the species. In animals the process is the result of</p>
<p class="calibre1">random  mutations,  which  are  now  known  to  belong  to  a  genetic  process</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darwin himself could only guess at. The survival of human societies depends, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, on cultural choices that are based on human intel igence. Culture</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes human society as genes change other species. Change can therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  place  much  faster  in  our  societies.  It  does  not  have  to  work  through</p>
<p class="calibre1">many generations as it does when it depends on random genetic mutations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  place  of  the  natural  selection  in  animals,  human  beings  have  developed</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultural  selection,  with  some  cultures,  at  some  stage  of  human  history, </p>
<p class="calibre1">developing new technologies that gave them a decisive advantage in wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">creation or mustering power. The cultural edge of new technologies, such as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Iron  Age  man  had  over  Bronze  Age  man,  or  electronic  man  has  over</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanical man, are decisive. Adam Smith may not have been the  rst writer</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  economic  matters  to  reduce  the  welfare  of  nations  to  the  action  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals, but he put it most succinctly and with the greatest authority:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every  individual  is  continual y  exerting  himself  to  nd  out  the  most</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view. But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">436</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-454"></a>study of his own advantage natural y, or rather necessarily, leads him to prefer</p>
<p class="calibre1">that employment which is most advantageous to the society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Malthus, the founder of population studies, saw that the Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith  argument  could  be  applied  not  only  to  the  development  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy of nations but also to the survival of human populations. He is wel</p>
<p class="calibre1">known for his proposition that “Population, when unchecked, increases in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintance  with  numbers  wil   show  the  immensity  of  the  rst  power  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparison of the second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malthus  even  saw,  long  before  Darwin,  that  the  same  principle  applied</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout nature:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand. She has been comparatively, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sparing in the room, and the nourishment necessary to rear them. The germs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expand in, would  l  mil ions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Necessity, that imperious al -pervading law of nature, restrains them within the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prescribed bounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  way  the  world  develops,  even  at  this  stage  of  Adam  Smith  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malthus,  had  already  come  to  be  understood  by  the  end  of  the  eighteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  as  dynamic,  which  it  had  always  been  in  fact.  The  human  species, </p>
<p class="calibre1">itself  one  among  many,  is  forced  to  compete  by  the  mismatch  between  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlimited capacity for generation and its limited ability to grow food. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival  of  human  societies,  as  of  animal  species,  depends  on  successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">adaptation to the environment. A dynamic morality is therefore concerned</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  overcoming  the  problems  of  adaptation.  This  is  best  achieved  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals  who  adapt  their  own  actions  to  the  opportunities  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment, and therefore employ resources available in the society to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greatest advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malthus already saw that Adam Smith’s ideas had changed the world, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he  wrote  that  his  new  argument  about  population  was  not  new:  “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">part  by  Dr.  Adam  Smith.”  He  also  saw  that  this  constant  competition  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">437</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-373"></a>survival was a moral, not merely a practical, matter. The last paragraph of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1798 “Essay” reads:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evil  exists  in  the  world,  not  to  create  despair,  but  activities.  We  are  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">patiently to submit to it, but to exert ourselves to avoid it. It is not only the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest, but the duty of every individual, to use his utmost e orts to remove</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil from himself, and from as large a circle as he can in uence; and the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">he exercises himself in this duty, the more wisely he directs his e orts, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more successful these e orts are; the more he wil  probably improve and exalt</p>
<p class="calibre1">his own mind, and the more completely does he appear to ful l the wil  of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  one  can  il ustrate  Darwin’s  sense  of  the  importance  of  this</p>
<p class="calibre1">argument  from  his  summary  of  the  contents  of  Chapter  3  of  his  epoch-</p>
<p class="calibre1">making book,  <i class="calibre4">On the Origin of Species, </i>  rst published in 1859. He cal ed this</p>
<p class="calibre1">crucial chapter “Struggle for Existence.” The subject headlines are: “Bears on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Natural Selection&mdash;The term used in a wide sense&mdash;Geometrical powers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase&mdash;Rapid increase of naturalized animals and plants&mdash;Nature of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">checks to increase&mdash;Competition universal&mdash;E ects of climate&mdash;Protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the number of individuals&mdash;Complex relations of al  animals and plants</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout  nature&mdash;Struggle  for  life  most  severe  between  individuals  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">varieties of the same species; often severe between species of the same genus&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">The relation of organism to organism the most important of al  relations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since 1776, it has been evident that the best way to optimize the wealth, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations  is  to  al ow  individuals  to  optimize  their  own  return  on  capital  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions  of  free  competition.  Since  1798,  it  has  been  evident  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">relative  survival  of  populations  depended  on  societies  having  su cient</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic  and  political  success  to  be  able  to  feed  themselves,  protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  from  infectious  diseases,  and  protect  their  populations  in  war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since 1859, it has been evident that the whole drama of life, in the human, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the animal, or the vegetable kingdom, consists of a continuous struggle for</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival, in which those species or cultures that are nearest to each other may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  the  greatest  rivals.  This  struggle  requires  a  dynamic  morality,  which</p>
<p class="calibre1">actively wards o  evil and does not merely respond to it when it happens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These ideas have been so powerful that it has been impossible for anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">to think about the nature of humanity, or the problems of morality, since the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time in which they were developed, without responding to them. Karl Marx</p>
<p class="calibre1">438</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-357"></a>believed in the struggle for survival just as much as Charles Darwin, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed it was a war between social classes, themselves formed by economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces.  Adolf  Hitler  believed  in  the  struggle  for  survival,  and  saw  his  own</p>
<p class="calibre1">political  career  almost  exclusively  in  those  terms.  But  he  believed  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle  was  one  between  di erent  races.  Marx,  Lenin,  Stalin,  Mao,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitler  can  al   be  cal ed  social  Darwinists,  in  that  they  saw  the  struggle  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">survival, “Mein Kampf” as Hitler cal ed it, as the central political issue. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marxists saw social classes as though they were separate species; the Nazis saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">races in the same light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, however, makes not a dynamic morality, such as Malthus envisaged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  a  dynamic  immorality.  Both  Marxism  and  Nazism  wished  to  solve  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same  problem,  the  problem  of  the  struggle  for  survival,  but  by  destroying</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition.  They  invaded  foreign  territories,  they  promoted  con ict</p>
<p class="calibre1">between di erent classes who competed for social power, or di erent races</p>
<p class="calibre1">who were seen either as economic exploiters (the normal charge made against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jews by anti-Semites) or as a dangerous underclass (the fear held of blacks by</p>
<p class="calibre1">their white enemies). The Second World War was an attempt by Adolf Hitler, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which failed, to secure an advantage in survival terms of the German people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by  destroying  potential  competition,  particularly  Slavs  and  Jews.  By  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting  paradox,  defeat  in  war  proved  more  advantageous  to  Germany</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the victory of the Nazis could ever have been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The alternative to destructive “interference” competition is col aborative</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition,  and  col aborative  competition  is  the  central  idea  of  Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith,  and  also  of  Malthus  and  of  Wil iam  James.  The  archetype  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">destructive  competition  is  the  conqueror.  He  destroys  his  competitors  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">order to seize their assets, which may include taking over their countries and</p>
<p class="calibre1">may involve the enslavement of their peoples. The archetype of col aborative</p>
<p class="calibre1">competition  is  the  merchant.  It  is  in  the  interest  of  the  merchant  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">customer  should  be  satis ed  with  the  transaction,  because  only  a  satis ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">customer comes back for more trade. It is also in the interest of the merchant</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the customer should be prosperous, because a prosperous customer has</p>
<p class="calibre1">the money to go on buying. Conquest implies the destruction of the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">party;  commerce  implies  the  satisfaction  of  the  other  party.  As  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology  has  made  conquest  an  extraordinarily  dangerous  policy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">commerce has become the only rational approach to the problems of survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">439</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-501"></a>This  interdependence  is  strengthened  by  another  central  idea  of  Adam</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith&mdash;not  new  with  him&mdash;which  is  the  specialization  of  function.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Wealth  of  Nations</i>  starts  with  a  celebrated  passage  in  which  Adam  Smith</p>
<p class="calibre1">observes that “the greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the greater part of the skil , dexterity and judgement with which it is any</p>
<p class="calibre1">where directed, or applied, seem to have been the e ects of the division of</p>
<p class="calibre1">labour.” He points out that “the important business of making a pin is, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some</p>
<p class="calibre1">manufactories, are al  performed by distinct hands.” The more complete the</p>
<p class="calibre1">specialization of function, the more e cient the manufacture is likely to be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but  obviously  such  an  economy  is  highly  interdependent.  If  it  is  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful, it has to be col aborative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A successful social morality must therefore have certain characteristics. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">must be strong&mdash;a weak morality wil  be vulnerable and ine ective. It must</p>
<p class="calibre1">contribute  to  the  struggle  for  survival,  but  in  ways  that  are  col aborative</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather  than  murderous.  Hitler  had  a  strong  morality  of  survival,  but  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">destructive quality nearly destroyed his own society. It must be dynamic, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">match the dynamic changes of modern technology, and indeed of al  modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">social systems. It must be economical y e cient. The mixture of egalitarian</p>
<p class="calibre1">and authoritarian ideas in the Leninist system simply did not work. Yet these</p>
<p class="calibre1">are not al  the characteristics that such a social morality might be expected to</p>
<p class="calibre1">possess. It has a broader purpose of making the society a good one to live in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and of binding people together. Also, moralities have to adapt and survive; a</p>
<p class="calibre1">brittle morality may be acceptable in our generation only to be rejected in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next. A traditional social morality may be too in exible to adapt to successive</p>
<p class="calibre1">changes in social structure. On the other hand a purely relativist system is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">a morality at al ; it gives no clear signals on how to behave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  can  rst  of  al   put  al   social  morality  inside  a  context.  A  strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">community,  even  a  virtual  community,  depends  upon  the  morality  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">widely accepted. The most successful periods in the history of societies tend</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be those in which the col ective morality is ful y shared. Such a morality</p>
<p class="calibre1">not only performs speci c functions such as reducing crime, and helping to</p>
<p class="calibre1">support family and social structures, but gives citizens a sense of purpose and</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction. Such a consensus on morality historical y seems to depend on there</p>
<p class="calibre1">being a dominant religion, whether that is a state religion of the early Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">440</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-352"></a>Empire; the religion of the Jews, which has been the thread of survival for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispersed people; the Islamic religion with its social rules; the Catholicism of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Middle Ages; or the Protestantism of early New England. The three ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a people, a morality, and a religion depend upon one another, and each</p>
<p class="calibre1">tends to reinforce the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  such  a  moral  society,  the  individual  citizen  is  able  to  work  toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal  objectives  inside  a  framework  of  social  support.  Admittedly  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral  laws  may  be  somewhat  arbitrary,  or  at  least  may  appear  arbitrary  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">outsiders. The Orthodox Jew loses the freedom to eat pork or shel sh, or to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work  on  the  Sabbath.  The  loyal  Catholic  may  lose  the  freedom  to  use</p>
<p class="calibre1">arti cial contraceptives, let alone to have an abortion. The Moslem may lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  freedom  to  drink  alcohol.  The  pious  Confucian  may  have  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inconveniently  long  period  of  mourning  for  his  reverend  father&mdash;even</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confucius  himself  warned  that  mourning  rituals  could  be  exaggerated.  Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">the adherent to each of these systems of belief regards these observations as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smal  price to pay for a shared and coherent sense of world order, in which</p>
<p class="calibre1">the individual has a settled place. An Orthodox Jew could wel  argue that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">observance of the Sabbath is a smal  price to pay for the bene ts of the Law or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the strength of the Jewish family. A shared morality in a tolerant society was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ideal of John Locke and of early philosophers of liberty. They did not at</p>
<p class="calibre1">al  believe that a society, of any kind, can be maintained without rules, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they thought that the rules ought to be subject to the best of reason, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">people  should  be  coerced  to  accept  only  the  essential  rules.  They  did</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize that coercion was inevitable in social morality, particularly in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection of life or of property, because they considered that no society can</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive if there is no security. They applied an almost absolute tolerance to</p>
<p class="calibre1">variations in personal choices that did not a ect the welfare of others. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confucian, mourning his father for forty days, could live next door to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jew, honoring the Sabbath, without either disturbing the other, or wanting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to coerce him into fol owing his own religious practices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From this combined doctrine of social morality in essential matters and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tolerance in personal decisions, one actual y gets a core moral standard that</p>
<p class="calibre1">has to be imposed on al  citizens and a voluntary ethic that citizens accept as</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals or as members of subgroups in society. When a Benedictine monk</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes  vows  of  poverty,  chastity,  and  obedience,  he  does  so  as  a  member  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">441</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-320"></a>such a subgroup. He does not cal  on al  Catholics, let alone on al  his fel ow</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens,  to  take  the  same  vows,  or  to  observe  the  same  rules.  He  wil   be</p>
<p class="calibre1">obedient to the orders of his abbot, but he does not expect anyone outside his</p>
<p class="calibre1">abbey to pay any attention to them. The adherence to these optional parts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">social morality does not need to be universal, but the core morality does have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  be  shared,  and  people  who  wil   not  accept  the  core  morality  damage</p>
<p class="calibre1">society as wel  as themselves. In the extreme example, a society overrun with</p>
<p class="calibre1">robbers who do not hesitate to murder, as large parts of Europe were after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fal   of  the  Roman  Empire,  o ers  nobody  a  satisfactory  life,  not  even  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">robbers  themselves;  they  are  always  particularly  threatened  by  other</p>
<p class="calibre1">murderers. This is equal y true of some inner-city areas of the United States</p>
<p class="calibre1">today. Anarchy is not the ideal society, because without the enforcement of</p>
<p class="calibre1">law there is no human security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When one looks at the forces that are hostile to the morality of society, one</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs to consider this core morality, which is broadly similar in most modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious belief systems. Two, at least, of the Ten Commandments of the Old</p>
<p class="calibre1">Testament, for Christians, or the Torah, for Jews, can be regarded as universal</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  anything  one  could  recognize  as  a  religion:  “Thou  shalt  not  kil ”  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thou  shalt  not  steal.”  One  can  even  go  beyond  that.  Almost  al   serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">agnostics  would  regard  both  murder  and  theft&mdash;the  ultimate  threat  to  life</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  the  ultimate  threat  to  property&mdash;as  forbidden,  and  would  accept  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">society has the right to punish people who kil  or rob. They might disagree</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the appropriate punishment for a particular crime, but not about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right of society to punish as such. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The original phrase of John Locke has it precisely. Everyone has a right to</p>
<p class="calibre1">“life, liberty and estate.” In 1776 Thomas Je erson added another of John</p>
<p class="calibre1">Locke’s phrases, “the pursuit of happiness.” That makes a very  ne phrase, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and a very  ne aspiration, but “life, liberty and estate” is more down to earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">than “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Society depends absolutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the right to life and the right to property. In practice history shows that</p>
<p class="calibre1">these  rights  can  be  protected  only  when  there  is  liberty.  If  the  state  is  al -</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful,  then  the  state  becomes  the  great  enemy  of  life,  as  in  wars  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggression, and of individual property, by taking an inordinate share of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">national wealth for its own often undesirable and always wasteful purposes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">442</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-303"></a>The core morality is, however, under attack in the most advanced nations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">partly by the very forces of modernity that give these nations their technical</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge.  The  United  States  is  the  world’s  leading  technological  power.  Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">people, including most Americans, would have regarded the United States as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a moral example to the rest of the world at any time up to the early 1960s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  that  view  is  seldom  expressed,  even  by  Americans  who  are  proud  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their country. One could not listen, as the world did, to the O.J. Simpson trial</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  regard  the  United  States  as  the  simple  virtuous  Republic  it  began  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one looks back at the labels of the old America, they re ected the needs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a frontier society, which colored the attitudes of its citizens even in the big</p>
<p class="calibre1">cities. Frontiers are democratic places. People feel themselves to be equal, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  early  Americans  threw  o   the  class  hierarchies  of  Europe.  Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">indentured  laborers,  sent  over  from  England  as  prisoners,  established</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves  as  independent  tradesmen,  farmers,  or  free  laborers  once  their</p>
<p class="calibre1">indenture period was over. Wages were higher than in Europe, and the cost of</p>
<p class="calibre1">essentials  was  low,  though  imported  manufactures  were  expensive.  On  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frontier itself people depended very much on one another, but the living, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard, was a good one by European standards. Immigrants might start as low</p>
<p class="calibre1">wage earners in the slums of Boston and New York, but they usual y escaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the slums quite soon, and generation after generation found prosperity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the Civil War, the blacks saw themselves as though they were another</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrant  group,  and  many  of  them  shared  these  American  values  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">objectives. From these the black middle class developed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This aspiration, strengthened by the actual experience of the frontier, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the in uence of the churches, both Protestant and Catholic, framed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patriotism of Americans. They believed that they lived in God’s own country, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a notion uniquely guided by democratic ideals and Christian faith, the  rst</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  most  successful  of  the  world’s  democracies.  The  picture  is  familiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough; it is personi ed in the image we al , or almost al , have of Abraham</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lincoln,  though  one  can  stil   nd  some  Americans  in  the  South  who  see</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lincoln  as  the  man  who  unleashed  the  horrors  of  the  rst  modern  war  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent free states from leaving a Union they no longer trusted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the image of Lincoln, craggy, simple, honest, and eloquent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is stil  the supreme American image, and it is essential y a moral one. Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">443</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-436"></a>Americans stil  feel the vivid original contrast between the democratic energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  new  country  and  the  tired  hierarchies  of  Europe.  This  ideal  of  an</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential y  dynamic  meritocracy  is  hard  for  the  foreigner  to  recognize  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">present-day Los Angeles, New York, Houston, or Washington, even though</p>
<p class="calibre1">its  traces,  and  something  more  than  traces,  can  stil   be  found  in  the  great</p>
<p class="calibre1">suburban belts or in the rural areas. The American Puritan ethic, with al  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">historic  importance,  survives  best  north  of  the  snowline,  but  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurial dynamism is more widespread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans would point to the decay of the big cities, which have become</p>
<p class="calibre1">breeding  grounds  for  crime,  especial y  the  narco-business,  as  the  worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">symptom of the decline of a communal sense of morality. Most Americans</p>
<p class="calibre1">also  recognize  that  there  is  a  clash  of  several  di erent  moral  cultures,  al</p>
<p class="calibre1">competing  in  their  claims  and  their  authority.  The  “political y  correct” </p>
<p class="calibre1">culture rejects many, but not al , of the moral principles that upheld the old</p>
<p class="calibre1">culture. It aggressively emphasizes the role and the rights of groups who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen as having been historical y exploited by a dominant white male culture, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and rejects that culture, despite its being the founding culture of the United</p>
<p class="calibre1">States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dominant  male  culture  of  the  rst  half  of  the  twentieth  century</p>
<p class="calibre1">centered  on  the  survival  of  the  nuclear  family.  This  historical y  gave  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband-father at least a nominal dominance in the home, though in practice</p>
<p class="calibre1">the home was often run by the wife-mother with the often meek acceptance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  nominal  master.  It  gave  the  male  boss  a  real  dominance  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">workplace,  a  dominance  that  the  feminist  movement  has  so  far  chal enged</p>
<p class="calibre1">but not reversed. The interest of the family, and historic Christian teaching, </p>
<p class="calibre1">outlawed abortion. The old morality thought abortion was unlawful kil ing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was never al owable, and the adherents of the traditional morality stil  think</p>
<p class="calibre1">that. Adherents of the new morality think the opposite. In  <i class="calibre4">Roe</i> v.  <i class="calibre4">Wade</i> the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Supreme  Court  based  the  constitutional  right  to  abortion,  which  had</p>
<p class="calibre1">hitherto been regarded as a question for the individual states, on the doctrine</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a right to privacy, itself remote from any language actual y to be found in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Constitution or its amendments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A woman’s privacy was held to include the right to have or not to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">children, whatever the consequences to the embryo might be. The Supreme</p>
<p class="calibre1">Court  did  not  regard  the  embryo  as  enjoying  any  constitutional  rights&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">444</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-321"></a>embryos  being  the  same  extraconstitutional  entities  in  the  late  twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century that slaves had been in the  rst half of the nineteenth. “Life, liberty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the pursuit of happiness” did not apply to slaves, and the language of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Declaration of Independence was not applied to embryos by the justices in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Roe</i> v.  <i class="calibre4">Wade. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The abortion debate is the extreme example of the con ict between the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old and new morality, though there are equal y remarkable con icts in other</p>
<p class="calibre1">areas where the old social organization with its morality has been chal enged</p>
<p class="calibre1">by  the  new.  Traditional  Christian  morality,  in  Protestant  and  Catholic</p>
<p class="calibre1">churches  alike,  laid  great  emphasis  on  sexual  roles:  No  heterosexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">intercourse outside or before marriage. No genital homosexual relationships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lesbianism  was  less  emphasized,  because  society  hardly  recognized  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence.  When  Queen  Victoria  was  rst  told  of  it,  she  stoutly  refused  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe that such things happened between women. Political correctness is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality of supposedly oppressed groups. The homosexuals claimed an equal</p>
<p class="calibre1">validity for their lifestyle, and chal enged the traditional opposition to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual  conduct.  “Homophobia”  was  regarded  as  being  itself  an  outrageous</p>
<p class="calibre1">form of prejudice, like racial discrimination. To be critical of gays is regarded</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the new morality as being as unacceptable as being critical of blacks, Jews, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time other sexual taboos were being eroded or abolished. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  1960s  there  was  a  new  wave  of  free  love,  partly  based  on  the  apparent</p>
<p class="calibre1">security  of  the  female  contraceptive  pil ,  but  also  promoted  by  mood-</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing drugs and pop music. It led to an increasing amount of nonmarital</p>
<p class="calibre1">cohabitation.  By  the  1990s  it  was  thought  absolutely  normal  in  Britain,  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather more old-fashioned society than most of the United States, for Prince</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward to sleep with his girlfriend at Buckingham Palace, in the same stable</p>
<p class="calibre1">but unmarried intimacy that students were sleeping with each other in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">1960s lodgings. Few people thought it odd that Queen Elizabeth II, the head</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Church of England, condoned her youngest son’s conduct, her three</p>
<p class="calibre1">elder  children’s  marriages  having  already  broken  down.  Those  few  who</p>
<p class="calibre1">complained  were  regarded  as  hopelessly  out  of  date  and  priggish.  Yet  there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were stil  many people who regarded the old morality as preferable, even if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they did not practice it themselves, or seriously expect their children to do so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond a fairly early age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">445</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-502"></a>The political y correct movement has had its own puritanical side. Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it  sprang  from  the  perceived  interests  of  women,  seen  as  the  largest  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppressed  groups,  it  had  a  certain  hostility  to  male  sexuality,  both  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggressive  and  in  what  would  previously  have  been  regarded  as  harmless</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms. Some women took the view that al  men were by nature rapists, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the natural horror at rape was exaggerated into a general denunciation of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">male  gender.  Others  concentrated  on  sexual  harassment,  a  real  grievance&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">many men have very crude sexual manners&mdash;which became ludicrous in some</p>
<p class="calibre1">trivial cases. Sexual harassment was even al eged in mere looks, without any</p>
<p class="calibre1">word being uttered, let alone physical contact. As a result the new morality</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be very censorious. White people could be accused of racial prejudices, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not because they were prejudiced but because they were white. Men could be</p>
<p class="calibre1">accused  of  sexual  harassment  because  their  expressions  showed  that  they</p>
<p class="calibre1">found a woman attractive, something that in an earlier generation had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">regarded as a compliment rather than an insult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  political y  correct  and  the  fundamentalist  Christian  groups  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitterly critical of each other, yet in the modern world they look rather alike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They both assume the authority of a particular moral doctrine as though it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were universal, even though their moral doctrines are di erent. Both indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">can  be  criticized  for  the  same  defect,  for  an  exaggerated  and  overcon dent</p>
<p class="calibre1">moralism,  lacking  in  depth,  in  historic  sense,  or  in  tolerance.  Both  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">attacked for their supposed resemblance to seventeenth-century Puritanism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the self-con dent moralists like Oliver Cromwel  in England&mdash;he nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">emigrated  to  New  England&mdash;or  the  Salem  witch  hunters.  Neither  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">women’s  movement,  in  its  more  dogmatic  form,  nor  the  conservative</p>
<p class="calibre1">preachers of the Bible belt can be accused of any lack of morality, but of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">overdevelopment and rigidity. The heart of these moralities sometimes seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to  have  turned  to  stone.  This  sort  of  hardening  of  the  moral  arteries  is  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">damaging  to  the  consensual  morality  of  society  as  the  “anything  goes” </p>
<p class="calibre1">anarchy against which it protests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  distortion  of  moral  forces,  a  coarsening  into  self-righteousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pharisaism,  the  conviction  that  one  is  uniquely  virtuous,  is  as  old  as</p>
<p class="calibre1">humankind,  and  was  particularly  o ensive  to  Jesus  Christ.  The  erosion  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality,  the  belief  that  ethical  choices  are  purely  a  matter  of  private</p>
<p class="calibre1">preference, as much a matter for the individual as the choice of clothes, is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">446</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-358"></a>more  recent  phenomenon.  This  belief  re ects  the  absence  of  any  shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality at al . It takes to a quite new stage the classical doctrine of liberty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and turns “the pursuit of happiness” from what John Locke original y meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the phrase, and Je erson understood by it in 1776, into a hedonism that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckless of consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The phrase “the pursuit of happiness” is taken from John Locke’s  <i class="calibre4">Essay on</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Human Understanding</i> (1691): “the highest perfection of intel ectual nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies in a careful pursuit of true and solid happiness, so the care of ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  our  liberty.”  He  does  go  on  to  say  that  “everyone  does  not  place  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness in the same thing.… the mind has a di erent relish as wel  as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">palate.…  Men  may  choose  di erent  things,  yet  al   choose  right,  supposing</p>
<p class="calibre1">them only like a company of poor insects, whereof some are bees, delighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">with  owers and their sweetness, others beetles delighted with other kinds of</p>
<p class="calibre1">viands.” Yet he goes on to argue that to prefer vice to virtue is “manifestly a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong judgement.” He puts particular weight on the religious argument, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">considers also that “wicked men have the worse part here.” He believes that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“morality, established upon its true foundations, cannot but determine the</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice in anyone who wil  consider.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Lockean  doctrine  of  liberty  undoubtedly  gives  a  wider  range  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">human preferences than more authoritarian moral systems that seek to treat</p>
<p class="calibre1">al   people  alike,  and  impose  uniformity  of  conduct.  Yet  soon  the  classic</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctrine  of  liberty  recognizes  the  need  for  col ective  moral  imperatives, </p>
<p class="calibre1">including respect for other people in society, particularly their lives and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">peaceful ownership of their possessions under the law. A general erosion of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the col ective morality threatens liberty, both directly, in that it introduces an</p>
<p class="calibre1">element  of  anarchy,  and  indirectly,  by  encouraging  the  most  authoritarian</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces of society. We can see the history of public morality as a cycle between</p>
<p class="calibre1">disorder  and  authoritarianism;  the  modern  authoritarian  moralities,  both</p>
<p class="calibre1">feminism  and  fundamentalism,  have  emerged  as  a  cyclical  response  to  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hedonism of the 1960s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We have already described some of the attributes of the new world of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next century. It wil  be shaped by two main forces, the shift of technology</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  is  opening  up  the  economies  of  Asia  and  the  new  global  electronic</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications that are making the citizen progressively less dependent on</p>
<p class="calibre1">447</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-300"></a>his or her local government. The new technology wil  replace, or has already</p>
<p class="calibre1">replaced, many of the middle human skil s&mdash;the production line worker, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">o ce  clerk,  now  increasingly  the  middle  manager.  But  it  has  rewarded  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rarer skil s, creating an international cognitive elite of highly skil ed people for</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom the new communications open up the widest possible market for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil s. Like most elites, the cognitive elite tend to be a bit above themselves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">are  rather  arrogant,  and  think  they  can  set  their  own  standards.  They  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">alienated from society as a result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During the  rst half of the next century there wil  be a massive transfer of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealth from the Old West to the New East. Political failures&mdash;and China is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stil   a  political y  backward  country&mdash;may  delay  this  transfer  of  wealth  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic power, but are most unlikely to prevent it. They cannot reverse it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  process  of  the  shift  in  wealth  would  in  any  case  put  the  greatest</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible  pressure  on  the  white-dominated  countries  of  the  Northern</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hemisphere, on Europe and North America. At present about 750 mil ion</p>
<p class="calibre1">people,  belong  to  the  advanced  countries  of  this  area;  until  very  recently</p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan  was  the  only  Asian,  nonwhite  country  to  have  reached  the  Euro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">American  standard  of  living,  though  there  were  ethnical y  European</p>
<p class="calibre1">populations  in  New  Zealand,  in  Australia,  and  in  the  white  population  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">southern  Africa.  Even  in  1990,  the  total  population  of  the  advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial countries was only about 15 percent of the world population of 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">bil ion. The shape of the distribution of the world’s wealth was 15 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich, 85 percent poor, very like the income distribution in advanced industrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies  a  hundred  years  ago.  By  2050,  in  an  accelerating  process,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">expectation  is  that  the  advanced  economies  wil   include  about  3  bil ion</p>
<p class="calibre1">people out of a world population that may have risen to 7 bil ion, or a wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution of 40 percent rich, 60 percent poor. By the end of the century</p>
<p class="calibre1">these  gures could wel  be reversed, and the distribution could be 60 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich and 40 percent poor, with poverty particularly concentrated in Africa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  shift  between  nations  wil   be  toward  a  greater  equality  of  wealth,  but</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside nations it wil  probably be toward greater inequality. The e cient users</p>
<p class="calibre1">of talent and capital wil  have a decisive advantage over those with moderate</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil s  or  little  capital.  This  wealth  wil   be  highly  mobile.  The  poor  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">advanced world wil  not be able to tax the rich on the twentieth-century scale; </p>
<p class="calibre1">those countries that try to do so wil  fal  back in an intensely competitive race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">448</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-353"></a>Of course, the total productivity of the world economy wil  continue to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rise, perhaps by an average of 3 percent over the whole world, if there are no</p>
<p class="calibre1">world wars. If that proves correct, the total world product wil  double every</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty- ve years, making it more than four times as large as it is now by 2050, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and sixteen to twenty times as large by 2100. Even if the world population has</p>
<p class="calibre1">increased to 8 bil ion by 2100, that wil  give the world GDP per head by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end of the century ten times its present level. Such an increase in wealth can</p>
<p class="calibre1">take  care  of  the  rise  in  the  new  industrial  societies,  and  the  multimil ion-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dol ar  incomes  of  the  cognitive  elite,  and  stil   provides  a  decent  and  rising</p>
<p class="calibre1">standard of living for the rest of the advanced workforce. But the di erentials</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  be very di erent from those of the twentieth century. In world terms the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor nations wil  see their incomes grow much faster than those of the rich</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations; in national terms, the incomes of the rich, as in the America of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1990s, wil  grow much faster than middle or low incomes. In the next century</p>
<p class="calibre1">we  shal   witness  the  creation  of  a  world  superclass,  perhaps  of  500  mil ion</p>
<p class="calibre1">very rich people, with 100 mil ion being rich enough to emerge as Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  process  wil   have  an  inevitable  consequence.  Societies  wil   become</p>
<p class="calibre1">much  less  homogeneous;  the  nation-state  wil   become  weaker,  or  crumble</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether; the cognitive elite wil  see itself as cosmopolitan. Already people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who work in the same global functions are developing a culture that is much</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer to that of their fel ow workers in other parts of the world than to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fel ow  citizens  in  the  old  nation-states.  A  London  investment  banker  wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably feel more at home in Seoul than he wil  in Glasgow; a Washington</p>
<p class="calibre1">civil  servant  may  feel  more  at  home  in  Bonn  than  in  black  areas  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Washington itself. We can already see the splintering e ect that this process</p>
<p class="calibre1">has  on  moral  values.  The  morality  of  the  individual  is  partly  framed  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">education, by what the individual has been taught as a child; it is also partly</p>
<p class="calibre1">framed by experience of life. Both the education and the experiences of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive  elite  wil   be  cosmopolitan,  and  wil   tend  to  divorce  people  from</p>
<p class="calibre1">their local communities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we move toward the next century, a high proportion of people in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing cognitive elite have been given little religious or moral education in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  family.  The  commonest  religion  of  the  elite  is  an  agnostic  humanism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many  such  families  are  themselves  split  by  divorce,  remarriage,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">449</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-361"></a>subsequent  third  marriages.  The  marriage  pattern  in  Hol ywood  is  not</p>
<p class="calibre1">universal in the United States, but the cognitive elite in Euro-America has a</p>
<p class="calibre1">high divorce rate, probably averaging a third or more. The children of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorced parents seldom have a basic religious education, and are aware of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">variations of moral attitude between parents, stepparents, and step-siblings. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">one compares the initial moral education of this group with that of an Irish</p>
<p class="calibre1">or Polish vil age, the peasant education obviously provides much the stronger</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious training of the two. A godless, rootless, and rich elite is unlikely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be happy, or to be loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  inadequacy  in  the  initial  moral  education  of  what  wil   be  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominant economic group of the next century is likely to be reinforced by</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  life  experience.  These  people  wil   have  the  discipline  of  an  advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">technical education, of one sort or another, to  t themselves for their new</p>
<p class="calibre1">role as the leaders of the new electronic universe. But they wil  learn from that</p>
<p class="calibre1">only some of the moral lessons that have historical y been the framework for</p>
<p class="calibre1">human social conduct. By the standards of Confucius, Buddha, or Plato (500</p>
<p class="calibre1">B.C.), St. Paul (A.D. 50), or Mahomet (A.D. 600), they may be moral il iterates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  wil   have  been  taught  the  lessons  of  economic  e ciency,  the  use  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources,  the  pursuit  of  money,  but  not  the  virtues  of  humility  or  self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacri ce, let alone chastity. Essential y most of them wil  have been brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">up as pagans with a set of values closer to those of the late Roman Republic</p>
<p class="calibre1">than to Christianity. Even these values wil  be highly individualistic, rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than  shared.  Societies,  as  we  have  argued,  can  only  be  strong  if  real  moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">values are widely shared. The advanced nations are already moving into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation where many people wil  hold weak or limited moral values, others</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil  compensate with  erce adherence to irrational values, and few values wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">be  held  in  common  across  the  whole  of  society.  No  doubt,  some  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“competitive territorial clubs” that we described earlier wil  impose exacting</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral standards for residence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Di erences  in  wealth  have  not  in  themselves  historical y  produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">fundamental di erences in religious values. In dense and stable societies with</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong traditions, a steep hierarchical structure. “the rich man in his castle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the poor man at his gate,” may conceal values that run through the hierarchy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but this depends upon the strength of the communal feeling of the rich and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the poor, and the strength of the social traditions. Neither of these conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">450</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-503"></a>exists now, and both community feeling and tradition are being weakened by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the economic and technological revolution that is taking place. The lives of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the many and the few are becoming more and more distant from each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The technological revolution has been achieved by breaking away from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old ways of doing things. In every  eld it has been the radical who has won, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and the conventional thinker who has fal en behind, who has literal y fal en</p>
<p class="calibre1">out  of  the  race.  Our  politics  may  be  led  by  conventional  thinkers&mdash;Bil</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clinton, Helmut Kohl, John Major&mdash;but our most successful businesses are</p>
<p class="calibre1">led by radicals with a keen understanding of the new technological world; the</p>
<p class="calibre1">archetype  is  Bil   Gates.  Conventional  thinking  has  been  discredited  by  its</p>
<p class="calibre1">inability to deal with the rapidity and the sheer force of change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet morality is not like that. If we take the science of Moses, formed about</p>
<p class="calibre1">1000 B.C., it has very little to tel  us. The account of the creation in the Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Genesis may wel  contain a theological truth&mdash;God made the universe and</p>
<p class="calibre1">humankind&mdash;but  it  does  not  give  a  scienti c  account  of  the  actual</p>
<p class="calibre1">development of physical structures. Yet if we take the morality of Moses&mdash;the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten Commandments&mdash;that has a great deal to tel  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Respect  for  parents  and  faithfulness  in  marriage  are  the  best  ways  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserve  family  life;  family  life  is  the  best  way  to  bring  up  moral y  healthy</p>
<p class="calibre1">children.  Stealing  damages  the  thief  and  the  people  from  whom  things  are</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolen, and is a disincentive to work and saving. Social order depends on the</p>

<p class="calibre1">In  science,  three  thousand  years  completely  changed  what  human</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge  is;  in  morality,  we  may  actual y  have  fal en  back.  The  average</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychotherapist probably gives the patient less good moral advice on how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead his life than the average Jew would have received from his teacher in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">period of Moses. Of course, Christianity itself is stil  available, but it is for</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of the world a pale ghost of its former self. Few people have the faith of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the earlier ages, or even of the less sophisticated communities; one does not</p>
<p class="calibre1">look for saints on Park Avenue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The destruction of tradition has been a necessary condition of scienti c</p>
<p class="calibre1">progress. If we al  stil  believed that the sun revolved around the earth, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">we  could  not  have  developed  satel ite  communications.  Indeed  what  we</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe  to  be  science  itself  is  only  a  series  of  hypotheses,  imperfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanations  due  to  be  replaced  by  other  explanations,  stronger  but  stil</p>
<p class="calibre1">451</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-322"></a>imperfect. Yet the destruction of tradition has been a disaster to the moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">order of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confucius  taught  that  we  should  always  behave  with  moderation  (he</p>
<p class="calibre1">cal ed  the  Golden  Mean   <i class="calibre4">chum  yum, </i>  at  least  as  it  was  translated  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeenth-century  scholars).  He  also  taught  that  we  should  respect</p>
<p class="calibre1">authority  and  treat  others  as  we  would  wish  to  be  treated  ourselves.  That</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaching is twenty- ve hundred years old. As a tradition it in uenced China</p>
<p class="calibre1">for al  recorded history, but Confucianism seems an outmoded tradition to</p>
<p class="calibre1">many  modern  Chinese,  who  do  not  value  moderation,  who  respect  force</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than authority, and certainly do not treat others as they would wish to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be treated themselves. With the loss of tradition, societies can lose the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">vocabulary of their moral consensus. China, with al  its advancing power, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">now  a  moral y  backward  country  compared  to  Tibet,  impoverished  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppressed as the Tibetans are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A good social morality has certain characteristics. It should contribute to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the survival of society and of individuals, in a dynamic rather than static way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  should  include  tolerance  and  avoid  self-righteousness.  It  should  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious,  rather  than  merely  agnostic.  It  should  not  pretend  to  decide</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions of scienti c fact. It should be neither anarchic nor authoritarian. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be widely shared and deeply held. Such a social morality is particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">important  to  the  family  and  to  the  raising  of  children  as  independent  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible adults. It provides the focus of a good society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We  nd  that  any  such  morality  is  supported  by  the  logic  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">interdependence  that  comes  from  commerce  and  fel ow-feeling,  but  is</p>
<p class="calibre1">threatened by the attacks of a facile scientism, by the alienation of a superclass</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  a  subclass,  by  the  loss  of  the  rootedness  of  the  old  geographical</p>
<p class="calibre1">economies. Perhaps there wil  be a reaction against these trends. They must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be recognized as extremely dangerous to the societies of the next century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As what Isaiah Berlin cal ed “the most terrible century in Western history” </p>
<p class="calibre1">winds down, the age of giantism in social structure also draws to a close. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">nal days of the twentieth century are destined to be a time of downsizing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution,  and  reorganization.  It  wil   be  the  time  of  the  social  dinosaurs</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapped in the tar pit. And a time of scavengers. Birds wil  pick the bones of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinosaurs. Governments, corporations, and unions wil  be obliged to adjust</p>
<p class="calibre1">against their inclinations to new metaconstitutional conditions established by</p>
<p class="calibre1">452</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-334"></a>the penetration of microtechnology. It has profoundly shifted the boundaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">within which violence is exercised. Today’s world has already changed more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than we commonly understand, more than CNN and the newspapers tel  us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  it  has  changed  in  precisely  the  directions  indicated  by  a  study  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">megapolitical conditions. As we argued  rst in  <i class="calibre4">Blood in the Streets</i> and then in</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The Great Reckoning, </i> when change occurs in technology or the other factors</p>
<p class="calibre1">that set the boundaries where violence is exercised, the character of society</p>
<p class="calibre1">inevitably changes with them. Everything that is attached to the way humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">interact,  including  morality  and  the  common  sense  of  the  way  we  see  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, wil  change as wel . After a period of slack morality, which is indicative</p>
<p class="calibre1">of  the  end  of  an  era,  we  wil   see  the  awakening  of  a  sterner  morality,  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">more exacting demands to meet the more exacting requirements of a world of</p>
<p class="calibre1">competitive sovereignty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several features of the new morality can be foreseen. For one thing, it wil</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasize  the  importance  of  productivity  and  the  correctness  of  earnings</p>
<p class="calibre1">being retained by those who generate them. Another corol ary point wil  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">the importance of e ciency in investment. The morality of the Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">Age  applauds  e ciency,  and  recognizes  the  advantage  of  resources  being</p>
<p class="calibre1">dedicated  to  their  highest-value  uses.  In  other  words,  the  morality  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age wil  be the morality of the market. As James Bennett has</p>
<p class="calibre1">argued, the morality of the Information Age wil  also be a morality of trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cybereconomy  wil   be  a  high-trust  community.  In  a  setting  where</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbreakable encryption wil  al ow an embezzler or thief to securely place the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeds of his crimes outside the range of recovery, there wil  be a very strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">incentive to avoid losses by not doing business with thieves and embezzlers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  rst place. Just as in the example of the Quakers cited earlier, a reputation</p>
<p class="calibre1">for honesty wil  be an important asset in the cybereconomy. In the anonymity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of cyberspace, this reputation may not always apply to a known person, but it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   be  reliably  veri able  through  identi cation  of  cryptographic  keys.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibility for radiating di culties if encryption or certi cation of encrypted</p>
<p class="calibre1">identities becomes corrupted by gangsters or others is daunting enough that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it should strongly militate against the hiring of any person whose behavior</p>
<p class="calibre1">could  be  indicative  of  a  lack  of  trustworthiness.  Bennett  envisions  “A</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentleman’s  Club  of  Cyberspace,”  protected  areas  that  would  require</p>
<p class="calibre1">heightened  security  measures  for  participation,  “possibly  using  biometric</p>
<p class="calibre1">453</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-293"></a>validation such as voice-print identi cation. The proprietors would assume</p>
<p class="calibre1">the responsibility of vouching for the identity of the participants and to some</p>
<p class="calibre1">extent  their  trustworthiness,  achieving  a  ‘gentleman’s  club  in  cyberspace’</p>
<p class="calibre1">(although ladies would be welcome these days). In these areas, people could</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry on transactions with greater security and con dence than in the general</p>
<p class="calibre1">realm  of  cyberspace.  Thus  the  twenty- rst  century  may  see  a  return  to  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victorian-like emphasis on trustworthiness and character in an environment</p>
<p class="calibre1">no Victorian could have envisioned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The protected areas of cyberspace may also o er guarantees to reduce risk</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar to the extraterritorial guarantees of protection o ered by the Counts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Champagne to protect merchants traveling to and from Champagne fairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other  jurisdictions  actual y  “indemni ed  traveling  merchants  against  any</p>
<p class="calibre1">losses  they  might  incur  while  passing  through  the  territory  under  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction of the given noble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guards of the Fair,” o cials original y appointed by the counts, provided</p>
<p class="calibre1">security and a “tribunal of justice” for merchants at the fair. They ultimately</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolved  into  more  independent  entities,  with  a  separate  seal,  notarizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">contracts  and  enforcing  performance,  with  the  power  to  “bar  from  future</p>
<p class="calibre1">fairs  any  trader  found  guilty  of  not  paying  his  debts  or  ful l ing  his</p>
<p class="calibre1">contracted promises. This was evidently so severe a penalty that few wil ingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">risked this denial of opportunities for future pro t. Short of that, however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the guards could seize the goods of a defaulting debtor and sel  them for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene t of his creditors.” <a href="#calibre_link-33">39</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ostracism as means of enforcement of contracts declined in importance</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  the  number  of  alternative  markets  rose.  With  the  new  information</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology now available, however, ostracism of cheats and those defaulting</p>
<p class="calibre1">on  contracts  could  again  be  a  potent  enforcement  mechanism  with  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragmented sovereignties of the next stage of society. Computer linkages can</p>
<p class="calibre1">police cyberspace with unforgeable information about credit and fraud. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  world  wil   be  in  this  sense  particularly  a  smal   community,  cheats  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">frauds wil  be discouraged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  emphasizing  the  morality  of  earnings  and  e ciency  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">placing a renewed stress on character and trustworthiness, the new morality is</p>
<p class="calibre1">also likely to stress the evil of violence, particularly kidnapping and extortion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">454</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-294"></a>which  wil   grow  in  importance  as  means  of  “shaking  down”  individuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose resources wil  not otherwise be easy prey to crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stil  another likely spur to sterner morality wil  be the end of entitlements</p>
<p class="calibre1">and income redistribution. When the hope of aid for those fal ing behind is</p>
<p class="calibre1">based primarily upon appeals to private individuals and charitable bodies, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wil   be  more  important  than  it  has  been  in  the  twentieth  century  that  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">recipients  of  charity  appear  to  be  moral y  deserving  to  those  voluntarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispensing the charity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In  some  ways  the  new  information  world  wil   be  better  positioned  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">encourage  seriousness  over  moral  issues.  The  promises  of  income</p>
<p class="calibre1">redistribution  that  enframed  expectations  among  the  unlucky  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsuccessful in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe have also had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a  perverse  e ect  international y.  There  is  strong  evidence  suggesting  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign  aid  and  promises  of  intervention  to  forestal   famine  and  increase</p>
<p class="calibre1">living standards have been major factors stimulating population growth that</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeds the carrying capacities of backward economies. The startling growth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of world population since World War II, with its often destructive impact on</p>
<p class="calibre1">forests, soils, and water resources, can be traced to intervention on a global</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale.  This  intervention  short-circuited  the  negative  feedback  consequences</p>
<p class="calibre1">that had long kept local populations in balance with the resources needed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">support them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, many who lived in local environments with few resources and</p>
<p class="calibre1">little  or  no  growth  were  only  too  pleased  to  be  assured  that  constraining</p>
<p class="calibre1">limitations of their vil age life could be put aside. They eagerly adopted the</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic  message  carried  by  international  aid  workers,  Peace  Corps</p>
<p class="calibre1">volunteers, local revolutionaries, and the competing ideologues of the Cold</p>

<p class="calibre1">wrong message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">455</p>

<p class="calibre1">make  those  who  lived  in  nonindustrial  civilizations  and  adhered  to</p>

<p class="calibre1">missions  to  counter  famine  and  disease,  and  technical  intervention  fooled</p>
<p class="calibre1">many into believing that their life prospects had sharply improved&mdash;without</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  necessity  on  their  part  of  updating  their  values  or  signi cantly  altering</p>
<p class="calibre1">their behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">International income redistribution not only encouraged an unsustainable</p>
<p class="calibre1">surge in the world’s population, it contributed in important ways to cultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">relativism and widespread confusion over the crucial role of culture in  tting</p>
<p class="calibre1">people to prosper in their local environment. Today most people believe that</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultures are more matters of taste than sources of guidance for behavior that</p>
<p class="calibre1">can mislead as wel  as inform. We are too keen to believe that al  cultures are</p>
<p class="calibre1">created  equal,  too  slow  to  recognize  the  drawbacks  of  counterproductive</p>
<p class="calibre1">cultures.  This  is  especial y  true  of  the  hybrid  cultures  that  have  begun  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerge  in  the  hothouse  of  subsidy  and  intervention  in  many  parts  of  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world in this century. Like the criminal subculture of America’s inner cities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they retain incoherent bits and pieces of cultures appropriate to earlier stages</p>

<p class="calibre1">Heretofore, the history of human societies is that they have tended to evolve</p>
<p class="calibre1">in  the  direction  of  greater  “complexity”  or  sociopolitical  control.  Smal</p>
<p class="calibre1">hunting and gathering bands evolved into agriculture states, which gave way</p>
<p class="calibre1">to larger-scale industrial nation-states. As archaeologist and historian Joseph</p>
<p class="calibre1">A. Tainter writes in  <i class="calibre4">The Collapse of Complex Societies, </i> “Human history as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole has been characterized by a seemingly inexorable trend toward higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">levels  of  complexity,  specialization,  and  sociopolitical  control.…” <a href="#calibre_link-34">2  </a>Now, however,  the  emergence  of  the  next  stage  of  economic  development,  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information  Society,  promises  to  reverse  the  apparently  “inexorable  trend” </p>
<p class="calibre1">toward greater levels of centralization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tainter’s work raises many interesting questions pertinent to the themes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this book. For example, if Tainter is correct in supposing that devolution of</p>
<p class="calibre1">centralized control and less redistribution of resources imply col apse, then it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  unlikely  that  the  industrial  nation-state  in  its  current  form  could  long</p>
<p class="calibre1">coexist with devolved microstates hosting Sovereign Individuals. The nation-</p>
<p class="calibre1">states may be incapable of surviving on a diet of stable, much less diminished, </p>
<p class="calibre1">resources.  As  Tainter  details,  when  hypertrophied  systems  have  exhausted</p>
<p class="calibre1">their  potential,  as  we  believe  nation-states  have  today,  “the  Law  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">457</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-296"></a>Diminishing Marginal Returns” frequently sets in. In “many crucial spheres” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the  returns  for  increased  investments  in  centralized  sociopolitical  control</p>
<p class="calibre1">decline, or even become negative. Hence, the phenomenon of “Parkinson’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Law,”  in  which  the  number  of  employees  and  expense  of  operating  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">British Admiralty skyrocketed over the twentieth century, while the number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ships in the British Navy shrank dramatical y. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar manifestations of the “Law of Diminishing Returns” are certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">in evidence in the United States and other leading economies as the twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">century  draws  to  a  close.  As  Roger  Lane,  Professor  of  Social  Sciences  at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haverford Col ege, wrote in “On the Social Meaning of Homicide Trends in</p>
<p class="calibre1">America,” “the old institutions of social control&mdash;law, schools, police, prisons</p>
<p class="calibre1">&mdash;have lost their e ectiveness, despite frequent infusions of manpower and</p>
<p class="calibre1">money.” <a href="#calibre_link-34">3 </a>There is unambiguous evidence of increasing costs for the overal</p>
<p class="calibre1">burdens of government. For example, total taxes rose from 27.8 percent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S. median income in 1957 to 37.6 percent in 1997. <a href="#calibre_link-34">4</a> This is a strong hint, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">not absolute proof, of diminishing marginal returns on the whole range of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government activity in the United States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the past, sharply diminishing marginal returns have been a prelude to</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse.  The  argument  of  this  book  is  that  the  increased  capacity  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals  to  protect  their  transactions  and  their  assets  from  predatory</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxation implies a decline in the redistribution of resources, along with less</p>
<p class="calibre1">centralized social control, less regulation and regimentation, and, ultimately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">devolution  of  territory.  Al   these  developments  have  historical y  been, </p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested in “col apse.” In Tainter’s terms, “col apse” is what happens when</p>
<p class="calibre1">a centralized control system is no longer worth what it costs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whenever  we  have  a  threshold  phenomenon,  whether  in  physical, </p>
<p class="calibre1">biological  or  social  systems,  the  con guration  of  the  system  at  the  moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">when  the  threshold  is  reached  becomes  unstable  and  the  slightest,  even</p>
<p class="calibre1">in nitesimal  displacement  in  the  con guration  in  the  proper  direction  leads</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventual y to a  nite change in the con guration of the system. Therefore a</p>
<p class="calibre1">change  in  the  behavior  of  a  single  individual,  no  matter  how  smal ,  may</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitate  in  an  unstable  social  con gurational  process  that  leads  to  a  nite</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sometimes radical change.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-297"></a>While most individual adaptations to change are admittedly marginal and</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutionary  in  character,  there  can  be  revolutionary  “paradigm  shifts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes,  even  great  empires  tumble  as  a  consequence.  The  marginal</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teturns  from  further  investment  in  centralized  control  can  become  so</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelmingly negative that it is no longer economical y rational for most</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals to continue to support the old system. Tainter explains the fal  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the  Roman  Empire  in  these  terms.  In  his  words,  “If  accounts  are  to  be</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed, at least a portion of the overtaxed peasantry openly welcomed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">relief they thought the barbarians would bring from the burdens of Roman</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule. And a much larger portion were evidently apathetic to the impending</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse.…  The  costs  of  empire  had  risen  dramatical y,  while  in  the  face  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbarians’ successes the protection that the State could o er to many of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizens  proved  increasingly  ine ectual.  To  many,  there  were  simply  no</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining  bene ts  to  the  Empire,  as  both  barbarians  and  tax  col ectors</p>
<p class="calibre1">crossed and ravaged their land. As Gunderson notes, ‘… the net value of local</p>
<p class="calibre1">autonomy exceeded that of membership in the Empire.’ Complexity was no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer  yielding  bene ts  superior  to  disintegration,  and  yet  it  cost  so  much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.” <a href="#calibre_link-34">6</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tainter quotes other authorities in support of his thesis that col apse can</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring  “with  it  a  corresponding  rise  in  the  marginal  return  on  social</p>
<p class="calibre1">investment:” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zosimus,  a  writer  of  the  second  half  of  the  fth  century  A.D.,  wrote  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thessaly and Macedonia that, ‘… as a result of this exaction of taxes city and</p>
<p class="calibre1">countryside were ful  of laments and complaints and al  invoked the barbarians</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sought the help of the barbarians.’… ‘[B]y the  fth century,’ concludes R. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Rashevsky’s analysis of the “role of determinism versus indeterminism” in</p>
<p class="calibre1">history emphasizes the vulnerability of systems to radical change that can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitated  even  by  a  single  individual  when  the  system  becomes  unstable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  reaches  a  “threshold”  condition.  When  conditions  are  ripe  for  change</p>
<p class="calibre1">(such  as  when  diminishing  marginal  returns  for  supporting  a  centralized</p>
<p class="calibre1">system  no  longer  yield  “bene ts  superior  to  disintegration”),  then  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity  for  a  radical  change  is  so  robust  that  practical y  anyone  can</p>
<p class="calibre1">459</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-298"></a>precipitate  it.  Rashevsky  writes,  “The  individual  who  precipitates  a  nite</p>
<p class="calibre1">change  does  not  have  to  be  an   <i class="calibre4">exceptional</i>  individual.  He  may  be   <i class="calibre4">any</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">individual. The situation is analogous to that in a physical system, where at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">point of instability an accidental displacement of any one of the tril ions of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">identical</i> molecules precipitates a  nite transition to a stable state. <a href="#calibre_link-34">”8</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">We  cannot  specify  who  wil   precipitate  the  col apse  of  the  overgrown</p>
<p class="calibre1">nation-state system, or when it wil  happen. But extrapolating from Tainter’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">and  Rashevsky’s  analyses  of  the  dynamics  of  social  change,  we  can  foresee</p>
<p class="calibre1">col apse coming. The most developed and heretofore successful nation-states</p>
<p class="calibre1">are al  characterized by dwindling populations and massive, unfunded old-age</p>
<p class="calibre1">pension liabilities. Absent unprecedented immigration from underdeveloped</p>
<p class="calibre1">countries, or an unexpected in ux of angels wil ing to work overtime and pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">con scatory  tax  rates,  leading  states  in  Europe,  North  America,  and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Australasia  wil   fal   far  short  of  the  revenues  needed  to  maintain  the  social</p>
<p class="calibre1">bene ts currently delivered. Actuaries forecast rising taxes and lower bene ts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">i.e., diminishing marginal returns, especial y for entrepreneurs who shoulder</p>
<p class="calibre1">a disproportionate share of the tax burden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IRS  gures  show  that  one-tenth  of  one  percent  of  Americans  paid  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority of income taxes in the United States as of 1997. These are precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">the persons to whom e cient minisovereignties can o er new opportunities</p>
<p class="calibre1">for  domicile  at  a  negligible  cost  in  taxes.  The  di erence  between  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">protection  costs  of  a  commercialized  sovereignty  and  the  predatory  taxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">imposed  by  the  old  nation-states  could  amount  to  the  equivalent  of  many</p>
<p class="calibre1">mil ions or even bil ions of dol ars in lifetime income. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conventional  microeconomics  is  based  upon  the  proposition  that</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals who spot a $100 bil  in the street wil  pick it up. Opportunities to</p>
<p class="calibre1">save mil ions or bil ions would be tens of thousands or mil ions of times more</p>
<p class="calibre1">compel ing.  People  wil   act  in  the  indicated  way  when  faced  with  choice</p>
<p class="calibre1">between con rming their costly al egiance to institutions beset by declining</p>
<p class="calibre1">marginal  returns,  or  shifting  to  new  arrangements  that  demand  less  and</p>

<p class="calibre1">460</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-330"></a>The argument of this book clearly informs the decision to redeploy your</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital,  if  you  have  any.  Citizenship  is  obsolete.  To  optimize  your  lifetime</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnings  and  become  a  Sovereign  Individual  you  wil   need  to  become  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">customer of a government or protection service rather than a citizen. Instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of paying whatever tax burden is imposed upon you by grasping politicians, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you wil  be better positioned to prosper in the Information Age by freeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself to negotiate a private tax treaty that obliges you to pay no more for</p>
<p class="calibre1">services of government than they are actual y worth to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Based upon the history of other dominant systems facing col apse, those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who opt for the  <i class="calibre4">ultimum refugium</i> and get out early wil  be better o  for</p>
<p class="calibre1">having done so. This is already evident in the rash of laws passed during the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1990s  to  penalize  Americans  renouncing  citizenship.  The  dangers  of  a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nationalist reaction to the crisis of the nation-state make it important not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">underestimate the scope for tyranny and mischief. Not withstanding the fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that  the  right  to  expatriate  is  enshrined  in  the  U.S.  Declaration  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independence, the U.S. is likely to be one of the more tyrannical jurisdictions</p>
<p class="calibre1">blocking the emergence of commercialized sovereignty. You should aim never</p>
<p class="calibre1">to leave your money in any jurisdiction that claims the right to conscript you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">your children, or your grandchildren. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever your current residence or nationality, to optimize your wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">you should aim to primarily reside in a country other than that from which</p>
<p class="calibre1">you hold your  rst passport, while keeping the bulk of your money in yet a</p>
<p class="calibre1">third jurisdiction, preferably a tax haven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To better acquaint yourself with the alternatives, we recommend that you</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel  widely  to  visit  attractive  locales  where  you  might  wish  to  secure  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right to reside in an emergency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you are truly ambitious, you may even wish to carve out a minisover-</p>
<p class="calibre1">eignty of your own. We provide contacts in the appendices who can help you</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiate  your  own  tax-free  zone,  or  zona  franca,  from  a  recognized</p>
<p class="calibre1">government  that  is  prepared  to  sublet  its  sovereignty  under  the  right</p>

<p class="calibre1">Suppose you are just starting out…</p>
<p class="calibre1">But suppose you agree with the premises of this book and are excited by</p>

<p class="calibre1">sovereignty? What do you do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  recipe  for  easy  success  is  bound  to  disappoint.  Opportunities  to</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed abound as a consequence of the Information Revolution. Which one</p>
<p class="calibre1">is  right  for  you  to  capture  is  beyond  our  scope  to  say.  If  you  are  intent  in</p>
<p class="calibre1">accumulating  capital  in  order  to  realize  your  ful   potential  as  a  Sovereign</p>
<p class="calibre1">Individual, you should make it one of your priorities to study and evaluate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the works of the various gurus who attempt to teach useful hints about how</p>
<p class="calibre1">to succeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any  good  business  bookstore  or  one  of  the  on-line  booksel ers,  like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amazon.com, can o er you a wide selection of manuals on success. Read as</p>
<p class="calibre1">many as you can, not with the idea that any one set of rules wil  automatical y</p>
<p class="calibre1">make you  nancial y independent, but with the understanding that success is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a choice. If you are to succeed, you must arm yourself with the perspective</p>
<p class="calibre1">and habits that characterize successful persons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you are stil  at the stage of selecting a career, resist the temptation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumping  to  an  easy  conclusion  that  the  best  route  to  success  in  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Information Age is to become a computer programmer. Yes, it is true that</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmers  have  been  in  great  demand  as  the  Information  Revolution</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolded in the last quarter of the twentieth century. But as computational</p>
<p class="calibre1">power  has  increased,  arti cial  intel igence  has  developed  apace.  A  company</p>
<p class="calibre1">cal ed Authorgenics has already demonstrated the capacity to create object-</p>
<p class="calibre1">oriented  software  without  programmers.  You  won’t  be  highly  paid  by</p>
<p class="calibre1">studying  to  do  something  that  can  be  done  with  Aladdin’s  Lamp.  The</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem with specializing in software or any other rapidly evolving  eld at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the center of the Information Revolution is that your area of expertise could</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon be outdated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This underscores the wisdom of the traditional liberal education, which</p>
<p class="calibre1">aimed to encourage students to develop their critical faculties and thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">skil s. Success in business, as in most areas of life, depends upon being able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">solve problems. If you can teach yourself how to solve problems, you have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright  career  ahead  of  yourself.  No  matter  where  you  live,  you  wil   nd</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems galore in need of solving. In most cases, those who would bene t</p>
<p class="calibre1">from solutions of their problems wil  pay you handsomely to e ect them. </p>
