<p class="calibre1">His own theories tend to refute it. If humans are emotional animals who derive their sense of purpose from the rituals they perform with others, then the gradual suppression of emotions and the elimination of ritual in our highly bureaucratic society should produce considerable malaise. Such, in fact, were the more pessimistic conclusions of Weber and Freud. Although Durkheim did not want to draw this conclusion, his evidence on anomic suicide resulting from the loosening of ritual social bonds supports a pessimistic interpretation. THE REVOLUTIONARY PHILOSOPHY OF GEORGES SOREL One of Durkheim's compatriots drew the implications better than he did. This was Georges Sorel (1847-1922), a retired engineer, whose values and politics were as far removed from Durkheim's as possible, although both men held each other in considerable respect. Sorel was an acquaintance, among others, of V. I. Lenin, Benito Mussolini, and Fritz Ebert (the Socialist who became the first president of Germany after World War I). His politics seemed an equally bizarre flux, from monarchism on the far right to anarcho-syndicalism on the far left. But there was a basic principle underlying Sorel's shifting political sympathies. He regarded modern society as completely decadent, lacking in any real virtue, dedication, or brilliance. He despised the petty squabbling of the academics, and saw the business world as entirely self-seeking and corrupt and politicians as equally contemptible. The failure of the Socialists to take a stand on the burning moral issue of the Dreyfus affair at the time when Zola was putting his life on the docket convinced Sorel that the organized left was equally decadent. By 1907, when he wrote Reflections on Violence, Sorel had come to identify with ultrarevolu- tionary anarcho-syndicalism. Reflections on Violence takes up the anarcho-syndicalist idea that a general strike of all workers will someday bring down bourgeois society and usher in the new era of the revolution. This revolution, says Sorel, is a myth. It will never be, for society after the revolution would not be greatly changed, and in any case the chances of victory are nil. But—and here is where Sorel parts company with most other "practical" thinkers—the myth of the general strike nevertheless serves a purpose. It unifies the group of workers and gives them a feeling of participating in a moral cause. In the same way, violence has an important value, for it unifies individuals in a struggle for their common ideals and against their common enemies. In modern society, says Sorel, only social movements in battle have this high moral tone, a sense of joyous spontaneity as individuals feel themselves dedicated to something greater and higher than themselves. For this reason, such revolutionary movements are the only source of value today, even if they are doomed to fail. It is not the actual goal that counts, but the feelings that go along with struggling to attain it in the company of others. Sorel throws light on the appeal of violence in modern society, although his analysis applies just as well to nonviolent movements. The civil-rights</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement and its succeeding peace and student movements of the mid- 1960s often had much of the sense of euphoria among their participants that Sorel describes as the main value of such movements. And if these movements have generally failed to bring about their goals, that does not make them any the less worthwhile. Sorel's lesson foreshadows later existentialist insights: that in a world of dilemmas and well-entrenched injustices, the value of an action is to be judged less by consequences than by its intrinsic Tightness. Sorel has always been a puzzling figure, since his point of view lends itself to many interpretations. Sorel himself defended the Communist revolution in Russia, while Mussolini praised him as a source of Italian fascism. But Sorel was not really a Fascist. He did not want a society that tries to impose an imitation of old-fashioned order by brutal suppression; his values, rather, were for the spirit of perpetual movement. More than anything else, Sorel was a true anarchist. And whatever the political implications that could be drawn from his work, Sorel clearly pointed out two characteristic phenomena of modern society: its emotional starvation and the irrelevance of its ideals to workaday reality. This was more than Durkheim allowed himself to see, although he spent most of his life probing the conditions of the same feelings of solidarity. Durkheim wanted very strongly to believe in something, and in the end it cost him his life. World War I turned his ardent French nationalism into a paroxysm of anti-German sentiment. When his son Andre was killed at the front, defending the flag that Durkheim considered the modern version of the most sacred object, Durkheim went into a depression that culminated in 1917 in his death. It was not the first time that an individual's insights, so valuable to others, had gone unused by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER SEVEN Max Weber: The Disenchantment of the World Max Weber (1864-1920) has exerted more influence than any other social scientist except Marx and Freud. His ideas had wide currency, first in Germany and then throughout the scholarly world. His term "charismatic leadership" has passed into general usage, and all of social science knows something of the concepts of legitimacy, bureaucracy, rationalization, ver- stehen, ideal types, value-free science, the three-dimensional approach to stratification, and the Protestant ethic with its links to the origins of capitalism. Yet Weber's general sociology and his vision of world history are as yet barely known; they remain hidden behind isolated selections and popularizations, and we are continually surprised as more and more powerful portions of Weber's worldview are brought into the light. Weber himself is partly to blame. His works are voluminous but unfinished and scarcely succinct, and even a superficial acquaintance with them turns up notions of such utility that one is tempted to inquire no further. In recent years, as the fuller discovery and development of his sociology go on, Weber increases his hold on our attention. The most commanding figure of the great period of German social scholarship, Weber still towers over the world scene more than seventy years after his death. Like many other great sociologists, Weber (pronounced "Vay-ber") was a man at the center of things, pulled loose from illusion by constant exposure to contradictory points of view. Born in 1864 into a prosperous family of German industrialists, he grew up in Berlin where his father was a judge and a successful politician. Backstage acquaintance with the realpolitik of Bismarck's empire made Weber a political realist from his childhood. His father sat in the Reichstag with the National Liberals, representing the interests of the big manufacturers and standing between the Junker aristocracy on the right and the Social Democrats (socialist labor unionists) on the left. It was not a propitious time for liberals in Germany (indeed, it rarely ever was, except during the short-lived revolution of 1848). The landowning aristocracy and the army took a rigid stand against democracy, and the Socialists preached revolution according to Karl Marx. The liberals had no 117</p>
<p class="calibre1">one to turn to except the state bureaucracy, and their ideals went down the drain as their nationalism increasingly became their only political resource. From an early age Weber scorned the unrealistic claims of left and right, but found himself increasingly uncomfortable with the center. Throughout his life an ardent nationalist, he nevertheless saw Germany blundering steadily into a war that would destroy it. His sociology confirmed his fears of imminent disaster, and Weber came to see himself as a twentieth-century Jeremiah, prophesying doom. He began a career like his father's, studying law at Heidelberg and Berlin. But his pessimism about politics and his own overpowering urge to exercise his independent intellect steered him into an academic career. Germany in the nineteenth century led the world in the eminence of its universities. It was especially prominent in the historical fields. It had been here that Leopold von Ranke and Friedrich von Savigny transformed history from the status of antiquarian chronicles into a science, with its canon to tell things "as they really were." With German thoroughness, the Herr Professor Doktors had produced detailed accounts not only in conventional military and political history but also in economic, legal, and cultural history and in archaeology, ethnography, and linguistics. German philosophy, too, since the days of Hegel had a strong historical flavor. Weber trained himself in virtually all these fields, with the result that his knowledge of world history probably exceeded that of any other person who had ever lived. In an age of growing specialization Weber's feat was the mark of an extraordinary individualist. But Weber was nothing if not extraordinary. Tall, stout, black-bearded, and moody, he impressed all who met him. His colleagues viewed him as a towering intellect. At the end of Weber's doctoral exam Theodor Mommsen, the most eminent historian of his day, rose and said that he knew of no man better qualified to succeed him "than the highly esteemed Max Weber." But Weber stood in an intellectual circle even wider than the world of German historians and philosophers. At his father's house he had met the eminent politicians and academicians of Berlin. In his own house at Heidelberg the leading intellects in all fields, as well as artists and musicians, met. Among his circle would be found such men as Karl Jaspers (the future existentialist psychiatrist), Ferdinand Toennies, Georg Simmel, and a young radical who could not get a university position despite Weber's intercessions on his behalf, Robert Michels. Weber was fully acquainted with Marxist underground thought. He read many languages, traveled broadly, and knew the English evolutionists and the French positivists as well as the German historians. He was a one-man crucible for the intellectual currents of the nineteenth century, and from his central position he forged a viewpoint for sociology as both a science and a study of meaningful human creations. His twin methods of verstehen and ideal types emerged from his position at the center of intellectual crosscurrents: Social reality is not merely to be explained by mechanical analogies to the natural world, but must be understood (in German, verstehen) by imagining oneself into the experiences of men and women as they act out their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own worlds. Ideal types, as we shall see below, are the tools for making scientific generalizations out of our understanding of this infinitely complex and shifting world. Sociologists must sympathetically understand the people around them—indeed, also those who have been dead for centuries—and they are bound to feel acutely what is closest to home. Here, too, Weber was at the center of powerful antagonisms. Beneath the surface of a proper German bourgeois family, Weber's father and mother carried on psychic war. His father—harsh, self-righteous, and authoritarian—clashed incessantly with his altruistic, self-denying, and religious mother. Between the two poles Weber may have discerned the remnants of a rigid Protestant ethic whose discovery is his most famous contribution. Certainly Max Weber himself was a prime example of the ethic. Immensely hard working, impeccably honest, dedicated, serious, methodical, he drove himself with an inner vehemence that left him an insomniac for years and dead at the age of fifty-six. The family conflict finally took its toll. In 1897 when Weber was thirty- three and just beginning his career as a professor of economics at Heidelberg, he became involved in a quarrel while visiting his parents. Years of suppressed bitterness broke through the respectable patrician formalities, and Weber angrily threatened to break off all contact with his father if he did not change his treatment of his mother. Not long after, he heard the news: His father had fallen dead of a stroke. Depression set in. A powerful, even charismatic, lecturer, Weber found he could no longer teach. When he tried, his arms and back became temporarily paralyzed. He found it difficult to speak; serious thinking was impossible. He took a leave of absence from his job, finally resigning it entirely. He traveled incessantly, yet spent hours in hotel rooms staring at his fingernails. He spent several weeks in a mental institution. The experience opened a new side in him. "Such a disease has its compensations. It has reopened to me the human side of life," he wrote his wife. "An icy hand has let me loose. In years past my diseased disposition expressed itself in a frantic grip upon scientific work, which appeared to me as a talisman. . . ." Slowly he began to recover, and in 1904 he was back at work. He took a trip to America on an invitation to speak at the St. Louis World's Fair. The loftiness of American ideals and the corruption of American capitalism fired his imagination, and he returned to Germany to finish his first famous work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. From then on his production never flagged, although he was unable to bring himself to teach until the end of his life, after the close of World War I. He had lost seven years. The work of the next sixteen has never been surpassed. Weber's sociology is often obscured behind the maze of crosscutting definitions that make up the opening chapters of Economy and Society, his major work. Clear and distinct concepts are essential to make sense out of a subject as complex as the workings of society. But concepts are easiest to grasp if we can see them as they are actually put to use. Weber set himself the task of explaining the greatest development of world history: the rise of</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern industrial civilization. In order to do this he had to push his sights progressively back from economics to law, politics, and religion; to chart the interconnections between kinship and stratification, bureaucracy and warfare, until every institution was connected with every other, and the web of explanation stretched from the present to the beginnings of human life on earth. In exploring the question of economic development, Weber created nothing less than a sociology of world history. His contributions to general sociological theory consist of the models he developed in an effort to grasp the key processes of society without doing violence to the complexities of history as it actually occurred. Weber had nothing but contempt for evolutionist or cyclical theories that blindly simplified the facts to fit a few preconceived principles of growth. In his tightrope walk between vague or inaccurate generalizations and the myriad particular forms of world civilization, Weber moved toward a comprehensive theory of humankind's social behavior and of the institutions humankind creates. We shall take up first Weber's general sociology, then his vision of world history. WEBER'S SOCIOLOGY: STRATIFICATION, ORGANIZATIONS, AND POLITICS Stratification: Class, Power, and Status Weber's sociology centers around three interrelated subjects: stratification, organizations, and politics. Of these, stratification provides the core theory of society, to which all else is related and within which may be found the forces that move society. Weber was a thoroughgoing nominalist; for him, real people in real physical places are the subjects and movers of all that exists and happens in society. To be sure, cultural ethos (such as the Protestant ethic), legal systems, and large-scale organizations all have their own logical structures and laws of development. But they never develop by themselves; they develop through the thought and action of real people. Weber might well have adopted Marx's slogan as his methodology: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please." Weber could not accept a reified abstraction like "Society" as it appeared in organic analogies, nor the Weltgeist (world spirit) of Germanic cultural theorists. We never see society, but only groups of men and women. Furthermore, these groups are very different, even within one society. It is an error to suppose that the ethical philosophies of the upper classes express the beliefs of middle-class shopkeepers or peasant laborers. India cannot be summed up in Brahmin philosophy, nor Germany in Hegel. If we are to understand society and culture we must begin with the actual diversity of separate groups, not with some easy generalization based on a single perspective. Stratification, for Weber, provided the link between the diverse groups we can actually observe and the invisible order through which</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands and millions of individual actions add up to results that individuals neither intend nor control. What kind of order is it that ties people to others whom they may never see? Weber found three such orders: economics, politics, and culture. A man sells his labor in a factory that exists only because of a nationwide division of labor, and he affects the price of goods by the ways he spends his wages; he pays taxes and is killed on a distant battlefield because far-off government ministers struggle for power; his family walks in a funeral ceremony elaborated long ago by a hierarchy of priests and changed slowly from one repetition to another. Each order affects humans' behavior, lays down the conditions within which they must make their lives, determines both their views of the world and which people they will associate with. But not all people are affected alike. The life chances of the financier's son are not those of the farm laborer's; the ordinary citizen's worldview is not that of the party leader; the pious housewife does not inhabit the social milieu of the intellectual. We can see the social order comprehensively if we think of it as a stratification of individuals into groups based on similar economic, political, or cultural positions. Groups of people who associate together are the basic units of society. Much research since Weber's day has shown that it is in such face-to-face groups that people acquire their identities, their values, and their worldviews. Thus the diversity of society is produced by its major institutions—businesses, states, armies, churches, schools. At the same time the members of the various groups are tied together through their positions in these institutional networks. Weber did not find it necessary to ask the general question of what holds society together. He saw that societies over the sweep of history were always coming together and falling apart, shifting and changing from one set of institutions to another. History shows nothing permanent but continual war, conflict, and change: states conquering and disintegrating, trade and finance spreading and shrinking, religions and arts slowly shifting from one theme to its opposite. What does remain beneath the change, the concrete basis of human society, are groups of people bound by ties of common feeling and belief: families, households, kinspeople, church and cult members, friends, communities. The core of Weber's view of stratification is thus a theory of group formation, a set of hypotheses about the conditions that bring people together into solidaristic groups. These conditions are found in the way people relate to the institutional orders that link groups together into a society. Weber accepted certain motives as a basis for an explanation of human behavior: need for food and material comfort; fear of death and avoidance of physical pain; desire for sexual gratification, for membership and status in a social and moral community, and for a meaningful view of the world. Weber did not attempt to explore the psychological dynamics of these motives or to account for individual differences in motivation; in these respects his theories may be complemented by the insights of Freud and Mead and by the social theories concerning group solidarity of Durkheim and his fol-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lowers. Weber took these motives as given because he found them manifested throughout human history. They enter his theories as the three main sanctions by which people influence each other's behavior: offers of economic gain, threats of physical coercion, and appeals to emotion and belief. Economics, politics, and culture are corresponding institutional realms; class, party ("power group" might be a preferable term), and status groups are the groups formed on their bases. Weber's central hypothesis is that people who share common positions and interests in the economic arena, in the political struggle, or in the realm of culture are likely to act and associate together and to exclude all others from their company of equals. In the economic market classes are formed as people come together with others who experience similar work conditions. Here Weber follows Marx's discovery: The peasant laborer, the factory worker, the skilled craftsperson, the rural landlord, the industrialist, the merchant, the stock-market speculator all inhabit distinct social worlds. Material conditions have a powerful effect on people's lives, throwing factory laborers together in urban tenements and drawing country gentry together in their round of visits between estates. Economics shapes not only how people live and in whose company, but also how they see the world and how they will act. Economic position gives people distinctive interests: The worker sees an advantage in demanding higher pay, forming a union, or supporting a Socialist party; the peasant tries to keep down his duties to his lord and his taxes to the king; the industrialist opposes unionization and socialism; the financier is concerned about the price of gold and the prevailing rate of interest on loans. People are thus moved to act on their economic interests, and the resulting conflict draws individuals of similar economic position closer together and isolates them from those of opposing positions. How many such opposing groups there will be and how extensive the conflict among them depend on the nature of the economic system in that particular society and on the relationships between economic stratification and political and cultural stratification. Weber incorporates Marx's basic model into his theory of stratification, but he sees economic determinism as only one of three factors. Weber viewed politics, like economics, as a realm in which struggle is widespread. History, after all, reads most obviously as a record of military conquests and feudal rivalries, palace intrigues and coups d'etat, peasant revolts and urban insurrections; the activities of peaceful eras consist of the ups and downs of politicians' careers, the shifting authorities of officials, and the power play of interest groups in voting and lobbying. Thus, individuals may be stratified by their political interests as well as by their economic interests. Minor government officials are drawn together in a distinct group, as are military officers, independent feudal knights, modern party politicians, or municipal judges. Coercive power is a scarce good; many people are concerned with getting as much of it for themselves as possible, and virtually all people wish to make it bear on themselves as little as possible. As we shall see below, politics may be analyzed as a continual struggle</p>
<p class="calibre1">to gain authority for oneself and to evade subjection to the authority of others. Political interest groups may overlap with economic interest groups— feudal knights may represent the landowning class; politicians, the classes of industrialists or workers. But power is a separate pie to be carved up, capable of inducing alignments of its own. The kinds of political stratification and political group formation in a particular society depend on the nature of its political institutions. It should be apparent by now that Weber saw society as a complex and ever-shifting interplay of forces. Political stratification is influenced by economic alignments and vice versa; both of these interact with cultural stratification. Weber was forced to devise a strategy for talking coherently about this world in which nothing ever stays put long enough for us to pin a label on it and in which our labels always oversimplify what is going on. For this purpose he conceived the notion of the ideal type, by means of which he could abstract from reality a form of social action that is rarely or never found by itself. We can discover the dynamics of stratification, for example, if we mentally decompose it into its constituent elements—the ideal types of class, power group, and status group. We can thereby discover the dynamics of economic class formation without having to bear in mind the processes of power politics. Having done this, we can successively take up political struggles and the status-producing effects of culture. Finally, we can apply these insights to the overall stratification of any society resulting from the interaction of these three processes. The technique is similar to that of the chemist, who explains the properties of a compound first by identifying its constituent elements and then by noting their interactions. The modern sociological research method called the "multivariate analysis" of survey data reflects the same general strategy. The interaction of culture with economics and politics is especially subtle. As already noted, economic and political positions have considerable influence on the values and beliefs of their occupants. Marx was the first to notice this for economics, and Weber carried out a parallel analysis of politics. We can speak, then, of economic and political determinants of culture. But there is a third way in which culture enters stratification, a discovery of Weber's own. If culture were merely the result of economic and political position, one could not say that culture was important for stratification. People would be stratified by their income or their power; and whatever deference they received or had to give, whatever boundaries were drawn between them and people who would not deign to associate with them (those ranking above them) and people whom they did not care to associate with (those ranking below) would be based on money or power, not on anything to do with their culture. Weber saw that this was not so: that in addition to the stratification produced by class and power, there were numerous possible hierarchies in the realm of culture. Historically, the most important of these cultural hierarchies have been based on religion. There is a definite stratification within every religion: At minimum there is a difference in status between believers and nonbelievers. The former consider</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves more virtuous and enlightened than the latter, regardless of their respective wealth and power, and such cultural strata are just as likely to associate together and exclude outsiders as are economic classes and power groups. Most religions have much more than this minimum stratification. There are hierarchies from popes, gurus, and high priests on down through minor ceremonial assistants, devoted worshipers, merely formal members, and intermittent sinners. Admittedly, this is not necessarily an exclusive basis of stratification; churches often have property interests and political connections, and clergy may associate socially with correspondingly wealthy or powerful laypeople. Cultural stratification is important especially because it is closest to the way most people actually view their worlds. We feel that we associate with certain people and not with others, not usually because we see ourselves as economic or political allies, but because we like and respect certain people and not others. If we analyze that liking we find that it usually involves cultural stratification. Respectable churchgoing people in general prefer others like themselves, not hard-drinking denizens of bars and pool halls; hostesses who practice gracious etiquette and converse about the arts do not invite the backyard barbecue set. It is here that Weber's philosophical background plays a key role in his sociology. In his introductory methodological writings, Weber emphasized that the proper subject of sociology is meaningful human actions. It is not a meaningful social action when all people put up their umbrellas at the same time, if they are simply reacting to an external stimulus—rain. Rather, what sociologists are concerned with are actions that people understand as having social significance. Work is significant because people understand it as a path to social success, or as too degrading for the gentry, or as an assurance of salvation in the afterlife. Leisure, too, is a field of meanings: One lives in a noble style of display and consumption, or one eschews the external world for the sake of one's ascetical enlightenment, or one competes with one's neighbors to show one's respectability. There are many such possibilities, and these make up the field of cultural stratification. They were so important in Weber's overall model of society that he continually emphasized the subjective side of life. For Weber, sociological analysis had to always involve verstehen—an empathic understanding of what people's subjective meanings are. Whether we deal with our contemporaries or with people in the past, we must always make the effort to put ourselves emotionally and intellectually in their places. Only thus do we understand the struggles involved in stratification and the rest of human social life. Cultural stratification is thus the most complex and subtlest of all the forms of stratification. There are relatively few distinct political and economic groups in any society, but the varieties and ramifications of cultural hierarchies can be enormously refined, especially in a modern industrial society. Indeed, cultural stratification can subdivide the lines of status distinction to such a degree that virtually every group or individual may have a status of its own. In addition to religion, cultural hierarchies can be based</p>
<p class="calibre1">on secularized religious ideals like honesty, hard work, ambition, and self- control (Weber's Protestant ethic); on achievement or understanding in science, literature, music, and art; on good manners, tastes in decoration and clothes; or even prominence in sports. Cultural stratification may be formally recognized in a society, as in the Hindu caste system based on ritual acts that keep members of the "higher" religions from coming into close contact with those who once belonged to "lower" religions. The ranks of European aristocracy, with their elaborate etiquette and code of honor, illustrate a similar development on a nonreligious basis. Cultural hierarchies are the substance of the world as most people experience it, but their significance comes from the ways in which they are connected with the rest of the social order—with economics and politics and their corresponding forms of stratification. This connection can operate in two ways. First, cultural stratification can be the basis for economic and political stratification. The New England colonies are one of the best examples of this. The church leaders were also the political authorities, and only members in good standing of the church congregation—a minority of the people—could participate in governing the community. Moreover, the religious upper class took the lead in organizing commerce, farming, and fishing and thus became an economic upper class. The religious, political, and economic hierarchies began to separate in the eighteenth century, but even today Americans (especially middle-class, white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants) tend to judge people's status according to their "respectability" in religious terms—essentially, according to how well they live up to the vestigial norms of the Protestant ethic. Second, economic and political stratification tend to turn into cultural stratification. The cold realities of wealth and power are too blatant for most people, no matter what their status. There is a widespread need to feel that those on the top merit their good fortune; thus people who rise in wealth or power attempt to cloak themselves in cultural respectability. The conquering tribesmen of antiquity called on priests to sanction their conquests, just as Charlemagne had himself crowned by the pope after building a kingdom by war. Later, the way to the top is forgotten; the aristocracy claims that it rales not by force but by hereditary right and by the merits expressed in its code of honor and its patronage of the arts. Just such a mutation has occurred between the robber barons of nineteenth-century finance and the high society of today. Economic, political, and cultural goods can be traded off for each other, and Weber postulates a tendency for the three hierarchies to come together in times of social tranquillity. The wealthy try to become powerful and cultured; the powerful use their influence to become rich and surrounded with high culture; cultural elites try to use their prestige to acquire wealth and power. But changes and competition within the realms of economics, politics, and culture periodically upset the composition of classes, power groups, and status groups, and we find the three hierarchies consolidating, breaking down, and rearranging again and again. History is a continuous</p>
<p class="calibre1">battle, not only of knights against officials, bureaucrats against politicians, landowners against financiers, industrialists against unionists, and priests against scientists and intellectuals, but of each of these orders against the others. The processes of stratification not only make up the fabric of our everyday lives, but as we shall see shortly, they turn the engines of history as Weber saw it. Organizations: Patrimonialism and Bureaucracy Surveying world social forms, Weber noted that there are two general ways in which people can stabilize their relationships: either by establishing strong personal ties or by setting up general rules. These were ideal types, of course. Reality is always a mixture of them, although the organizations of traditional societies have usually fallen near the personalistic pole, and modern organizations near the abstract rules pole. Weber often speaks of the former type of organization as patriarchal or patrimonial and of the latter as bureaucratic. The distinction follows broadly from that which Weber's older colleague Ferdinand Toennies made between Gemeinschaft (community) and Gesellschaft (society). Personalistic organizations usually begin with the family household. We find the lord in ancient China or Assyria, or the citizen in Athens or Rome, or the baron in medieval Europe running his estate and his politics like a great family enterprise. Sons and brothers are his most trusted assistants, whether in supervising farming or trading expeditions, fighting a war, or collecting taxes for a higher authority. Servants and slaves are like part of the family, subject to the same loyalties and jealousies and to the same patriarchal whims. No distinction is made between public and private, between the official finances and the domestic purse. The king collects taxes equally for his troops and for his wine cellar, and his subaltern lord pays his own expenses and profits out of what he can collect before passing it on up. This form of organization can be extended across large numbers of people by linking together chains of masters and followers. In a patrimonial regime the king has trusted lieutenants who administer distant sections of his realm; they in turn assign their trusted followers to various areas and tasks; and so on down to the lowest official, whose job it is to coerce the peasants to give up their produce. Premodern trading companies and factories were organized in the same way, but on a much smaller scale. The main disadvantages of the personalistic form of organization are that it is neither very efficient nor very easy to control. Lines of communication from top to bottom are virtually nonexistent, and orders from above are likely to emerge as rumors below, if indeed they are passed on at all. How tasks are carried out depends almost entirely on the energy and initiative of the individuals involved. Under the circumstances such organizations tend to fall back on tradition—to do a job as it was done last time and as far back as anyone can remember, since there are no other guidelines and it may not be safe to do anything that a vengeful superior could criticize. At</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same time, such organizations continually slip from the control of their founders. Again and again in history a lord conquers a large territory and appoints his most trusted followers to collect the spoils, and they in turn appoint their assistants. By the time the conqueror dies, and sometimes before, the central authority begins to dissipate. Only a small portion of the taxes or booty collected comes through to the king. Eventually the more powerful lords may make themselves totally independent. Sometimes the process continues until the jurisdictions are fragmented down to the lowest level (as happened in medieval Germany); sometimes it is arrested halfway in a feudal compromise splitting authority among the levels; sometimes it is reversed by another conquest. These political disadvantages provided the impetus for developing the other main type of organization: bureaucracy. Kings and lords long ago found that they could arrest the dissipation of authority not merely by setting servants to spy on each other (which tended to make an organization secretive and clique-ridden) but by laying down general rules. Instead of leaving procedures to the discretion of subordinates, the ruler himself could control matters from afar by selecting, training, and checking up on persons whose only job was to follow the rules. Instead of having general authority over a territory, an official could be confined to one specialized kind of job; power was thus split up and controlled from above. If abuses came from the lack of distinction between personal property and the king's property, a rigid line between public and private could be drawn. Instead of tasks being performed intermittently by local barons, they could be handled by officials recruited for full-time careers and paid specified salaries. Weber found elements of this type of organization in cultures as far back as ancient Egypt and China, but its main development occurred only in Europe as the absolutist monarchies emerged on a bureaucratic basis, ending the period of medieval feudalism. Trie first great bureaucracies (after the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages) were developed in France, Prussia, and Russia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the nineteenth century the form was widely imitated, not only by governments but by industrial enterprises that needed an efficient form of control over a large and complex division of labor. Since then bureaucratization has spread to all forms of social life—so much so that Weber regarded it as one of the main currents in modern history. Considering its advantages, why did full-blown bureaucracy develop so late? Weber pointed out certain social and material prerequisites. The development of writing and then of a large group of literate officials was necessary for an organization carrying out specialized rules and keeping records of its activities. A money economy was needed if officials were to be paid in salaries instead of in land or booty. Improved transportation and communication (roads, navigable rivers and canals, a courier system) were necessary if a king was to keep track of what his officials were doing in distant realms. Changing material conditions aided the development of centralized administration. Firearms made the self-equipped knight obsolete</p>
<p class="calibre1">and aided the rise of the large, bureaucratic army of foot soldiers. Similarly, the invention of industrial machinery helped replace scattered handicraft production with the bureaucratic factory. But the bureaucratic form itself is historically primary; without its development through the struggles of politics, modern industrial innovations could never have been used and hence would never have been invented. Moreover, bureaucracy is hardly Utopian. The kings who created it in order to control their errant knights soon found that their new machinery was slipping from their hands. Once established, the bureaucracy could do its work of administering regulations without a ruler and could even make up new rules as the occasion provided. Indeed, rulers soon began to get in the way of its smooth functioning, and hereditary monarchs grew progressively weaker until they fell in revolutions or degenerated into figureheads. Nor is bureaucracy the epitome of efficiency. Cabinet ministers and industrialists often have little more control over it than do kings. Weber saw in the world around him all the phenomena that have become famous under the labels "red tape" and "Parkinson's Law": the tendency for officials to see rules as ends in themselves rather than as means to ends; the difficulty of finding responsible decision makers amid a maze of rules and regulations, the tendency for organizations to drift, to expand mindlessly, to make their own survival the highest value. Many of these themes have been explored in subsequent research by such sociologists as Philip Selznick, Peter Blau, and Michel Crozier. Always a political man, Weber discovered organizational politics even in the supposedly neutral instrument of bureaucracy. As was noted with regard to his theory of stratification, Weber saw how individuals' views and interests develop from the positions they hold, and he saw how rules and regulations could be used in the continual jockeying for authority and autonomy that human beings carry on. What American sociologists have since come to think of as "informal organization" within "formal organization," Weber saw as part of the implicit dialectic of the struggle for control. Personalistic and bureaucratic forms of organization, after all, are ideal types, and reality is always a mixture. As the Weberian scholar Guenther Roth has pointed out, the clever administrator uses both strategies of control—a mixture of personal loyalties and bureaucratic impartiality and the use of special emissaries with diffuse authority to carry out tasks that the rules and regulations impede. Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy were masters of the technique of mixed strategies. Both methods have their drawbacks, but only by tireless juggling between them can an organizational leader actually lead. Politics: Traditional, Charismatic, and Rational-Legal Legitimacy Politics is conflict over who shall control the state, the apparatus of coercion in a society. To call the state an apparatus of coercion means only that its ultimate appeal to force is the one thing that all states have in common; it</p>
<p class="calibre1">does not mean that all states necessarily coerce most of their members most of the time. A democracy is a type of state in which power is split up among contending parties and separate jurisdictions, so that in fact the state does relatively little coercing. That perhaps is an ideal, and Weber would agree with Hegel's verdict that "history is the chopping-block at which the happiness of peoples, the wisdom of states, and the virtue of individuals have been victimized." Politics is made up of three components: the groups contending for power, the organizations through which power is sought and exercised, and the ideas and ideals that legitimate authority. We have already considered the first two: The contending groups are found in the stratification of a society and may consist of economic classes, existing power groups, or status groups—each interested in manipulating the state to further its ends. We can have various kinds of political movements: those interested in economic policies and the state protection or control of property; those interested in power for its own sake or in extending the power of an organization (whether it be a party, welfare bureaucracy, army, police force, or court system); and those interested in having the state sanction some particular culture with official status (those interested in or opposed to school prayers, abortion, the prohibition of alcohol, explicit sex in movies, psychedelics, and so forth). We have also seen the various kinds of political organizations that have existed and noted some of their preconditions and dynamics. There remains the dynamics of legitimacy. Weber saw that people have material and power interests, but that they also see the world in terms of ideas and ideals. Individuals will fight and die for worldviews as well as for money and power. The difference between Weber's view and the naive conservative view that sees the state as a spiritual unity is that Weber realized that people's ideals differ within the same society. As Weber put it, people have both material and ideal interests, and their interests often conflict. As Weber noted, a society cannot be held together by force alone. Obviously, an army can control an unarmed populace. But within the army the general is not necessarily the strongest man, and he may not even carry a gun. Why then are other men afraid to disobey him? Because if one man disobeys and the others obey, the single dissenter will be shot. Why don't all the men disobey together? Because if they want to act together, they must have some sort of organization, and that again raises the question of who shall lead and how his authority will be enforced. To the old philosophical question "Who shall guard the guardians?" Weber replied that organizations can be based on force provided widespread beliefs about legitimacy exist. The general's orders are obeyed because each man expects others to obey him, and this expectation is based on the widespread belief that the general has legitimate authority. Weber was well enough acquainted with history and with the daily newspapers to know that orders are not always obeyed, that the legitimacy of a leader or regime can rise and fall. Accordingly, he was interested in the dynamics of legitimacy. Out of his historical perspective, Weber produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">three ideal types of legitimacy. First, authority could be based on tradition: A king rules because his family has always ruled (so he says), because he is chosen by the gods, or because the tribal council selected him through traditional ceremonial methods. Second, authority could be based on personal charisma: "It is written .... but I say unto you . . . ," proclaims the prophet, the hero, the dominant personality, discarding tradition in favor of his own revelations. Third, authority could be rational-legal: The laws provide the procedure for selecting legitimate presidents and chancellors; bureaucratic regulations delegate authority to the police and the passport clerks. Each of these forms of legitimacy has a corresponding form of organization. Traditional rulers are found primarily in patrimonial and patriarchal organizations; charismatic leaders usually have a personal retinue of disciples and a large unorganized following; rational-legal officials are found in bureaucracies. Each form of legitimacy has its advantages and drawbacks. Traditional leaders seem to have little to worry about. Tradition says they are kings or chiefs, and there is nothing anyone can do about it (except of course their enemies in other kingdoms and tribes). Still, Weber points out that political struggle is never entirely absent, although it may be underground. Traditional rulers are often limited by the very tradition. Their advisers, noblemen, and priests are seldom idle about interpreting tradition to their advantage and against the powers of the ruler. If they want to do things their way, they must continually struggle to interpret traditions to their advantage. But there are dangers in success, too; if they extend their power too far beyond tradition, they may lose their traditional legitimacy. Ancient history (and modern, too) is full of kings turned tyrants who were overthrown and replaced by one of the noblemen waiting in the wings. One possibility for the ambitious traditional monarch is to mix traditional authority with personal charisma. But this has its difficulties and dangers too. First, in order to be charismatic, one must have some extraordinary personal qualities. To be sure, these can often be evoked by stagecraft and public relations, but the charismatic leader has entered an arena in which the pressure is on, and he or she must live up to the billing or disappear into that special obscurity reserved for has-been charismatics. Every emergency—famine, riot, invasion, or special omen—calls for a corresponding miracle. If the charismatic leader does not live up to his or her own reputation, he or she soon loses legitimacy to a rival charismatic or to an "I-told- you-so" traditionalist. The tides of legitimacy can ebb and flow with startling rapidity, as the history of modern coups d'etat demonstrates. Finally, authority can be rational-legal. But rationalization is another dangerous beast to ride. Once this force is unleashed, there is no individual who cannot be found dispensable. The European monarchs who tried to consolidate their traditional authority by building a purely legal state found in the end that there is no justification for kings in a rational-legal code. The descendants of Louis XIV and Frederick the Great paid for the power they built. Rationalization attempts to remove the arbitrary, to provide a clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sufficient reason for every social act. Not only kings, but party leaders, prime ministers, dictators, and individual bureaucrats themselves can be found wanting by the standards of the rational-legal regimes they control. Every regime that proclaims its principles—whether in the ideals of socialism, the United States Constitution, or the Declaration of the Rights of Man—is subject to the judgment of its people. Of course, regimes can get away with considerable deviations from their avowed ideals, since they control powerful organizational and material resources, including the communication facilities, which can define much of the reality its people observe. Still, ideals create a rallying point for potential opponents (like the dissident writers in the Soviet Union or the antiracist and antimilitarist movements in the United States) and constitute the weak link in the authority structure of a regime weakened by defeat, economic crisis, or internal conflict among its power holders. The traditional ruler, at any rate, did not have to spend much effort in justifying his or her actions. Thus, even where they are not lived up to (that is, almost everywhere), rational-legal principles of legitimacy set the basic context in which political dispute goes on. WEBER'S THEORY OF HISTORY: THE RATIONALIZATION OF THE WORLD The great transformation in history was that unmistakable phenomenon called "modernization," which turned a world of peasants, lords, and priests into a buzzing hive of organization, machinery, and movement. Weber found the core of that change in the new industrial economy. An explanation of the emergence of modern capitalism would thus be an explanation of modernity, and Weber's search for its roots led him to describe the social outlines of world history. Weber began by analyzing the modern economic system. The key attribute is predictability. There is no point in manufacturing large amounts of goods unless you can be sure of a regular market for them, and you cannot get the benefits of modern machinery and specialized division of labor unless you can continuously produce large amounts. Moreover, you cannot run a factory unless you can depend on having a regular supply of workers to hire and unless you can borrow money for capital expenses when you need it, and under fair and reasonable conditions. In short, modern industry depends on large and stable markets, a dependable and economically motivated labor force, and a trustworthy financial system. Weber saw that these preconditions were missing throughout most of history and that a long chain of prerequisites had somehow to emerge before the modern economy could take off. Markets, for example, had been mostly local—peasants producing their own necessities and bartering or selling the rest in nearby towns. Of the many factors that limited larger markets, three important ones were: (1) the riskiness of transporting valuable goods in a world of continuous warfare</p>
<p class="calibre1">and conquest, where robbers and barons were equally dangerous and civil order existed only within the walls of one's town or sometimes only in one's house; (2) the general lack of a widespread system of money and credit to facilitate large-scale trading; and (3) distrust of strangers—from other lands, other religions, other villages—which made trading a matter of crafty haggling and merchants often indistinguishable from pirates. Labor, in the modern sense, was also a historical rarity. Industries cannot run efficiently and competitively if workers are not available who will move from job to job as demand for products changes and who can be attracted to the areas of greatest profit by offers of commensurate wages. (As we see, Weber's economics is in the classical English tradition.) But workers in traditional societies are for the most part not free economic agents. Peasants are often bound to the land as serfs; industrial laborers are usually family members, household servants, or slaves, bound to the enterprise, and a continuing expense whether they are overworked or underworked. Guild monopolies control most of the remaining labor supply. All these various obstacles had to be broken down before the industrial labor force could be brought together in the factory system. Finally, modern finance is also a recent development. Only in the large kingdoms and empires did a widespread system of money exist at all. Even then, there were many obstacles to a dependable system of loans. Widespread literacy was necessary before the more complex forms of credit—such as the stock market—could arise. Money was lent only at exorbitant rates of interest as long as the risks of nonpayment and failure were great—as they were in an era when courts and police did not exist to back up contracts and when every business enterprise was risky. Not the least of the danger came from the state itself. Taxes were capricious and often little more than robbery; if a banker lent money to a king, there was no guarantee that he would ever get it back. Thus several great German banking houses—including the famous Fuggers of Augsburg—were wiped out in bankruptcies of the kings of Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In such a world the life of a businessman was a precarious one. If by chance he was successful and amassed a fortune, he did not reinvest it in expanding his business, but made every effort to buy himself some land and a title of nobility and thus get out of the business world entirely. Weber's task was to trace back through history to find out where and how each of these obstacles fell—to determine the one time and place where all the circumstances were right and where the industrial takeoff could begin. The story begins in remote antiquity in a world of tribal societies—some agricultural, some made up of nomadic herdsmen and hunters. Religion played a key role in their social structure and in their worldviews. People lived and worked almost entirely with their kinspeople, and the kinship network and the community were united by a common set of ceremonies surrounding all aspects of life. Gods and spirits were everywhere— in the sky and the trees, guarding the hearth and the door of the house, and legitimating the authority of the patriarch-priest-chief. Like Durkheim, Weber recognized the integrating force of religion in primitive society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Change came about especially by political struggle. Hunting tribes conquered agricultural tribes, creating two-class societies of peasants and warrior-aristocrats. Conquests went wider and wider; empires rose and fell; kings emerged; complex stratification grew within the ranks of the aristocracy; and ro)ral administration (primitive bureaucracies) came into being. The familiar pendulum swings of world political history began: Overextended patrimonial regimes disintegrated into feudalism and then reconsol- idated under a new conqueror. In these larger, more complex societies, wealth became concentrated. A division of labor developed around the royal courts, as artisans, servants, scribes, and merchants specialized to satisfy royal tastes. Priests developed separate hierarchies of their own, amalgamating war gods and nature gods into new syncretisms and pantheons. In a number of these large societies—notably China and India—and in independent cities and small states on their peripheries—notably in Greece and Israel—a great change took place in the realm of religion between the sixth and fourth centuries B.C. Talcott Parsons, a leading interpreter of this phase of Weber's work, calls this change the "philosophical breakthrough": the rise of the great world religions. In each of these—Confucianism, Brahminism, Buddhism, Greek ethical philosophy, monotheistic Judaism and its later offshoots, Christianity and Islam—the nature of humankind's relationship to the physical and social worlds changes. The change consists of separating the idea of the natural world from the idea of the spiritual world. Instead of gods and spirits routinely intervening in the world around us (as in Greek mythology), there exists another, very different realm: heaven and hell, another sphere of reality, a world of ideal principles. The consequences of this change were far-reaching. As long as the world is in the play of gods and spirits, it cannot be taken as a very predictable place. One can only try to placate its invisible rulers by ceremonies and sacrifices or to control them by magic. But once the spiritual realm becomes separate, both nature and society can be treated in a stabler way. First, by removing animistic entities the world becomes open to rational explanation. The door is opened to scientific investigation and explanation. This new-found rationalism can spill over into the social realm as well. People can think of laws based on consistent general principles, instead of bowing before the eccentricities of sanctified tradition. Political and social arrangements, too, become subject to a rational critique—although this latter implication was not really seized upon until the French Enlightenment of the eighteenth century. Second, religion itself can develop in new directions. Primitive religions merely describe an accepted if invisible side of the ordinary world. One placates the gods in order to kill one's enemies and make one's crops grow; one does not worry about being good or going to heaven. (Think of the heroes of the Odyssey or the early part of the Old Testament.) The philosophical breakthrough opens up two new possibilities: (1) The spiritual realm can now be a place to which one escapes from the trials and tribulations of the world. If the righteous individual—the one who follows all the rituals and does all his or her duties—nevertheless has bad fortune in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world, it does not fundamentally concern that person. In fact, the material world can now be seen as a dangerous temptation, for the truly holy person concentrates only on salvation. (2) The ideas of good and evil can develop separately from the ideas of worldly success and failure. For the primitive person sin simply means misfortune; as long as one is prosperous, healthy, and powerful, one has a clear conscience. The philosophical breakthrough puts a new ethical obligation on human beings. They are now to be concerned with justice and injustice toward their fellow human beings; conscience becomes its own reward and punishment. These new possibilities, especially the second, are potential forces for great changes in society. The new ideas of good and evil and the concept of a world of perfection can provide tremendous leverage for changing the world to make it live up to these ideals. Here in antiquity we find the basis of Weber's Protestant ethic, which was to play a powerful role in the takeoff of industrialization 2,000 years later. There is one more crucial attribute of the religions of the philosophical breakthrough: They are all universalistic. Earlier religions are limited to the members of one family, one tribe, or one ethnic group. The world religions, emerging in or near empires with unlimited ambitions of conquest, exclude no one. Indeed, earlier religions are tolerant; they conceive of a pluralistic world of many peoples, each with their patron gods. But for Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and so on there is only one god or spiritual reality; all else is false, illusory, or subordinate. This shift is crucial because religions mark the limits of solidarity in society. In primitive and traditional societies, people are bound together with those who share a religious community. One can and must trust people who worship the same household or tribal gods. But strangers—people with different gods—are alien beings who cannot be trusted. One result of this setup was a widespread prohibition on usury—lending money at interest to other members of one's own religious group. Outside the group one could bargain in as cutthroat a fashion as possible, since there were no ethical obligations toward outsiders. Thus, to universalize a religion was abruptly to broaden the community within which peaceful social transactions could regularly be carried out. The philosophical breakthrough opened many of the doors to industrialization: laying the basis for a moral community of trust underlying peaceful commerce; rationalizing the legal system; motivating people to remake political, social, and economic institutions in keeping with an imperative to transform the world more closely to the ideal. But these implications took a long time to work themselves out, and not all the world religions opened up just the right path to the transformation of society. Weber's first major writing, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, is on this subject. It selects for careful study only one thread in the complex tapestry that was rising capitalism—the role that religious beliefs played in motivating the businessmen who developed capitalism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Weber points out that the attitude of the modern capitalist is not simply the drive for economic gain; this ac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">quisitiveness is found everywhere in world history without resulting in a mass-production economy. What is significant for a large-scale, profit-making system, rather, is the methodical attitude: the making of a continual series of small savings and small profits that gradually add up to a long-term, mass-production economy and, ultimately, to far greater profits than the greedy, one-shot businessperson could ever attain. Weber saw this methodical, "rationalized" attitude emerging first in another sphere—the religious ideas of the most radical Protestants soon after the Reformation. These were especially the followers of Calvin, who were prominent in the most commercialized areas of the Netherlands, France, Germany, and, above all, England and America. They no longer believed in salvation by prayers, charity, or religious rituals; they believed that God was an omnipotent, inexorable power, who had already picked out those who were to be saved and those who were damned. The psychological effect of this doctrine of predestination, Weber declared, must have been to put a tremendous strain on the believers. Was one saved or not? One could do nothing specifically religious to help oneself; priests and monks were no better than anyone else (and quite possibly worse, since they could do no honest work); hence these radical Protestants eliminated monasteries and tried to make priests as much like lay persons as possible. What one could do, though, was to work—hard, methodologically, without coveting gains but continually pressing on, until by one's own success one felt that one did fit into God's scheme of predestination, and that one was one of the elect. In this way, the religious beliefs of radical Protestants helped produce just the attitudes that made successful capitalists and thus fostered the industrial revolution. This theory, known as "the Weber thesis," has been argued pro and con ever since it first came out in 1904. Unfortunately, it has become so famous that many scholars have attempted to refute it (or support it) without knowledge of Weber's later work on the other world religions, or of his general sociology, in which he ties religious ideas to organizational forms, status groups, and political struggles. Weber's theory of capitalism has been interpreted narrowly as an argument that ideas determine social change. Probably the reason it has been so popular is that it apparently refutes Marx, showing that religion is the cause of material conditions instead of vice versa. This position has been especially fostered in the United States by Talcott Parsons, who translated The Protestant Ethic in 1930, which was years ahead of translations of any of Weber's other major works. Now, however, we have a wider picture of what Weber actually discovered. The study of radical Protestant beliefs was just a preliminary analysis of recent Western religious history; later he would develop a massive world comparison of all the great religions and their social effects. Weber completed The Religion of China, The Religion of India, and Ancient Judaism; he died before he could begin his studies of Islam and early Christianity. His broad conclusion was that only a certain kind of breakthrough—the mixture of the ethical and scientific rationalism of Greek philosophy with the Judaic- derived legalism and world-changing activism that went to make up</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity—gave the impetus for rationalizing social institutions and changing the world in the economic and political upheavals of modernity. Confucianism, Brahminism, Buddhism, and Islam he found entwined with the patrimonial order of stratification in such ways that they strengthened the unpredictable, irrational aspects of their societies rather than weakened them. In Europe the key story concerns the growth of the Christian Church— the first large-scale truly rationalized bureaucratic organization in history— and its growing consolidation with the remnants of the Roman Empire, itself legally rationalized under the influence of Greek culture. The age-old pendulum of political consolidation and disintegration swung on, but was nearing the end of its monotonous cycle through time. By the sixteenth century kings began to build the bureaucracies—using priests as their first bureaucrats—that would eventually destroy the fragmented and conflict- ridden feudal system, establish a predictable set of laws and a trustworthy monetary system, bring peace and order to large expanses of territory, and carry out regular tax policies. Commerce spread; mechanical inventions were sought and made; and handicraft industries developed. Western Europe perched on the brink of industrialization, held back only by government mercantilist policies of establishing monopolies and by the feudal bondage of labor to the soil. The final obstacles fell in England—ironically, the Western European country in which the feudal gentry had fought the most successful battle against the king and in which royal absolutism was least far advanced. After the civil war of the seventeenth century the small gentry class gained control of the state bureaucracy and used it to further their economic interests—moving the peasants off the land, thereby creating a labor force for the textile mills, and establishing an economic policy that would remove restraints on competition. The battle was fought and won by radical Protestants: men who felt that work, honesty, and rule following were the commandments of God and who were further impelled by a powerful vision of the ideal world of heaven and hell. Their emergence at this propitious time in history is not yet understood, but the tradition from which they emerged is clear: They revived the early spirit of Christianity and brought to fruition the world-transforming potential of the religious breakthroughs of antiquity. Once the industrial revolution was in full swing, its progress was unim- pedible. New social classes appeared, transforming politics from the exclusive province of military aristocrats and court cabals to an object of mass movements and bureaucratic manipulations. Science, education, and mass communications were unleashed, to transform again and again the nature of stratification and of industry. England rose to wealth and world power. The rulers of other nations, however fearful of modernization's destructive effect on the old order that supported them, were forced to emulate England in order to keep pace militarily; otherwise, they faced the risk of becoming colonies of the modernized states.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From his towering intellectual vantage point, Weber watched the panorama of events flow through the centuries. Die Entzauberung der Welt, he called it—the disenchantment of the world, the master trend of history. Rationalization steadily pushes back the uncertain, the mythical, the poetic. Once all the world was seen through a veil of ritual and ceremony, goddesses and fire-breathing dragons, and the thousand fearful chances of everyday life; now daily railroad trains bring tourists to the castles of Transylvania. Even the God-fearing Protestant entrepreneur has disappeared, replaced by the bureaucratic employee. Since the modern system is established, it runs of its own accord. But the Protestant ethic is not dead, it is merely secularized. Its spirit hangs on in the very institutions of modern society and in the tightly controlled personalities of people who work in a world of rules and regulations, merit ratings, and bureaucratic security. In an America split in cultural war between a white middle-class generation still deep in the Protestant ethic and that generation's own sons and daughters, who have rejected the "uptight" world in alliance with the members of a black culture that escaped such a world only by being kept at the bottom, Weber's sociology strikes the central theme. No one saw more clearly than Weber the ways in which our lives are "haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs." For all his voluminous writings Weber was first and foremost a political man. From his early career he was active in the law courts and government agencies of Berlin. His interest in economics was first stimulated when reform groups commissioned him to study the problems of labor immigration in East Prussia and stock-market manipulations. He began with his father's upper-class imperialist loyalties, but increasing exposure to the hardships of the lower classes shifted his sympathies gradually to the left. Nevertheless, he had no illusions about the costs of reform. He regarded the Socialist utopia as an ideology with which the leaders of the Social Democratic party kept their followers in line, and he was in accord with his young friend Robert Michels' analysis of the "Iron Law of Oligarchy" in party politics. The Marxists' flaw was that they failed to see the bureaucratic nature of the modern economy, whether it be capitalist or Socialist. Weber became interested in Russia during the abortive revolution of 1905 and learned Russian in order to follow the events firsthand. His analysis was a remarkable foresight into the Soviet period. Should Russia lose a major European war and the revolutionary left come to power, he predicted, Russia would experience a bureaucratization of the entire social structure such as the world had never seen. Considering Weber's views on the quality of life in a bureaucracy, his expectations were anything but optimistic. "The dictatorship of the official and not of the proletariat is on the march," he wrote. The situation in Germany was scarcely more hopeful. Weber's growing disillusionment with conservative nationalism came as he watched Germany's inept foreign policy, losing allies and progressively isolating it-</p>
<p class="calibre1">self while at the same time carrying on an arms race and an increasingly strident campaign of nationalist self-glorification. He placed the blame on Germany's political structure: an impotent parliament incapable of controlling an irresponsible state bureaucracy; an army staffed by the defensively arrogant aristocrats of a bygone era; and a foolish hereditary monarch initiating policies that trapped the rest of the nation in their wake. In the 1890s Weber took part in efforts to create a responsible democratic party, but he dropped out when its hopelessness became apparent. When World War I finally broke out, the release from years of tension came as a relief. Weber was at first enthusiastic. "In spite of all," he declared it "a great and wonderful war." As a fifty-year-old reserve officer in the German army, he was called to duty as the director of military hospitals in the Heidelberg area. A year later he retired and went to Berlin to wield what political influence he could to end the war. After his first enthusiasm had worn off, Weber quickly realized that Germany's military and political leadership was incapable of carrying out a victorious policy and that a prolongation of the war could only result in the destruction of German—indeed, of European—power and the turning over of world domination to America. By 1918 his last loyalties to the Kaiser were gone, and he published a series of newspaper articles calling for a democratic constitution for postwar Germany. The fall of the old regime seemed to take a personal weight from Weber's shoulders. From the Versailles peace conference, where he served on the German delegation, he wrote that he slept soundly at night for the first time in many years. Even his inability to teach was overcome. He accepted a professorship at Munich, where he lectured to enormous crowds of students, intellectuals, and public dignitaries. Politics suddenly showed opportunities. Weber became the leader of a new, liberal, democratic party. An archrealist, he nevertheless saw a ray of hope. Political parties might be corrupt oligarchies, but only within free parliamentary competition might leaders arise capable of controlling the recalcitrant state bureaucracy and giving the nation intelligent policies. But time had run out. In 1919 Weber fell ill of pneumonia, and he died the next year at the age of fifty-six. His party collapsed; the first of the German republic's many economic and political crises was upon it. Responsible leadership would not be forthcoming; the irresponsible leaders were already gathering in the beer gardens of Munich. Politics is a dangerous and morally taxing vocation, Weber had told his students in one of his famous last lectures. The idealist as well as the cynic is caught in webs of consequences far beyond those intended in his or her acts. Ideals alone are not enough; they must be accompanied by hard realism, sympathetic imagination, and an unyielding sense of responsibility. The following might have been his own epitaph for his accomplishments in the realm of knowledge as well as his failures in the realm of politics: Politics is a strong and slow boring of hard boards. It takes both passion and perspective. Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth—that man</p>
<p class="calibre1">would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible. But to do that a man must be a leader, and not only a leader but a hero as well, in a very sober sense of the word. And even those who are neither leaders nor heroes must arm themselves with that steadfastness of heart which can brave even the crumbling of all hopes. This is necessary right now, or else men will not be able to attain even that which is possible today. Only he has the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid or too base for what he wants to offer. Only he who in the face of all this can say "In spite of all!" has the calling for politics.1 'Max Weber, "Politics as a Vocation," in H. H. Gerth and C.

<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER EIGHT Sigmund Freud: Conquistador of the Irrational The cataclysmic twentieth-century wars had yet to burst upon the face of humankind; Darwin's Origin of Species was three years away from publication, and Einstein's birth lay twenty-three years in the future, when Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was born in Freiburg, Moravia. Western civilization was intact. Europe enjoyed an uneasy peace, while America was on the verge of civil war. In modern times Freud has become a legendary figure in the history of science. He is remembered as the founder of psychoanalysis, a method for understanding human motivation and a technique for healing the psyche. He presented himself in his autobiography as a scientist; yet he opened a crack in the scientific edifice of Reason, which had dominated the intellectual scene since the Enlightenment. The social philosophers of that period, including Montesquieu, Diderot, d'Alembert, Rousseau, Condorcet, and Turgot, subscribed wholeheartedly to the Aristotelian dictum that humankind is composed of rational animals. The philosophers' vision, which the founding fathers of sociology attempted to put into practice, was of free rational humans emerging from centuries of ignorance, fear, and superstition into a bright new dawn of Reason, science, and unlimited progress. Humankind, the moving force of society, was to be guided by rational knowledge in a conscious attempt to remake the world in its own image and thereby shape its planetary destiny. Freud's greatest discovery was the systematic unearthing of the vast and hidden continent of the human unconscious. Via the method of psychoanalysis he probed the depths of the psyche and uncovered the irrational side of human nature. It is one of the paradoxes of Freud's life that the work of this eminent scientist and man of reason should have heralded the end of the Age of Reason. The Enlightenment dream of the eighteenth-century philosophes died in Freud, a child of that Enlightenment. No longer could the Western individual trust solely and naively in Reason to solve the problems of collective living. Freud showed that the individual is basically 140</p>
<p class="calibre1">a nonrational being, driven by such emotional forces as "sexual instincts" and "repressed wishes." Although Freud did not discover the unconscious, he was the first to give content to what had previously been an unfilled form. The idea of the unconscious had been brewing in the German intellectual climate since the publication of Eduard von Hartmann's The Philosophy of the Unconscious in 1859. But the metaphysician von Hartmann did not claim to have explored the region of the unconscious; rather, he arrived there by a process of abstract reasoning and found "will" and "intellect" (parallel to Freud's formulations of "id" and "ego") in a state of conflict. Nor was the nineteenth century the first age in the history of Western thought to have conceived this idea; it may be traced back to antiquity. The idea of an unconscious in humankind lurked in Plato's parable of the cave more than two millennia prior to Freud. EARLY LIFE AND WORK As a child, Freud was the center of attention in his Viennese family's household. He was so much his mother's favorite that she discontinued his younger sister's piano lessons because the ten-year-old Sigmund complained that the noise disturbed his studies. Freud was a child prodigy who began reading Shakespeare at age eight and was later fascinated by Thiers' Consulate and Empire. A hero-worshiper during adolescence, he dreamed of becoming a great general. He was so taken with the romance of Napoleon that he pasted onto the backs of his toy wooden soldiers little labels bearing the names of the French emperor's marshals. Freud graduated summa cum laude from high school. During the last six of his eight years at Sperl Gymnasium he ranked number one in his class and occupied such a privileged position that he was hardly ever questioned in class. His choice of profession was determined to a great extent by his social position as a Viennese Jew. The alternatives open to him were those of industry, business, law, and medicine. His intellectual bent eliminated the first two, and he considered taking up the study of jurisprudence. However, although he felt no direct attraction to medicine, he was motivated by the sort of curiosity that is directed more toward human concerns than toward natural objects. It was a period of indecision. On the one hand, he was influenced to study law by a school friend who was later to become a famous politician; on the other hand, he was attracted by the then topical evolutionary theories of Darwin, which offered hopes for an extraordinary advance in understanding the world. Freud reached his decision to enter the field of medicine upon hearing a dramatic reading of Goethe's essay on Nature. His youthful idealism was given direction by the old master's romantic picture of Nature as a bountiful mother, who allowed her favorites the privilege of exploring her secrets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Freud had come to believe that the secret of power lay in understanding rather than in force. Swayed by the late-nineteenth-century Zeitgeist, he questioned humankind's relation to itself as well as its place in Nature. With his father's blessings and financial support, Freud embarked on his career as a medical student at the University of Vienna in the autumn of 1873. His work load averaged over twenty-five hours per week, including lectures and laboratories, in such broadly diversified fields as anatomy, chemistry, botany, microscopy, mineralogy, physics, spectrum analysis, biology, histology, Aristotelian logic, physiology, and zoology. The budding genius thereby acquired a solid scientific background in addition to the habits of hard work and self-discipline. During this academically successful period Freud began to recognize the limitations as well as the capabilities of his intellectual gifts. He learned also the truth of the Mephistophelean dictum: "It is in vain that you range round from science to science; each man learns only what he can." After receiving his first grant in 1876 to study the gonadic structure of eels, Freud found a temporary home in Ernst Briicke's physiology laboratory. Briicke was for Freud a role model as well as an intellectual mentor. He was an exemplar of the person of science—uncompromising, ascetic, disciplined. An austere German Protestant professor with a Prussian accent, Briicke represented the antithesis of the Viennese schlamperai (or "sloppy thinkers") with whom Freud was already familiar. Briicke's Institute of Physiology was part of a far-reaching scientific movement known as the Helmholtz school of medicine, whose teachings made a lasting impression on Freud. Its founders, all to become famous scientists, had sworn a youthful oath to uphold the principles: No other forces than the common physical-chemical ones are active within the organism. In those cases which cannot at the time be explained by these forces one has either to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical-mathematical method or to assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the forces of attraction and repulsion.1 By 1870 this current of thought had achieved complete dominion over the minds of the German psychologists and medical teachers; it stimulated research everywhere. Helmholtz's mid-nineteenth-century mechanical view of the universe, which reduced all natural phenomena to the forces of attraction and repulsion, was incorporated by Briicke into his Lectures on Physiology (1874). The student Freud was captivated by his teacher's account of physical physiology. Briicke defined physiology as the science of organisms. He distinguished between organisms and machines; the latter were mere dead material entities in action, while the former possessed the faculty of assimilation.

<p class="calibre1">However, both were considered to be phenomena of the physical world. According to the principle of the conservation of energy, organisms and machines were similarly composed of systems of atoms and driven by forces. In science the real causes were symbolized by the word "forces." The less scientists knew about these causes, claimed Briicke, the more kinds of forces they had to distinguish: mechanical, electrical, magnetic, light, heat, and so forth. Progress in knowledge had reduced these forces to two—attraction and repulsion. Briicke extended this line of reasoning to the human organism. He incorporated this nineteenth-century image of humankind into two volumes of what was then known about the interplay of physical forces inside the living organism. That Freud was influenced strongly by the content and spirit of these ideas is revealed in his 1926 characterization of the dynamic aspect of psychoanalysis as forces that assist or inhibit one another and combine with and enter into compromises with one another. His image of the human being, as we shall see, was tinged heavily with the mechanistic view, which he absorbed as a student at Briicke's institute. With the aid of a photographic memory Freud passed his final medical examination in 1881 with flying colors. During that year he found Theodor Meynerfs lectures on psychiatry of particular interest because of their non- laboratory approach to medical science. Although he wanted to pursue a theoretical career, his financial situation upon receipt of his M.D. was so shaky that he accepted Briicke's advice to abandon this ambition. He served as doctor in residence at the Vienna General Hospital, where he gained three years of experience in surgery, internal medicine, dermatology, and psychiatry. One year before his marriage to Martha Bernays in 1886, the twenty- nine-year-old Freud was seeking the professional recognition that would enable him to establish a private practice and to start a family. He hoped that his discovery of the clinical use of cocaine as a local anesthetic would earn him early fame. Using himself as a guinea pig Freud observed that cocaine produced exhilaration and lasting euphoria; it increased his capacities for self- control and intensive mental work. Although it aided him in controlling the contents and flow of his consciousness, preoccupation with the magical rather than the medicinal properties of the drug cost him credit for the find. A younger colleague, Carl Koller, won the distinction of inaugurating the use of cocaine on the sensitive eye surface. Freud had yet to prove his worth. The Interpretation of Dreams Prior to Freud the field of psychiatry was relatively virgin territory. The great French scientists Jean Charcot and his student Pierre Janet had established a lone outpost with their work on hypnosis and hysteria.2 The relationship between Charcot, with whom Freud studied during the years 1885-1886, and Janet was akin to that between Saint-Simon and Comte. 2Hysteria may be briefly defined as the experiencing of mental anxiety and/or bodily pain without an apparent physical cause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saint-Simon and Charcot were the inspirational thinkers, while Comte and Janet, their disciples, were the systematizers. It was Janet who delved deeply into the psychic process of hysteria and found, according to the theories of heredity that dominated fin de siecle French psychology, that the disease was a form of degeneration of the nervous system that manifested itself in congenital "weakness." Since Freud's pioneering psychiatric work, forms of mental illness (including hysteria) have come to be viewed largely as socially conditioned, although organic causes can combine with social ones. The background role of heredity in mental illness remains obscure, even after almost a century of research. Upon publication of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900 Freud began to emerge from obscurity. He had been practicing neurology and psychiatry for a decade in Vienna. In 1897 he began an arduous self-analysis, which gave him greater insight into the resistance of his patients and laid the foundations for his system of psychoanalysis. His revolutionary scientific work examined for the first time in a comprehensive and systematic manner the previously unsuspected notion that the fulfillment of a wish was the essential motive of a dream. The conquistador of the irrational had struck ore in an unexplored land. His first great discovery on this hidden continent was the "dirty little secret" that people lust and hate. Although this came as no surprise to the lower classes, the established middle and upper classes, including their learned scientists and scholars, were shocked by such a picture of themselves. The mere mention of Freud's name was considered impolite and risque in the genteel drawing rooms of Viennese society. Respectable society followed the leaders of nineteenth-century European intellectual life in considering their civilization the summit of human progress. The social evolutionary trend of nineteenth-century sociological and anthropological thought, including the work of Comte, Frazer, Morgan, Tylor, and Spencer, had convinced modern Europeans of their cultural superiority to the so- called barbaric or primitive peoples. These modern Europeans, secure in their conversation parlor, stereotyped native tribespeople as packs of painted savage, drum-beating cannibals, and promiscuous sexual libertarians. Since the nineteenth century had a way of turning Victorian moral absolutes into hereditary categories, Europeans came to believe the myth that they were racially superior to black Africans. The latter were considered to be subhuman, abnormal, and sexually unrestrained. Freud disturbed Europe's sleep by showing in his case studies and dream analyses of respectable society matrons that the moral barrier between "normal" and "pathological" scarcely existed and that the sexual underground was much bigger than anyone was willing to admit. Repression Freud's greatest discovery on this new continent was the phenomenon of repression. The entire structure of psychoanalysis is based upon the foun-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dation of repression as it operates in the human being. According to Freud, random thoughts, dreams, slips of the tongue, neurotic symptoms, and daily mistakes all have meanings (that is, express intentions or purposes) that are unknown to the person. They are what he calls "unconscious ideas." The individual who is undergoing psychoanalysis resists becoming aware of unconscious ideas that may threaten his or her established sense of self. The individual's rejection of an idea or a desire that he or she nevertheless possesses is repression. It functions to keep things out of consciousness; its consequence is that the individual refuses to recognize the realities of his or her human nature. In his first major work Freud divides the mental apparatus into three components. He compares the unconscious system to an anteroom, which houses the various excitations, desires, ideas, drives, and instincts. These elements push forward to gain admission into a second and much smaller room that houses consciousness. A doorkeeper or "censor" stands between these two rooms in the parlor of the preconscious, so to speak. The doorkeeper scrutinizes ideas and excitations that seek admittance, and those that are turned back at the threshold are repressed. Freud found in numerous clinical cases that repression occurred where there was a conflict between opposing wishes and desires. In addition, he found f"iat experiences that were the occasions for such conflict almost invariably had sexual content. Freud relates the case of a girl who felt great relief upon her older sister's death. Since she could not recognize consciously the envy of her deceased sister, whose husband was now available to marry her, the girl became hysterical. She had repressed the thought, "Now he is free and can marry me." During the course of psychoanalysis she was able to remember the thought and to reproduce the intense excitement that she had experienced upon the occasion of her sister's death. In a burst of emotion, her conscious mind had suddenly recognized the unconsciously repressed material. By reliving that trauma from her past, she effected her own cure. Next came one of Freud's keenest insights: that people with the highest ideals tend to have the greatest repression of strong aggressive and sexual desires. This empirical generalization, based on his observations of patients, suggested that ideals were founded on repression and that they took their vitality from the suppressed feelings themselves. In short, uptight, honest, hard-working, righteous, authoritarian believers in the Protestant ethic derive their energetic tension from love and hate turned in upon themselves. Freud later cited Woodrow Wilson's intense moral idealism as an example of this character type. A third discovery, one that stemmed directly from the theory of repression, was that children have sex lives. The seemingly obvious notion that children are sexual creatures so roused the ire of his contemporaries that they ostracized him. However, Freud stuck to his empirical guns. In analyzing dreams and neurotic symptoms, he found that they contained a core that represented a return or regression to early childhood experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming the validity of the hypothesis of the unconscious, it follows that children learn to repress their emotions. At one point they are innocent and unrepressed. The unconscious and conscious are not yet separated. Wishes to play with their orifices, genitals, and feces are freely indulged. It is only through the process of socialization, when the child begins to internalize the parents' values of cleanliness, propriety, and order, that the child learns to behave in a "proper" manner and to tailor himself or herself to society's norms. FREUD'S EXPLANATORY SYSTEMS Freud evolved several major explanatory systems during the course of his career: (1) the theory of primary and secondary process; (2) the theory of stages of sexual development; (3) the libido theory; (4) the trinitarian theory of the psychic apparatus; and (5) the theory of Eros versus the death instinct. Although none of these systems is self-contained and discrete from the others, we may isolate each for the purposes of analysis. The fabric of Freud's thought is sewn with many threads, and in order to unravel the whole, it helps to proceed from earlier to later systems. Primary and Secondary Process Freud's earliest system began with the act of repression itself, which he explained in terms of the "primary process," as expressed in wishes, symbols, and fantasies; and the "secondary process" of our socialized awareness, which censors and controls the former. Each concept may be used to refer to either ways of thinking or ways of managing energy. Freud contends that humankind transcends its animality by undergoing a basic change from primary process, ruled by the unconscious system and the vicissitudes of the id instincts, to secondary process, dominated by the conscious system and the demands of the ego. Although primary process persists into adulthood, the mature ego is able to control the childlike id by denying gratification, restraining pleasure, working to achieve rational goals, and remaining secure from irrational passions. Freud describes this dynamic shift within the human psyche as the transformation of the pleasure principle into the reality principle. Beyond seeking mere instinctual satisfaction, human beings develop the faculty of reason and learn to test reality; they discover that making distinctions, such as good from bad, true from false, and useful from useless, is the beginning of wisdom. Human beings thereby metamorphose from pleasure-loving babies into conscious, thinking subjects located within a social system that demands that they function properly in their economic roles. Of course, they are free to have a fantasy life; however, they must ultimately subordinate their mentality to the reality principle (that is, they must obey society's norms and live according to its values). They may have strange dreams, weird thoughts, irrational wishes, powerful desires, or immoral fantasies, but they</p>
<p class="calibre1">must not let the imagination run away with itself to the point of excluding external reality. For example, James Thurber's beloved character Walter Mitty imagines himself to be a famous brain surgeon in the act of performing a crucial operation on a millionaire banker who is a close personal friend of Roosevelt, only to have a parking lot attendant shout at him to stop his car before he slams into a Buick. The Stages of Sexual Development One of Freud's major hypotheses is that the first five years are crucial in the further psychological development of the person. It is during this phase of life that the link between the individual and society is forged. Talcott Parsons later interpreted this to mean that the child acquires a superego (or conscience) during this period by identifying with parental values. Since the parents are society's cultural agents, the child will learn the dominant values from them. If cultural values are success oriented, as they are in America, the child will be encouraged to gear its organism toward the achievement of such desirable goals as position, power, and prestige. The will toward acquisition of goods, from soap to status, is thereby built into the individual by society from an early age. From his observations of patients and their neuroses Freud developed a model of five overlapping stages of psychosexual development: oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital. During the earliest stage infants derive gratification from sucking the mother's breast. The erogenous zones of the mouth and lips are the first to come into play in deriving sexual pleasure. During this oral, or cannibalistic, phase the amoral baby makes no distinction between taking food and sexual activity. The suckling aims to incorporate the object (mother's breast) into its own body; it still lives according to the primary process of striving for instant gratification and has not yet developed the secondary process by which it distinguishes itself from the world and separates subject from object. The baby is the universe; it is at one with the environment. During the latter part of this stage the child begins biting; it becomes oral-sadistic. It begins to objectify and to differentiate itself from its surroundings. Although it does not yet know their names, it begins to locate such objects as the breast, the nipple, the blanket, the rattle. It encounters its first significant "other"—mother. It is cutting its first teeth and it explores the world by grasping things, shoving them into its mouth, and chewing on them. It is not sure whether to bite or suck. It is ambivalent. This primeval uncertainty, Freud argues, is the prototype for the polar emotions of love and hate. During the anal phase of the organization of the libido the child concentrates its energy on the anus as a source of gratification. The child becomes fascinated with its feces and enjoys playing with them. Excrement is viewed as an extension of itself without any connotations of good or bad; it is neutral waste. Through the mother the child learns, via the diaper change, that excrement is bad. This routine is a rather unpleasant task, however loving the mother. The helpless nursling, who is emotionally sensitive to even the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subtlest nuance of facial expression and tactile sensation, sees and feels the parent's distaste at this daily ritual. The role of this early memory trace or psychic imprinting upon the baby can hardly be overestimated in the course of individual development. Excrement becomes negative, associated in the child's mind with the smelly, dirty "bad-me." The clean "good-me" of the child is rewarded with parental smiles and verbal acclaim for not soiling its clothes. Toilet training is the beginning of civilization in the individual. The seeds of society and repression are sown by teaching the child self- (that is, bowel) control. During the phallic stage of psychosexual development the individual discovers the genital erogenous zone as a source of pleasure. The penis for the male and the clitoris for the female become the primary organs of sexual excitement. Freud understood the initial sexual instincts of childhood to be largely objectless, or "autoerotic." The key stage of development is the phallic, at which the Oedipus complex emerges, for this is the point at which sexual drives become firmly attached to an external object. Harking back to the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex to find an archetype for his clinical diagnoses, Freud theorized that the young male desires his mother and hates and fears his father. (For the female child, he expected the process to be the reverse.) The male child resolves this conflict by repressing the wish to kill his father; he identifies with him instead and makes him his personal ego- ideal. Thereafter, the internalized father (or superego) punishes the child by making him feel guilty whenever he wishes for something forbidden. The external punisher has taken up residence inside the child's own mind. According to Freud, sexual interests are submerged during the latency period between the ages of five and twelve, to reappear again at puberty in the genital or adult stage of sexual organization. During these years between the phallic stage and puberty, the child learns from its initial social environment, its family and school, how to channel its sexual feelings into socially acceptable behavior. Although Freud postulated the Oedipus complex as sociologically universal, ethnographic work by Malinowski and other cultural observers has disconfirmed this hypothesis. The concept does, however, provide the student of humankind with a heuristic device for understanding the individual's advance from bondage to freedom. As long as the individual remains attached in an emotionally dependent way to the parents, personal independence has yet to become a reality. Freud based his encompassing theory of neurosis upon fixation at the oedipal or one of the preoedipal stages, due to some conflict over gratification. In addition, some personal trauma in adult life may bring about temporary neurotic regression to an earlier mode of gratification. The Theory of Libido Freud's image of humankind reflected the mechanistic bias of his contemporaries. For Freud, as for other middle-class thinkers of his time, humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">were perceived as primarily isolated and self-sufficient. They were alone in a universe not of their making and found themselves, somewhat akin to Hobbes' imaginary atomic individual, surrounded by others in the same predicament. Uprooted from the medieval context of soil, hearth, and community, nineteenth-century urban individuals' needs for commodities drove them to the marketplace, where they encountered other individuals who needed what they had to sell and who had to sell what they needed. Society's cement consisted in this mutually profitable exchange. The wheeling and dealing for the material advantages took place on the vast stock-exchange floor of life under the guidance of Adam Smith's "invisible hand" of the self-adjusting market. Freud's libido theory, as we shall see, expressed the same idea in psychological rather than economic terms. The French aristocrat and homme de belles-lettres La Mettrie argued cogently in 1748 that humankind is a complicated machine. Although Freud probably never read La Mettrie, he did pick up this theme. Freud's mechanical human was driven by libido (basic sexual energy) and regulated by the need to reduce tension to a certain minimal threshold. Pleasure consisted in an unwinding or reducing of tissue tensions and in the avoidance of pain. The barometer of well-being was a kind of tepid mean between ecstasy and depression. Males and their mechanical brides sought each other out in order to arrive at mutual satisfaction of their libidinous needs. Nevertheless, they remained as fundamentally alienated from one another as seller and customer on the market. Despite their mutual attraction, they remained at opposite magnetic poles and could never transcend their sepa- rateness. According to Freud, humankind's nature is fundamentally aggressive and asocial, and humans are social animals only by virtue of the necessity to satisfy the ravenous libido. The concept of libido is essentially a nineteenth-century economic idea in psychological dress, in the sense that it is conceived of as a fixed quantity subject to the laws of matter. One may spend it as one pleases, but once it is spent it cannot be recovered. In the same way, Freud treats love as property or capital. Love was considered as a valuable commodity to be invested wisely and not merely to be frittered away on every passing stranger. Hence, Freud despaired of the possibility of altruistic love, except among the psychoanalytic elite; he ridiculed the commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself" as an absurdity. Ego, Id, and Superego Freud's mature system emerged as a three-element conception of the psychic topography. The ego (cognition of the external world), the id (the emotional or instinctual being), and the superego (identifications and social ideals) were portrayed as dynamically interrelated regions or "psychic localities" within the mind of humankind. These concepts are ideal types in the Weberian sense. They function as diagnostic categories, which are neither separately observable entities nor physical portions of the brain;</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather they are interactive mental principles that are always found in mixed form. For example, the primitive id drives become fixed on (or "cathected to") certain objects, such as mother, father, or self. These object cathexes are incorporated by the unconscious system of the mental apparatus and act as the building blocks of the emerging character structure of the individual. The ego is a structure or organization of the mental process by which the human being stays in contact with social reality. It represents the viewpoint of Reason, which constrains the limitless passions and impulsive desires of the irrational id. The ego simultaneously draws energy from and acts as the agent of the id. The outpouring of "how to" books for single men and women—how to find a mate or how to seduce a member of the opposite sex most effectively and deliriously—illustrates this point. The superego emerges as a function of the ego. It arbitrates the relationship between the ego and the external world and even punishes the ego. The superego is the interior judge, which represents the moral demands of society and reinforces the authority principle as it operates in the affairs of human beings. One of the major fruits of this tripartite system was Freud's essay "Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego," in which he set forth an explanation of the foundation of social unity and its dissolution. Taking Gustave Le Bon's treatise on The Crowd as a springboard for analysis, Freud sought to fathom the willingness with which the ordinarily civilized individual subordinates his or her ego to the mindlessness and destructive tendencies of the group (that is, individuals en masse). Since Freud's basic premise was that social cohesion is based on sexual organization, it followed that the libidinal bond, rather than a community of interest, was the power that cemented the group. Beyond sex, what held society together was the dynamic psychic mechanism of identification, whereby a number of separate individuals join together by substituting a common object for their ego ideal. Freud interpreted the ruler as a father image, an answer to people's wish to be led. Thus, the persecuting primal father becomes the "cultural superego," or what Comte called the "Great Being of Humanity," who is incarnated as the totalitarian dictator and invested by the people with supreme temporal power. Charismatic leaders, as Weber reminds us, derive their domination from neither legal nor traditional sources; rather, their authority and power to command are founded in the collectivity's perception of their possession of extraordinary, unique, and magical qualities. Alexander the Great, Caesar, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon, Lenin, and Hitler are examples of such politically charismatic personality types. Louis XIV, the divine-right monarch of seventeenth-century France, epitomized the secular sanctity of this administrative function in the famous historical aside, "L'etat, c'est mot" (I am the state). The absolutist political leader thereby places himself or herself in the stead of the subjects' parents, and the subjects tend to obey readily and even to worship that leader.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eros Versus the Death Instinct Freud's culminating explanatory system seeks speculatively to understand the individual and history in life-and-death terms. In the history of culture Eros may be distinguished from Agape; the former recalls the Greek ideal of passionate love between human beings by means of which each overcomes the sense of separateness, and the latter refers to the concept of altruistic love, according to which we are all one. Freud treats the two of these together in contrast to Thanatos, which represents the personification or mask of death in Greek mythology; it is the harbinger of suicide, war, pestilence, and famine. Like elliptic cycles, each of these heavenly powers, as Freud called them, recurs periodically in the rise and fall of civilizations and individuals. Transsexuality is a recent gender category in the sociology of sex; and despite Freud's scientific metholology and tolerant attitude toward homo sexualis, he had no transsexual clients in Victorian-era Vienna. Hence, his theory was consequently void of their mention. In the life of individuals Eros stands for the sexual instincts. More specifically, it points toward those modes of human sexuality that have been categorized as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual. Whereas the dominant social value of heterosexuality may be understood as the attainment of genitality, and homosexuality as oedipal identification with the wrong sex, bisexuality gained little or no stature in Freud's psy- chomorphology, except for the indication that polymorphous perversity might be a characteristic of early childhood. However, one of the most revolutionary implications of Freud's psychology of sex is the postulate of the universal bisexuality of human beings. In seeking to explain neuroses and perversions, Freud borrowed his colleague Wilhelm Fleiss's concept of constitutional bisexuality. Fleiss contended that this condition is biologically based in male and female characteristics, which are present in both men and women. Although Freud rejected the organismic in favor of the psychological viewpoint, he accepted the validity of the theory of bisexuality as explaining many traits of human behavior. Freud's brilliant and wayward disciple Carl Jung picked up this theme of male-in-female and female-in- male, translating it in terms of archetypes of human consciousness rather than biological fixtures or psychological entities. Whatever the individual's mode of conduct, the theory of bisexuality sheds light on Agape as well as Eros, for it shows the human being as capable of expressing tender as well as aggressive emotions. Looming in the Freudian unconscious are death and sexual instincts. Drawing upon August Weismann's heuristic division of the living substance into mortal (or "somatic") and immortal (or "germ plasmic") parts in multicellular organisms, Freud deals with two forces operating in the substance. While the sexual instincts perpetually strive to renew life, the death instincts seek to lead the living toward death. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud postulates the "nirvana principle," according to which "the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominating tendency of mental life, and perhaps of nervous life in general, is the effort to reduce, to keep constant, or to remove internal tension due to stimuli." This proclivity in the life of human beings finds partial expression in the pleasure principle, which strives to reduce the tension of desires by satisfying them. In addition, Freud uses the nirvana principle as a basis for believing in the existence of death instincts. He assumes that life is striving to return to an initial state of things from which it originally departed. Thus, "the aim of all life is death." On the supraindividual or historical level the death instinct manifests itself in periods of cultural degeneration, civil war, and international antagonisms. Indeed, the present age has been characterized by Raymond Aron as "the century of total war." Of course, history is replete with wars, plagues, famines, revolutions, crumbling civilizations, and the like. It was Hegel who once remarked that "what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history." The radical difference between today and yesterday is that with the technological development of nuclear weapons and sophisticated methods of chemical-biological warfare, our species now has within its power the means to extinguish itself entirely. Freud was a pessimist with regard to human affairs. He recognized a death wish in the collectivity as well as in the individual. But he had not completely given up hope. In the concluding paragraphs of Civilization and Its Discontents Freud invokes the life force, Eros, as the other heavenly power to rise up and defeat its equally immortal adversary, Thanatos. LATER CAREER In his later years, Freud turned to the elder-philosopher role and began to comment on the issues of war and peace, the drift of modern secular history, and the place of humankind in the biological cosmos. To the end of his days in 1939 Freud wore the mantle of scientist-explorer. In a lengthy letter to Einstein in 1932 Freud expressed the hope that a combination of the "cultural attitude" against war and the fear of the consequences of a future war might result in its elimination as an outmoded institution. In Civilization and Its Discontents he posed the key question of the modern era: Is not civilization founded upon repression, and, if so, is not the universal neurosis of humankind its price? Unlike Marx, who sees the historical deck as stacked against the collectivity, Freud sees it as stacked against the individual. In lieu of homo economicus Freud presents us with an image of humankind as homo sexualis, whose irrational drives must be channeled into productive labor in order for civilization to carry on. Society sublimates sex into the striving for success. As a champion of the Enlightenment, Freud was highly suspicious of any notions that would contradict his famous dictum, "Where id is, there shall ego be." Although he was not blind to suffering and to the sources and means for overcoming it, he maintained his rational posture and dis-</p>
<p class="calibre1">missed religion as a consolation for the person who possesses neither art nor science. In The Future of an Illusion he psychoanalyzes religion as a projected superego of the helpless individual who identifies with an omnipotent and omniscient God, the father-king. Like the skeptical Voltaire, Freud wanted to live without illusions and preferred to cultivate Reason's garden. THE FREUDIAN MOVEMENT: ADLER AND JUNG Within the span of a half-century, the psychoanalytic movement gathered disciples, both wayward and orthodox, and established professional associations in countries around the globe. Psychoanalytic thinking has penetrated the social sciences as well as the humanities. Whole societies have been explained by a cultural "unconscious," and studies on the sexual customs and habits of populations have been published. No longer is a classic appreciated on the sole basis of art for art's sake; nowadays, we inquire a la Freud into the artist's early childhood secrets or sexual hangups to see what really makes him or her tick. By 1909 Freud had achieved international recognition. In that year he journeyed to America to deliver a series of lectures at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. He gave five talks in German to large audiences on the fundamental techniques of psychoanalysis and was generally well received by such American psychological luminaries as Adolf Meyer, Edward Titchener, and William James. The lectures were published as The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement. In this polemic he explained his revolutionary ideas, sketched the movement's history, and castigated Alfred Adler and Carl Jung as heretics. Adler was more concerned with the phenomenon of power in society, and he based his psychotherapy upon the patient's neurotic sense of power- lessness or inferiority. The thrust of his teaching was the attempt to understand and to cure this condition by the psychotherapeutic reawakening of social interest. Adler comprehended sexual conflicts more as products of the individual's maladjustments in his later social milieu than as reflections of early childhood difficulties. Adler, Karl Menninger, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Carl Rogers emphasized social more than sexual factors in the etiology of mental illness. Notwithstanding Freud's early indignation at this line of approach, their work has made the greatest impact upon the practice of psychotherapy in America. Carl G. Jung (1875-1961), Freud's most influential disciple, was born in a suburb of Basel, Switzerland, the son of a Protestant minister. Religious experiences in early childhood helped Jung to transcend the psychic ropes of the conventional piety of the Church, which he observed to be more concerned with rituals, rites, and roles than with considering Jesus Christ and the spirit of God as a living reality. He was a lonely youth, read everything he could, and chose the study of medicine as a compromise between the sci-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ences and humanities. He was attracted to psychiatry as the study of "diseases of the personality," became interested in psychic phenomena, and wrote his thesis "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena." Jung did his internship at the Burgholzli Medical Hospital in Zurich, which became his permanent home. He studied with Pierre Janet, the famous French psychiatrist, in 1902, set up an experimental laboratory at the Psychiatric Clinic, and invented the word-association test for psychiatric purposes. He became a lecturer and senior physician there in 1905 and sent copies of his articles and his first book, The Psychology of Dementia Praecox, to Freud. His intellectual mentor invited him to Vienna and the pair of great psychologists talked non-stop for thirteen hours in their first dialogue. Weekly correspondence followed, and Freud came to regard Jung as his Jung's Structure of the Psyche</p>
<p class="calibre1">Signtund Freud: Conquistador of the Irrational 155 successor because of the disciple's deep insight as well as his scientific connections in the Christian society of early-twentieth-century Europe. Although they maintained a close friendship, the founding fathers of psychology had basic disagreements. Freud insisted that the causes of repression are always sexual trauma and Jung disagreed. He saw humans as more than biological and sexual beings and took an interest in the way occult, mythological, and spiritual phenomena were interwoven throughout daily life and the case histories of his patients. Jung published Symbols of Transformation in 1912, which analyzed the Freudian concept of libido as generalized psychic energy and contained other ideas that varied from Freud. Jung's increasing self-reliance caused a break between himself and Freud, but Jung stood by his own convictions despite the pain of the split from his guru. Unlike Freud, who traveled little, Jung was more cosmopolitan; he visited Africa, India, and the Pueblo Indians, and studied non-European cultures while developing his own theories of the unconscious and religious symbolism. When their collaboration ended in 1913, Sandor Ferenczi, an associate of Freud's, quipped, "The Jung no longer believe in Freud." Jung is in accord with Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, Sumner, Cooley, and Mead in the assumption that society precedes the individual in the inter- connectedness of mind as well as the ways in which the individual expresses in his or her personality the characteristics of the culture as a whole and the qualities of the historical phase in which we live. The following interrelated concepts are relevant for the comprehension of Jung in sociological and historical terms: the psyche; psychic energy; archetypes and history; the persona; anima and animus; the attitudes and functions; and the collective unconscious. The circle motif pervaded Jungian psychology and the self is portrayed as the central archetype of the total personality. Jung conceived of an archetype as a form or image of a collective nature which occurs cross-culturally. In the individual product it is unconscious. The concept of the unconscious in the Jungian topography of the psyche occupies a much vaster space than that of the conscious. The unconscious includes the nonwaking stages of dream and deep sleep and is divided into personal and collective aspects. The personal unconscious contains psychic contents which have been repressed or forgotten and drives which have not reached the layer of consciousness. It contains material which has been in consciousness or may be potentially in consciousness and is related to a particular individual. The psyche is the functional starting point for analyzing the framework of Jung's thinking. It is a container, and when he asks what moves in its "space," he discovers "energy." He borrowed the Freudian term libido for instinctual sexual energy and redefined it as psychic energy, or the energy of the processes of life. Jung had a larger and more flexible concept of energy than Freud, as the energy is expressed on the cosmic level of life in the sociological network of relationships, and on the individual plane of the psyche of the human being. Jung takes a dialectical orientation based on the idea that all forms of life may be understood as a struggle of contending</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces. Male and female, yang and yin, destruction and creation, death and rebirth, cold and hot, suffering and joy, damnation and salvation, pain and pleasure, doubt and faith, despair and hope, hate and love are all examples of the constant dance and drama of the pairs of opposites. Jung saw all life as energy and the principle of opposites is an integral part of his conception of the psyche. Yet he always remained aware that the map is not the territory. According to Jung, the amount of psychic energy generated varies directly with the intensity and depth of a conflict, and he stated that the greater the tension between the pairs of opposites, the greater will be the energy that is set loose. The psychic energy that is generated by the dynamic interplay of the pairs of opposites is the moving force of society. The process of self-indication and the interaction of selves in institutions and organizations are driven by the libido and psychic energy. Just as the central archetype of the personality is the self, which functions as the nucleus from which the ego and persona radiate, so the primal archetypes of religious symbolism are God and the Messiah. All world religions have names for God, and the most sacred object, in the Durkheimian sense, is the legend and myth of the Messiah as the expectation of the Coming One. This empirical phenomenon is a matter of comparative religion and not mystical wish-fulfillment. The archetypes and history converge at a deep level of the collective unconscious as the panorama of a world historical age in themes such as the Second Coming of Christ, the Advent of the Messiah, and the return of the Mahdi in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The rise of Panduranga Vittala and the Coming of the Maitreya Buddha appear in Hinduism and Buddhism. This arrival of a Great Savior has been forecast by all world religious scriptures, tribal story-teller sages, mythologies, and folklore of the human race. The Messiah archetype may be another name for a highly refined and infinitely renewable energy. Jung's concept of the persona is similar to the Mead-Cooley theory of the social self. The persona is the way we present ourselves to one another in daily life, and Jung referred to it as the mask individuals wear for social intercourse. The life process is conceived of as a theater of social encounters in various milieux, and the ego projects images of a persona that is suitable to the situation as it emerges. Thus, the persona includes social roles, the clothes and costumes we wear, and our styles of self-expression in ideas, speech, facial gestures, and body language. The persona functions as a cover for the inner life of the individual in the stage play of society, which requires easily identifiable occupational categories and basic attitudes, such as amiability or harshness. While Freud postulated the constitutional bisexuality of human nature, Jung recognized that in every man there is a woman and within every woman there is a man. The Jungian psyche is balanced by the feminine side in men, which he called the anima, and by the masculine side in women, which he called the animus. The feminist movement owes a good measure of its success to the growth of the animus factor in the female population, while the gay liberation movement has been partially fueled by the rise of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the anima element in the male population. Jung even asserted a biological basis for these sexual opposites within the personality. Although Jung's biological claim has not been demonstrated, the concepts of the anima and the animus play an important role in the social psychology of sex. Notwithstanding the androgynous person's mode of integrating the anima and animus, Jung explains introversion and extroversion as the atti- tudinal types which symbolize the inward and outward movement of the reservoir of psychic energy. They are ideal types, in the Weberian sense that no individual conforms all the time to either an inward or an outward orientation but lends in one direction or another depending on will and circumstance. The psychic energy is constantly expressed in four functions, two of which are termed rational and two nonrational. Thinking and feeling are defined as rational functions of the psyche because they involve the individual taking a deliberate attitude and action toward an object. The thinker interprets an object; the feeler judges it. Sensation and intuition are considered nonrational because they are not purposive. Jung saw the sensation function as passive because the object is experienced by the individual instead of acted upon. The function of intuition is such that during the nature of the process the individual does not seek directly to understand the object. An idea, an answer, etc., just "comes" to you, and is therefore nonrational. One should see the overlaps and variations in these functions and attitudes and not analyze them as neat and separate categories. They are heuristic devices for understanding psychological types and trends in society and history. For example, Jung contrasted Immanuel Kant, an introverted-thinking type, with Charles Darwin, an extroverted-thinking type. Both theoreticians developed thinking as their dominant function, but Darwin turned it outward and Kant inward. Jung said, "Darwin ranges over the wide fields of objective facts, while Kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge in general."3 The Collective Unconscious Jung borrowed Freud's bimodal paradigm of the structure of the psyche by portraying a division between the conscious mind and the huge realm of the unconscious. According to Jung, the human infant is born with a psychological, as well as a biological, heritage. The neonate inherits more than a human body with a long evolutionary past and the genes of its parents; the baby comes equipped with a kind of psychic receptacle Jung called the collective unconscious, which is filled with archetypes. He used the word "collective" to differentiate it from "personal" and to indicate its priority to the individual personality. It is not collective in the ordinary sociological meaning of joint possessiveness; rather, it is collective in the sense that it is something generically present in humans and collectively held by all people. The unconscious is not a negative concept, as in Freud. Jung refers to the unconscious as that vast reservoir of psychic energy out of which all the 3C. G. Jung, Psychological Types, trans, by H. G. Baynes (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1923), p. 484.</p>
<p class="calibre1">materials of consciousness emerge. Although the idea is amorphous and difficult to analyze, it is theorized as a positive and creative entity which supplies the symbols and other psychic contents which are brought to the surface of waking-state consciousness in daily life. Jung went beyond the psychological to the archetypal self in Modern Man in Search of a Soul. Jung understood that we live in anomic times, in an historical transition period from an old to a new order of society, and recognized that individuals have spiritual needs which transcend the economic marketplace, social status, and the political arena. As a psychiatrist, he assisted his patients on their paths of growth to individuation; he also explored the collective unconscious and pointed to the cross-cultural archetypes, such as the eternal wonder child (e.g., Jesus, Hermes, Moses, Zeus), the universal mother as earth goddess in Hindu, Greek, and Roman religions, the grandmother of the American Indians, and the hero cycles in world mythologies. Jung had a marvelous way as a therapist of bringing people to their creative selves in the individuation process of his analytic and depth psychology. Through the interpretation of dreams, myths, and symbols, he brought people to a higher level of awareness of their fund of psychic energy that is the source of self-fulfillment, worldly prosperity, and the ongoing symbolic interaction of society. And yet, Jung was aware of the shadow side of human nature, of the irrational element in the collective unconscious of civilization, represented by such death archetypes as Yama-Raj (God of Death in Hinduism), Thanatos (the Death Wish in Greek), and the Grim Reaper. Equating the archetypal self with "spirit" and "Christ" is counterbalanced in Jung's dualistic pairs of opposites schema by the shadow side of the inner executive ego, portrayed as a demon or the devil. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are built into the psyche and its social manifestations. The causes of World War II may be explored through a social orientation of Jung's psychology. Nazi Germany can be seen as a classic example of demons and the Wotan symbols (e.g., primitivism, violence, and cruelty) of pre-Christian Germanic mythology arising from the historical depths of the collective unconscious into the national character and social psychology of a modern warlike state. Speaking generally, Jung says, "It is—and always was—my opinion that the political mass movements of our time are psychic epidemics, i.e., mass psychoses."4 Jung thus made the connection between the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and history. FREUD'S LAST TESTAMENT Freud continued to live in his beloved Vienna until the situation there became intolerable. With the rise of Hitler to power in Germany the predicament of the Jews worsened. Psychoanalysis was "liquidated" in Germany. 4C. G. Jung, Essays on Contemporary Events (London: Kegan Paul, 1947), p. 79.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Freud's and other psychoanalytic books were burned in Berlin in 1933, and Jews were forbidden to serve on any scientific council. The Nazis seized control of the German Society for Psychotherapy, renamed it the International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, and required all members to make Hitler's Mein Kampf the basis for their work. Several official Nazi psychotherapists met with representatives of the society and informed them that psychoanalysis could continue only if Jews were excluded from membership. Threats accompanied pressure, and the leveling process continued as the various branches of science were "nationalized," brought under a central control, and geared to serve National Socialist aims. In lieu of Freud's psychoanalysis and Einstein's theory of relativity, Nazi science adopted the doctrine of Aryan racial superiority. With the Nazi invasion of Austria in March 1938, the streets of Vienna were lined with roaring tanks and trainloads of patriotic "extras" shouting, "Heil Hitler!" Freud was surprisingly reluctant to leave his native land; but his biographer and friend Ernest Jones managed to convince him to leave, and Jones arranged the complicated diplomatic details of Freud's emigration from Austria to England. However, the Nazis extracted their pound of flesh. They confiscated Freud's bank account and demanded a fugitive tax, without which they threatened to confiscate his library and art collection. During these trying times Freud worked an hour a day on his Moses and Monotheism, which tormented him like a "ghost not laid." During his short stay in London Freud continued to practice psychoanalysis, kept up his correspondence, worked consistently on Moses and Monotheism, and received visiting dignitaries. His callers included the writer H. G. Wells, the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, the painter Salvador Dali, and the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann. Three secretaries of the Royal Society asked him to sign its Charter Book, which contained the signatures of Newton and Darwin. Although Freud was in agony from a jaw cancer that eventually claimed his life, he received these accolades with the grace of a nobleman and maintained his sense of humor to the end. Upon hearing a radio announcement to the effect that this war was to be the last war, a friend asked Freud if he believed that. Freud replied, "Anyhow it is my last war." Freud's last will and testament was Moses and Monotheism. In this quasi- mystical, novelistic essay of self-discovery, Freud develops his general theory of monotheism, which focuses on Moses as the father figure and lawgiver of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Saul of Tarsus, the renegade rabbi who is commonly known as St. Paul, was to organize Christianity in early- second-century Rome on the foundations of original sin and salvation through sacrificial death. Saul's revelation was that human suffering is the effect of having murdered God the father, and his mission as the Apostle Paul was to preach that the sacrificial victim was indeed the long-awaited Messiah in the person of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Freud argued that Christianity, which emerged from ancient Judaism, became a "Son religion" as a result of having displaced the slain primal father. In Moses and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monotheism Freud not only amplified and extended the insights of Totem and Taboo and The Future of an Illusion; he was also reacting covertly to the oncoming pogrom. He concludes his book about Moses with the wry observation: "Only a part of the Jewish people accepted the new doctrine. Those who refused to do so are still called Jews." Beyond the personal meaning that this rather speculative work had for Freud, Moses and Monotheism is highly suggestive theoretically. Its methodology rests on the projection of the psychoanalytic procedure onto the world historical plane. The history of a people may be read as if it were the history of an individual, with the intention of unearthing the cultural secrets or "repressed content" of the collectivity, whether the latter be a cult, a nation, a religion, or a civilization. Research along this line might illuminate the phenomenon of leadership in accordance with Freud's emphasis on leaders as embodiments of the collective superego. Such an approach would allow freer reign for what Mills called "the sociological imagination" to come to grips with what is going on in today's world at the fine point where biography intersects with society and history. CRITICISM AND ADVANCES Freud's theories gave rise to a flurry of psychological experiments in the 1930s and 1940s. Most of these were dubious tests of his hypotheses; for example, attempts were made to test repression by seeing if people find it harder to remember unpleasant things than pleasant ones, even though the mechanism of repression was postulated only for strong instinctual drives and their derivatives. A combination of behaviorist orthodoxy and middle- class America's reluctance to deal with any of the strong emotional drives that Freud was discussing has meant that academic psychology has done little to follow up his leads. Clinical practice, on the other hand, has heeded Freud's recommendations to pay attention to emotions and behaviors of which we are not ordinarily conscious (for example, childhood experiences, sex, and aggression). That clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are ambivalent about the veracity of Freudian theories and the effectiveness of his therapeutic methods should not obscure the fact that Freud's most basic discoveries have been vindicated, so much so that they have almost passed into the realm of common knowledge. One criticism that may be leveled against Freud is that he reified his concepts. Notwithstanding his analytic disclaimers, he treated such mental ephemera as ego, id, superego, consciousness, and unconsciousness as if they were real objects; and Freudian terminology has come to be used by many professionals and laypeople in the same way. There is a measure of truth in the assertion that concepts, once entrenched in the literature, develop a life of their own; however, this linguistic phylogenesis must not blur the distinction between the real and the nominal. It should be underlined that Freud's conceptualizations are analytic tools rather than actual entities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, it may be said of Freud that he was culturally bound in his thought. His Eros/Thanatos duality is subject to this critique, in the sense that Freud's attitude toward death reflects a pessimistic period of Western thought. In conjunction with his contemporaries Freud regarded aging and death as the irresistible antithesis of life. This viewpoint contrasts with such recent Western European psychological paradigms of inner growth as Erikson's "ages of man" and Maslow's "hierarchy of needs," and contradicts Eastern doctrines of spiritual rebirth, through which aspirants attain enlightenment and come to see the world through the eyes of one newly born. Neither age nor sex is a barrier to this experience, as long as life is understood as a process of interior growth and personal development rather than as a slow decline into the grave. The most valid criticism of Freud is that he observed repressed, middle- class, Victorian men and women and generalized from them to all humankind. Twentieth-century anthropological research by Bronislaw Malinowski, Margaret Mead, and others has shown that neither the latency period nor the Oedipus complex is universal. The type of adult sexual repression that Freud found in the social milieu of his day is by no means characteristic of all cultures. In addition to traditional societies on the Asian, African, and South American continents, contemporary lower- and middle-class subcultures in Europe and North America have mores different from Freud's formulations. However, all of this does not invalidate Freud's work. It means, rather, that appropriate theoretical modifications must be made. Such innovations have been attempted by a group of "left-wing" Freudians, including Erik Erikson, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse, and Fritz Perls, who opened up a broad path for social and historical factors to enter this ongoing colloquy on human nature. If Freud's work is understood as describing a particular historical period, it is a valuable complement to that of Weber. The Protestant-ethic personality—hard-working, uptight, repressed, puritanical—is exactly what Freud was depicting. Thus, the dictum, "Neurosis is the price we pay for civilization" is the clinical insight corresponding to Weber's pessimism about the effects of rationalization and bureaucratization on the quality of modern life. Freud also complements Durkheim. Durkheim was of two minds about modern society. At first he argued that "organic solidarity" was a sufficient condition for social order, even though the contractual network first had to emerge from the emotionally binding "mechanical solidarity" of traditional societies. Later, after the Dreyfus affair and the tremendous conflict of turn- of-the-century France, Durkheim reconsidered and concluded that a purely formal, rules-and-regulations type of society created widespread anomie. As a social remedy for the normless state of affairs he advocated a return to workers' guilds, in which emotional solidarity could be found. Freud bolsters the later phase of his French contemporary's theory by suggesting that if people's feelings are overly repressed, any strains in the social order are</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely to cause a channeling of pent-up emotion into social movements that allow them an outlet. WAS FREUD A SEXIST? With the resurgence of feminism, Freud again became controversial. On the one hand, he has been accused of being sexist. Psychoanalysis justifies traditional male and female roles in society, keeping women in the home while men pursue outside careers. On the other hand, some feminist theorists have tried to use and revise Freud precisely in order to explain the sexism that has dominated the social world. On a certain level, it is true that Freud was an old-fashioned sexist. Despite the fact that most of his patients were women, he constantly wrote his theories from a male viewpoint. The Oedipus complex, the key to the psychic structure, is obviously a male problem: the little boy who must repress his desires for his mother and come to identify with his father. Freud never really explained how this worked in the case of females. His principal theory about women is one that has outraged feminists. Freud argued that a small girl, when she notices she lacks a penis, assumes that she has been castrated. This results in a lifelong sense of inferiority to men, and a more passive role in adult society. Should she exhibit aggressiveness or the desire to achieve in the masculine, public world, Freudians attribute this to her penis envy. Nevertheless, despite these serious drawbacks, a number of feminist thinkers have attempted to revise Freud to help explain why we have had a male-dominated society. Their analyses are not designed to show the inevitable, but to see just what it is that needs to be changed. Juliet Mitchell, one of the first to argue that women are economically subjugated, went on to state that the patriarchal system of male domination is nevertheless older than capitalism, and constitutes an independent force behind sexism. To understand this, it is necessary to see how love, sexuality, and motherhood are internalized within the female psyche; and Freudian theory comes in handy for this purpose. Among the most important of these feminist revisions of Freud is the theory of Nancy Chodorow. Her key question is, why do women do mothering in our society? Mothering, the process of taking care of a child, physically and especially emotionally, is not the same as sheer biological child- bearing or the nursing of an infant at the breast. Once children are born, their own biological mother need not be the person who takes care of them. This has been true especially since bottle feeding was first practiced. In fact, however, women do most of the mothering, caring for toddlers, and even older children. Some feminists even argue that women are mothering their whole lives: They mother their husbands at home, just as on the job as secretaries, nurses, or waitresses they are expected to perform mother-like roles for male bosses and customers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mothering, then, is a social role, not a biological one. It is not instinctual, Chodorow points out; studies show that both men and women react similarly to infants' cries and smiles, and among animals even males will often care for an infant of their species if left alone with one. Similarly, women who are separated from their infants for medical reasons shortly after childbirth do not develop as much affection for them. The mothering role is learned. But how? Chodorow draws on a version of Freudian themes for the answer. Both the infant boy and girl are cared for by a mother. In the original state of the child's psyche, there is no reality-oriented ego, but only a pleasurable merging with the other. It is this infant experience, according to Freud, that is the prototype of later sexuality; long afterwards, the child and then the grown adult seeks unconsciously to recapture this feeling by sexual contact (or some symbolic displacement of it). This transfer is inevitable; no one can remain an infant in mother's arms indefinitely. There are social pressures, too, in the form of incest taboos, which force the child to give up any sexual designs on the mother, and seek sex partners outside the family. For a boy, this process results in the classic Oedipus complex. The jealous father has a special role in depriving the son of his mother. The little boy, fearing his punitive father, not only gives up his sexual desires for his mother, but internalizes his father in the form of a superego, a kind of fantasy father that he identifies with and carries around inside his head. For a little girl, though, the break is not so severe. She is given more permission to be close and affectionate with her mother, even in a physical way. True, she too has to pull away, and fathers normally carry on a degree of flirta- tiousness with their daughters that is basic to encouraging them into a heterosexual role. But there is not the traumatic pressure as in the case of the boy. Moreover, the girl does not come to identify with her father, or internalize him as her superego. Instead she acquires a distinctively feminine superego, and indeed a whole feminine psychic apparatus or personality. This feminine personality is characterized by an underseparation between herself and other people. Whereas the boy develops a sharp separation between himself and the world, due to the forceful and abrupt giving up of his mother in the Oedipal complex, the girl does not experience this sharp division. Men turn out to be distant, oriented toward the world of objects, domineering, and achievement-driven. Women prefer intimacy and warmth in personal relationships, and define themselves more in relation to a group of others. And this, Chodorow concludes, is exactly what makes up the maternal personality. A mother is simply a typical female, finding her personality needs in being close to other people and submerging herself in the group— in this case, the group made up of her own family, and especially her children. Because of her continuing lack of psychic separation from her own mother, she has a need to continue this kind of close and nurturant relation with others. Mothering reproduces itself across the generations. Chodorow concludes that if women are to break out of this sex-typed</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation and take their places successfully in the larger society, this cycle of role reproduction must be broken. One way it can be broken is if men take a larger part in caring for children, especially emotionally. Then children will grow up with less radical separation between male and female worlds; psychologically, boys brought up in this way should have less of the depersonalizing split between self and others, while girls will identify more with fathers and acquire greater psychic entree into the hitherto male-dominated worlds of work, politics, and achievement. Chodorow's theory is not without its flaws. For one thing, sexist domination of society is not simply a matter of women willingly complying with nurturant feminine household roles. There are also the economic processes of which the Marxist feminists have written, and the sheer struggle for sexual domination from which men benefit. Moreover, Chodorow's women are too idealized: warm, loving, selfless creatures who have no demands of their own. In fact, plenty of women have been tough, aggressive, suspicious, or selfish, and have fought for position both inside the family and outside it. Chodorow fails to see enough conflict in society, either in the outer world where sexual discrimination is practiced, or in the family itself. Women have been quite capable of fighting with their husbands over family power when they have had the resources to do so. And mothering itself is not so idyllic as Chodorow makes it; women get angry at their children, sometimes even abusing them, and fight with their children over control more than they would like to admit. What has to be borne in mind is that Freud's perspective is one of conflict, too. The tendencies that Chodorow describes probably do exist, but they coincide with other tendencies—assertive and selfish ones—what Freud called the id. A mother can simultaneously love her children and fight with them, just as she can both nurture her husband and hate his patriarchal controls. It is this kind of inner conflict and ambivalence, in fact, that makes divorces so bitter, and makes the struggle for women's rights one of the most emotionally difficult of battles. Freudian theory thus continues to play an important part in our thinking today. Clearly the last word is not in on a theory of sexism in male-female relations. In addition to Chodorow and other feminist theorists who emphasize the mother role as the archetypal female activity, a theory of gender stratification has been developed from Freud's emphasis on sexual drives as a primary human desire. In this perspective, developed by Randall Collins on the basis of earlier theories of Kingsley Davis and Claude Levi-Strauss, men have sought to control women as erotic property. In earlier tribal societies, women were exchanged among groups to make political alliances. In modern society, men and women bargain directly in a sexual marketplace, in which men have up until now held most of the economic bargaining cards. In this perspective, it is not surprising that as women acquire greater economic resources of their own, they can afford to bargain with men less for men's earning power and more for their own sex-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ual attractiveness; hence the time of the feminist movement also turned out to be a time of erotic liberalization. Freud, in fact, may have been closer to this than we realize. Freud's own theories were paternalistically sexist, but his data were not. Bearing in mind that the first great wave of women's liberation in Europe began in the German-speaking countries around the turn of the twentieth century, one can put into perspective Freud's patients, mostly neurotic women from this very era, suffering from the family stresses of a newly emerging situation in which women were beginning to assert some independent rights. Freud may have misinterpreted what was going on, claiming to see in these conflicts an eternal psychic pattern when it may only have been an historically temporary one, as women struggled over sexual repression as a strategy within a male-dominated society. But the genius of a theorist may be to point at the crucial processes, more than to arrive immediately at the correct answer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER NINE The Discovery of the Invisible World: Simmel, Cooley, and Mead SIMMEL About the same time that Emile Durkheim was giving sociology a distinctive scientific identity in France, a similar attempt was being made in Germany. The German equivalent of Durkheim was Georg Simmel (1858-1918), whose career is strikingly similar to Durkheim's—and also strikingly different. For Durkheim was successful, and Simmel was not. Like Durkheim, Simmel formulated a view of society as a level of analysis independent of observable individuals, with laws of its own that required a separate science to investigate them. Simmel pointed out more clearly than anyone that since only individuals are physically real, the subject matter of sociology must be an invisible world of symbols and forms of interaction. He thus avoided some of the possible mystification inherent in Durkheim's "collective conscience." But Durkheim went on to become one of the most prominent thinkers in France, while Simmel spent twenty-nine long years waiting to be called to a professorship in Germany. All his life Simmel was an outsider, and his work shows both the strengths and weaknesses peculiar to that position. Simmel came from a wealthy and cultured Jewish family, and indeed his work is full of echoes of music, art, and drawing-room conversation. After studying philosophy, he became a privatdozent (private lecturer) at the University of Berlin in 1885. Not until 1914—just four years before his death—was he to gain the long-sought promotion to full professor. Forces conspired to keep him out. He was a Jew in a time of growing anti- Semitism, a liberal in Imperial Germany, the proponent of a discipline, sociology, that was associated with the un-German politics of Comte and Spencer. Simmel retreated more and more into the world of art and sociability, his sociology becoming a collection of insights—a theory of society, as it were, as if seen by a passerby, catching a few features as they struck 166</p>
<p class="calibre1">the eye but never penetrating to the heart of the edifice. Like the subject of one of his most famous essays, Simmel was the stranger who sees things that other humans, wrapped in their familiar routines, cannot see, a man privy to secrets given him because he has no one to tell them to. The formal background of Simmel's sociology was the tradition of German philosophy—Kant, Hegel, Dilthey, Wundt—which showed how humans see the world through a veil of their own perceptual forms and how these forms were passed on through human history in language, artistic ideals, myths, and legal systems. Accordingly, Simmel argues that society is an invisible world with laws of its own. These laws are found in the flow of culture—language, technology, social institutions, art—which molds each new generation along the lines of the past, and in forms or patterns of interaction among humans that have effects on what they may individually do. But humans are also living individuals. The culture that molds them and the interactions that constrain them are what make them human, but they are also something external and alien. The drama of humankind is, then, a struggle between the individual and the society—a drama that is fundamentally a tragedy, for the two forces must always exist together in every living person. Simmel's sensitivity to these two simultaneous levels of existence resulted in a striking insight, one that has been followed up only recently: The social institutions that make up the relatively permanent heritage of a society—the state, the family, the economy, the class structure—are only an extended version of the everyday interactions of men and women meeting on the street, in stores and offices, or at a party. Thus, by studying the formal structure of the more fleeting encounters, we reach the essence of our invisible society. "The interactions we have in mind when we talk about "society' are crystallized as definable, consistent structures such as the state and the family, the guild and the church, social classes and organizations based on common interests," wrote Simmel. But in addition to these, there exists an immeasurable number of less conspicuous forms of relationship and kinds of interaction. Taken singly, they may appear negligible. But since in actuality they are inserted into the comprehensive and, as it were, official social formations, they alone produce society as we know it. . . . Without the interspersed effects of countless minor syntheses, society would break up into a multitude of discontinuous systems. Sociation continuously emerges and ceases and emerges again. Even where its eternal flux and pulsation are not sufficiently strong to form organizations proper, they link individuals together. That people look at one another and are jealous of one another; that they exchange letters or dine together; that irrespective of all tangible interests they strike one another as pleasant or unpleasant; that gratitude for altruistic acts makes for inseparable union; that one asks another man after a certain street, and that people dress and adorn themselves for one another—the whole gamut of relations that play from one person to another and that may be momentary or permanent, conscious or unconscious, ephemeral or of grave consequence (and from which these illustrations are quite casually chosen), all these</p>
<p class="calibre1">incessantly tie men together. Here are the interactions among the atoms of society. They account for all the toughness and elasticity, all the color and consistency of social life, that is so striking and yet so mysterious.1 In one of his essays, Simmel speaks of men whose profession is to sit at home in full dinner dress, ready for a call from superstitious hostesses who find that they have a dinner party of thirteen about to sit down at table. Simmel was himself something of a "fourteenth man at dinner." Always the outsider, even in his chosen sphere of fleeting encounters, Simmel could not divest himself of his sociologist's detachment. Even more so than his later incarnation Erving Goffman (whom we shall meet in Chapter 13), Simmel was simultaneously within and without; neither completely participant nor completely observer; and his writings are a texture of insights that never quite make a solid system. \j Simmel was the first to remove sociability from the realm of the taken- for-granted and to analyze it as part of the social structure. Sociability, he pointed out, is a little world within the world, with laws all of its own. Here one did not allow practical and serious matters to intrude. The doings of the outer world might provide the starting place as subject matter for conversation, but the conversation was to rule the subjects and not vice versa. In the hands of skilled conversationalists, politics, business, art, gossip, the weather, all become the vehicle for talk that is carried on for the sake of talking, as raw material to be shaped by the formal requirements of these artists of fleeting symbols. Sociability is thus a world of make-believe, making the world of "outer" reality into a fantasyland that exists solely for the pleasure of the players. In the same vein, Simmel offers a perceptive analysis of the game of flirtation (which suggests that he must have been experienced at it—as do his knowledgeable remarks on love affairs and secrets). In its most refined form flirtation takes the raw material of sex and weaves from it a fabric of delight and fantasy, a symbolic world which turns the simplicity of physical passion into the subtle universe of love. By such sketches Simmel takes us into the heart of the salon society of Europe in one of its most dazzling eras. But Simmel never really pushes through to a sociological theory of the causes and effects of sociability or pursues the ramifications of his view of humankind's symbolic performances into a general model of society. He does not draw the implication, just recently being developed, that individuals create their worldviews out of just such encounters—not only in polite upper-bourgeois drawing rooms, but in all classes of society—and that it is just such shared fantasy worlds that bind some individuals together and set them off against others. Simmel's payoff is aesthetic rather than sociological. He concludes his discussion of sociability with the observation that polite conversation has the same sort of function as a majestic view of the 'Georg Simmel, The Sociology of Georg Simmel, Kurt H. Wolff, ed. Published in 1950 by The Free Press Division of the Macmillan Company. Reprinted by permission.</p>
<p class="calibre1">ocean: Both give pleasure because they transmute the turmoil of life into a pleasing spectacle, viewed from a distance. The tragedy of conflict and failure, of individual versus society, exists in sociability as in serious life, but as material for play, and hence no longer dangerous and uncontrolled. The conversationalist emerges victorious in his world of symbols. Simmel's sociology ranged much wider than drawing rooms, to include the serious realms of power, money, and historical change. As always, this material yields insights to Simmel's eye as he abstracts out the formal properties of diverse situations. His analyses of the effects of group size are classic, demonstrating that a group too large for all its members to converse together will have a different structure than a smaller one. The point is drawn even more sharply when he compares two-person groups with three-person groups. The dyad's fundamental reality is its perishability, for it will dissolve whenever one person decides to leave; this gives each partner a particular hold on the other. The triad, however, has a basic independence of its members, for it will still exist if one person leaves. The individual thus becomes less significant to the group. Moreover, new configurations open up here, as it becomes possible for two to form a coalition against the third, or one to play the other two off against each other. In short, the whole realm of organized society and its power relations opens up through shifts in numbers and in the resulting geometry of social relationships. Simmel thus develops the meaning of Thoreau's remark, "I have three chairs in my house: one for solitude, two for company, three for society." Simmel had other insights, some of them brilliant, on the structure of group conflicts, on the social relationships created by secrets, on the way in which the variety of groups in modern society gives each individual a distinctive set of social ties and hence produces modern individualism. But Simmel never really carried these ideas far enough to produce a comprehensive sociological theory. Unlike Durkheim, he does not try to test causal propositions against empirical evidence, but only to display a philosophy of the forms that flicker across the human landscape. At bottom, Simmel, the lonely outsider, hated society. He wrote that people in groups are ruled by the lowest common denominator and that the higher forms of intellect and morality are always individual products. This personal disposition contradicted Simmel's own insights on the ways in which the individual is a product of society, and it kept him from pressing on to the breakthroughs that came to Durkheim when he realized that people's moralities and ideas have their origins in groups and their rituals. But if Simmel, the outsider of the German intellectual world, could not produce a genuine sociology from the leads it offered, there were others who would. The American universities had been reformed in the 1870s and 1880s along German lines, and American intellectuals were shaking off the stupor of the era of petty religious colleges. American sociologists, full of the same German philosophy that sustained Simmel and impressed by the empirical approaches of the new experimental psychology, were to succeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">where Simmel failed. In Cooley and Mead, the relationship between the invisible world of social symbols and the mind of the individual was to become a theory of considerable power. THE LIFE AND WORK OF COOLEY Charles Horton Cooley (1864-1929) was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the fourth of six children. His father was a migrant from western New York, who had a distinguished career as a justice on Michigan's Supreme Court. Charles was an introspective, imaginative, and ambitious boy who read profusely. He prepared himself for college at age sixteen; however, ill health forced him to take seven years to graduate from the University of Michigan. Before taking his doctorate in economics in 1894, Cooley studied mechanical engineering, worked for the Interstate Commerce Commission, and traveled abroad. For his doctoral dissertation he presented a theory of transportation relating a socioeconomic solution of the railway question to the study of territorial demography. This work remains a benchmark in "human ecology," a field that was to be fruitfully researched and developed by Roderick McKenzie, Robert Park, and Ernest Burgess in Chicago a generation hence. Cooley's early inspiration came from Emerson, Goethe, and Darwin. From Herbert Spencer, whom he criticized subsequently for his subjectivity and lack of "culture," Cooley received his first broad outline of evolutionary knowledge. Franklin Giddings of Columbia University encouraged his aspirations to teach sociology as a university subject at Michigan. Cooley was a member of an academic clique that admired John Dewey, whose personality and lectures on political economy in 1893 and 1894 made a deep impression on Cooley's thought. Dewey criticized and went beyond Spencer by maintaining that society was an organism in a more profound way than the latter had perceived. Dewey's analysis of language as the "sensorium" of society corroborated Cooley's burgeoning interpretation of written language as the social medium of transmission par excellence. While preparing his thesis, Cooley became intrigued by the "psychic mechanism"; he was especially concerned with the transmission and modes of recording language through space and time. He studied these processes in their historical and contemporary forms until he developed a conception of communication that was consistent with his organic view of society. In his lectures and studies he continually related his findings to such major aspects of the social process as conflict, survival, and adaptation. Cooley transcended the Darwinian climate of opinion by becoming a social psychologist. He came to the realization that he could never actually see the social life of humankind unless he understood the processes of mind with which society was indissolubly linked. He observed the mental-social development of his children as a method of organizing and expanding his theoretical insights. After beginning to teach, he read Walter Bagehot, William</p>
<p class="calibre1">James, Gabriel Tarde, and Mark Baldwin and readied himself for his first book, in 1902, Human Nature and the Social Order. Cooley preferred a life of contemplation and continued to teach at his midwestern alma mater all his life. He turned down a professorship at Columbia, although he did consent reluctantly to serve as president of the American Sociological Society in 1918. COOLEY'S SYSTEM Cooley's social thought encompasses several interrelated dimensions: (1) His approach was organic; (2) his viewpoint was evolutionary; (3) his outlook was moral and progressive; and (4) his ideal was democratic. His organicism rested upon the theoretical assumption of the reciprocity of the individual and society. In his first book he systematically debunks the alleged antithesis of the individual versus society on the grounds that the latter is a psychical whole of which the individual is a particular expression. As the separate individual is a myth, so is society an illusion when conceived of apart from individual members. For Cooley "society" and "individuals" are collective and distributive aspects of the same thing rather than empirically separable phenomena. Thus, society becomes a living whole, or organism, composed of differentiated members, each of which has a special function. A university, for example, is composed of administrators, faculty, and students, with each status group having particular roles to perform within the organizational structure. This approach was a predecessor of the emerging functionalist system. Cooley's evolutionary viewpoint suffuses his system; yet it differs from the social evolutionism of Spencer and the leading nineteenth-century anthropologists in its emphasis on individual rather than collective aspects of development. Cooley is more concerned with the evolution of the individual's social being (how the growing organism acquires a sense of the "I") than with grand historical sequences or stages of cultural evolution. His view encourages the student of human nature to believe in life as a creative process of which the human will is an integral ingredient. Far from being a passive element of society, each individual does his or her unique share in the work of the common whole. Cooley perceived each individual as a "fresh organization of life," which flows from the hereditary and social past. He envisioned each life history as containing a stream and a road; he discerned the stream as heredity, which comes through the germ plasm. He apprehended the road as "communication or social transmission," including language, interaction, and education. The road, which contemporary sociologists might call "culture," is a later development than the stream. Cooley's moral outlook is expressed in his equation of rationality with the judgment of right. By rationality Cooley meant more than the product of formal reasoning; he pointed to the more profound rationality of conscience as an outcome of the social life of a person, including one's interac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions with others and imaginary conversations with oneself. By locating society in the mind, Cooley, in his ethical treatise "The Social Aspect of Conscience," was able to explain the moral nature of confession as the opening of oneself to another, higher, more ideal person from whose vantage point one is able to obtain an outside view of oneself. Cooley's morality was thus rational, social, and progressive. While he did not feel, like some ethnocentric evolutionists, that twentieth-century culture was the apex of civilization, he did believe in the necessity for humankind to have a high and vivid image of personality that was morally edifying. One's reach, so to speak, should exceed one's grasp. He discerned three practically universal ideas of right: loyalty to the group, kindness to group members, and adherence to the customs of the tribe. Whereas his contemporary, Max Weber, understood the rationalization of the world in terms of continual disenchantment (for example, the recent demystification of the moon), Cooley stressed the possibilities for personal growth in a right (that is, rational) society efficiently organized according to democratic principles. His conception of democracy embodied a philosophy of mind-enlarging consciousness. Cooley found the earliest forms of democratic unity in Western civilization among the pre-Roman Teutonic tribes, especially in the social units of the family, clan, and village group. Without indirect communications media such as the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television, people had to come together in face-to-face contact to experience the rising tide of social excitement that led to higher levels of consciousness. The people of old held feasts, games, and public assemblies and ceremonies as occasions for group exaltation and as opportunities for the expression of public opinion. Modern-day Americans celebrate the astronauts' space flights through the mass medium of television; the Romans fed Christians to the lions in stone stadiums; and the ancients chanted, sang, and danced festively around the campfire. Rock concerts and jazz, gospel, and country festivals are contemporary examples of a return to primitive modes of togetherness, with the added thrill of amplified sound made possible by recent technological and cultural developments. Cooley stated that although "democracy as a spirit is spontaneous," it could only have a large-scale spiritual effect with the liberation of the creative faculties of the members composing the body politic. He saw in the present epoch the potentiality for a "higher and freer consciousness" and understood democracy as the general phase of that enlarged consciousness. Cooley comprehended institutions as definite and established products of the public mind which were the outcomes of the organization and crystallization of thought around the forms of customs, symbols, beliefs, and lasting sentiments. He perceived such institutions as language, the family, industry, education, religion, and law as continually responsive to the needs of human nature. He saw them as "apperceptive systems" of the public mind, which were inseparable from, and unreal without relation to, one another. Here again one can notice glimmerings of functionalism; Cooley, however, did not make the mistake of reifying the social system</p>
<p class="calibre1">and locating needs in it rather than in the people who created it. Since sociality is mental, the institution is an individual habit of mind that is largely unconscious because of its commonality. The individual is not merely a passive effect of the social order; he or she is an effective cause as well. The Looking-Glass Self and the Primary Group In Human Nature and the Social Order Cooley presents his theory of the social self. Drawing upon Wilhelm Wundt and especially upon William James, he discusses the meaning of the "I" as observed in daily thought and speech. This "I" is the empirical self that can be verified by observation; it is neither an a priori Cartesian assumption nor a metaphysical entity. Cooley observed that this primal idea referred least often to the body and most often to either the "my feeling" or to the "looking-glass self." He regarded the self as a feeling state that is more or less consistent with ideas as they arise in our experience. The former "my" attitude refers to the individual's sense of appropriation toward various objects and people. He gives the example of gloating as a reflective self-feeling state in which the person who has either accomplished or acquired something that is pleasing thinks "mine, mine, mine" with a warm sensation. Cooley extends James's definition of psychology as the study of states of consciousness by establishing the sociality of selfhood as it relates to the thought of others. The social self emerges as an idea taken from the communicative life that the mind treasures as its own. It was from this line of reasoning that the concept of the looking-glass self was born. In order to grasp this germinal idea, one should bear in mind Cooley's dictum: "The imaginations people have of one another are the solid facts of society." The dimensions of the looking-glass self are threefold: First, we imagine our appearance or image in the eyes of the other; second, we imagine some judgment of that appearance; and finally, we experience some sort of self-feeling such as pride or mortification. In other words, "I feel about me the way I think you think of me." For example, a person would be ashamed to appear ignorant in the presence of a learned man, or glad to be recognized by a celebrity. This phenomenon pervades our everyday existence in the social arena at even subtler levels than shame or joy. All the little looks and gestures that happen in daily encounters with others constitute the very fabric of society. This aspect of Cooley's sociology has been developed in the social thought of Erving Goffman, a man whom we shall meet in a later chapter. In Cooley's primary theory of social psychology, that we are the imaginations that we have of one another, and that society is the organic whole of which all imagining individuals are parts, he asserted that these imaginations are the solid facts of society. In the relation of self to society, individuals project images of their selves, which, as James said, are basically of the modes of self-denial or self-affirmation. From the latter group come the stars in the institution of entertainment (or "show business"). The star sys-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tern represents a stratification of social selves—from the "superstars" to the less famous—in relation to the nonstars—viewers, audience, fans, or public. The old adage that stars are born and not made may be true; however, the promotion of the social self of a star is the secondary function of an effective agent with the right business connections and contacts in the industry as well as the charisma of the performer. The decline of the hero in our times has given rise in mass society to the phenomenon of the celebrity, a manufactured personality with or without talent. The celebrity's image is sold to the collectivity through advertising in the media (especially television, movies, radio, newspapers, and magazines). The Hollywood-derived star image is an economic commodity competing with other marketable image-commodities of packaged personalities. Perceptive commentators on America have observed that we, and many of the other high-tech countries, are living in the era of the cult of the personality. Movies are to the twentieth century what oil paintings were to the nineteenth, and such legends as Al Jolson, Maurice Chevalier, Jimmy Durante, Bette Davis, John Wayne, Jack Benny, Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Charlie Chaplin, Noel Coward, Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe took time and space to magnify themselves in our imaginations. As the movies are replaced by television as the primary entertainment medium, the marketplace of the star system shifts from the public place of the theater to the private locale of the home. Since advertising remains a constant factor of American society, the star system maintains itself in a modified form. Still, the mind, in which the stars themselves exist, remains the locus of society in the Cooleyan framework. Hollywood has been the dream factory and the center of Romantic America. As the scene switches more to television, "TV Guide" has become the log of that civilization. And now we are entering a new era in the evolution of communications, as well as a transition from one electronic source-dyad of the definition of "reality"—the movies and radio—to another—television and the computer. In Social Organization (1909) Cooley introduced the concept of the primary group. Such an association is characterized by intimacy, face-to-face interaction, emotional warmth, and cooperation. These groups are the seedbeds of society in the sense that they are fundamental in forming the social nature of the individual and his or her primary ideals, including love, freedom, and justice. The outcome of a primary relationship involves a "we" feeling that makes for close identification of the self with the life of the group. Sociologically universal examples of this mode of association are the children's play group, the family, the neighborhood, and the council of elders. The basic experience of the primary group is the feeling of social unity with other members. In contemporary times primary groups have been emerging in the form of urban and rural communes, as people begin to band together with varying degrees of success for survival purposes and to reexperience a lost or shattered home life. For Cooley the self-governing, democratic village commune was the highest social form. He quotes</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tocqueville: "It is man who makes monarchies and establishes republics, but the commune seems to come directly from the hand of God." In contrast to the primary group the secondary group is impersonal, contractual, formal, and rational. Relationships are cool rather than warm. Professional associations, corporate bureaucracies, and nation-states are classic examples of this group type. But primary and secondary groups should not be taken as mutually exclusive categories. For example, primary groups may emerge within the secondary bureaucracies in the forms of boards of directors, academic cliques, circles of confidants, and like-minded associations. CRITICISM OF COOLEY Cooley's methodology was one of "sympathetic introspection." By this he meant the process of the social scientist putting himself or herself in touch with various sorts of persons, attempting to imagine how the world appears to them, and then recollecting and describing as closely as possible their particular feeling states. By this method Cooley essayed to understand the inner lives of rich and poor, criminals and children, conservatives and radicals, idiots and idealists. No phase of human nature was alien to him, so deep and wide were his sympathies. He took his own nature as a reflecting prism of the whole, and by examining his responses to others' presentations of self, he sought to pierce the invisible veil of society. Since Cooley's methodology was analogous to Max Weber's verstehen and Pitirim Sorokin's "logico-meaningful" method, it may be criticized on similar grounds. A major canon of scientific method is that its statements must be intersubjectively testable; otherwise, reliability of results becomes impossible. Indeed, one of the scientific dilemmas of Western sociology has been the immense difficulty of agreeing upon uniform methods and procedures. Since Cooley depended primarily on his personal powers of observation and drew his insights by an imaginative reconstruction of society from his peculiar vantage point, there would be no way for objective social scientists to test his conclusions empirically. Mead himself took Cooley to task for locating society in the mind instead of in the social world out of which psychical experiences arise. However, Cooley was breaking new ground by locating the self in consciousness rather than in behavior and therefore felt free to unload his mind of positivist baggage. Methodological precision concerned him far less than breadth of comprehension. Cooley was a sanguine practitioner, whose small-town sociology is suffused with the mores and attitudes of midwestern, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant liberalism. Cooley spent most of his life with his family and in the academic cloister at Ann Arbor, preferring not to venture into the flow of surrounding society. The prime advantages of this sheltered existence were the opportunities to meditate calmly and deeply on the quality of social life and to consolidate an expanding sociology department at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">University of Michigan. The main disadvantage was Cooley's failure to come into direct or frequent contact with people of diverse modes of life. He understood the problems of social organization in terms of personal degeneracy; his analysis, while penetrating, was more speculative than empirical. His uplifting armchair sociology rings with a kind of idealization of the real, which disdained the painstaking task of data gathering. Unlike Freud, Cooley was relatively out of touch with the world of unconscious wishes and motives. Cooley accepted Goethe's notion of the individual as a unified whole and rejected both biological and psychological determinism. The underlying theme of Cooley's theory of self was the metaphor of growth. His faith was in the individual's untapped potentialities, or what Dewey called "the infinite perfectability of man." Cooleyan sociology was a rationalistic blend of the provincial and the universal. The former attitude was a reflection of an isolationist America that had yet to be swept onto the international scene by a world war, while the latter pointed to the essentially Christian foundations of American civilization and the subsequent emergence of the national drive to "make the world safe for democracy." THE LIFE AND WORK OF MEAD George Herbert Mead (1863-1931) was born in South Hadley, Massachusetts, the son of a pastor. He studied at Harvard under the tutorship of Josiah Royce and William James. He traveled widely and took courses at overseas universities, mainly in Germany. In 1893 he was awarded a recently founded chair in philosophy at the University of Chicago, where John Dewey became a colleague and personal friend. Mead taught there until his death in 1931. He exercised a tremendous influence on several generations of students, principally through his oral teaching; his publications during his life consisted of scattered articles, notes, and critical studies in various philosophical, psychological, sociological, and pedagogical journals. All those who knew Mead personally were unanimous in remembering him as a rare, high, and disinterested spirit. He was a professor who knew how to charm as well as interest his students. He had a manner well suited to the exposition of ideas; he reasoned in a spiral by returning to what he had already said and then integrating it at a higher level of understanding. He made a new point with each line of reasoning, weaving previous threads into a larger and more comprehensive fabric of thought. Colleagues and students admitted, moreover, that conversation was his medium; writing was a poor second best. Despite the pressure of the academic world to "publish or perish," Mead became chairman of the University of Chicago's philosophy department without having published a single book. Four volumes of lecture notes gathered by pupils and friends were issued posthumously under the titles of The Philosophy of the Present (1932), Mind, Self, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Society (1934), Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century (1936), and The Philosophy of the Act (1938). Like Georg Simmel, he was a philosopher turned social scientist, and in order to get a clearer portrait of Mead's social psychology within the history of sociological theory it helps to consider his philosophical perspective. MEAD'S SYSTEM Mead's social thought is relational, evolutionary, and pragmatic. Upon reading Mead one is struck with a sense of what Alfred North Whitehead called "the interrelatedness of things." As a philosopher of science Mead understood the mechanical and atomistic bias of the nineteenth century as an outcome of past systems of ideas. The chemists and physicists of the preceding century were mainly preoccupied with the notion of matter as composed of static, solid, self-sufficient particles. Their focus was on the structure rather than on the activities of the atom. With the recent emergence of relativistic theories in the natural sciences, atoms were perceived in terms of "eigen states" or "patterns of stability." This shift in emphasis, which provided a wider theoretical frame of reference for explaining physical events, was paralleled in Mead's social psychology by the dissolution of the implicitly atomistic image of humankind of much nineteenth-century sociology. The sociologies of Comte, Marx, Spencer, and even Durkheim apprehended the relationship between society and the individual primarily in a deterministic manner. The locus for action resided almost wholly in the social or economic system such that "the invisible hand of society" totally controlled human behavior. The human individual was portrayed as a kind of self-contained molecule within the larger social organism. Mead's rela- tionism consisted of his theoretical joining of self and society in the ongoing social process such that the individual was neither isolated from his or her fellows nor wholly determined by any abstract system. Mead's theoretical achievement was arrived at inductively by observation of what happens in the daily lives of human beings. For Mead the society in which we interact with one another in sundry groups constitutes an empirical reality. It is a product of evolution and is divisible into many modes of social reality, which are dependent upon variable definitions of the situation. He distinguished between Aristotelian and Darwinian ideas of evolution; according to the former doctrine, evolution is the development of the existing plant or animal species (which is the Latin word for the Greek term "form") without reference to the environment. In contrast, the theory presented in Darwin's Origin of Species is not concerned with the development of a particular species as such; rather, it is interested in showing how various forms evolve and survive in response to environmental pressures. Those forms survive that can best adapt themselves to changing life conditions. Behind this post-Aristotelian conception is the idea of a life pro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cess that takes on various forms (or species), which arise and decline through space and time. The human form is a relatively recent evolutionary development. It was the German romantic idealists, culminating with Hegel, who formulated a philosophy relevant to the human life form in terms of the reflexive experience of ourselves as actors in the social world. According to this tradition the self is not a static unity that exists in vacuo; it is a dynamic, historical process that involves a subject-object relationship and arises as a result of interaction with other selves. The more we become aware of ourselves in the continuing social process, the more we increase our "species consciousness." In other words, we become more able to understand our human form as a consequence of life and social processes. As a pragmatist philosopher Mead is heir to James and Dewey. Mead viewed modern research science, with its mathematical and experimental methods, as both a cultural outgrowth of the European Renaissance and Enlightenment and an emergent evolutionary tool whereby humans might intelligently control their social institutions. He was in agreement with Dewey that scientific method applied to the problems of society was the key to the door of progress. Mead interpreted pragmatist doctrine as having three phases and two primary sources. The former included the following assumptions: (1) that a hypothesis is "true" if it works when tested, (2) that the process of knowing lies within human conduct, and (3) that knowledge is a process of acquiring the necessary "scientific apparatus" (including ideas, concepts, units of analysis, theoretical models, paradigms, equations, and so forth) to carry out the desirable task of social reconstruction in a democratic state. He understood the sources of pragmatism to be (1) behavioristic psychology, which enables the social scientist to apprehend intelligence in terms of human activity, and (2) the process of research or scientific method, which is self-revising and tests an hypothesis by how it works. Mead recognized the French Revolution as the pivot of modern history; it built the principle of revolution into social institutions by incorporating the people's right to change or amend the constitution upon which the state is founded. The fundamental scientific problem that emerged in Mead's mind, then, was how we become selves in a rapidly changing and seemingly chaotic world. How to preserve order and at the same time accommodate change was Mead's perennial question. The Social Self That the human being has a self is the major supposition of Mead's theoretical framework. It is no mystical conjuration but an empirical exercise to observe that human beings make indications to themselves in the course of everyday life. Mead defined these "self-indications" as anything of which one is conscious, such as a ringing telephone, a friend's remark, the lyrics of a song, a thought, the recognition of a familiar figure, and so forth. The im-</p>
<p class="calibre1">portance of discerning the existence of these self-indications is twofold: (1) An object (physical, abstract, or social) may be extricated from its setting and acted upon; and (2) the fact of human self-indication enables the individual's action to be constructed rather than simply released. Mead distinguished between the stimulus and the object. The former does not have an intrinsic character that acts upon individuals. In contrast, the meaning of the object is conferred upon it by the individual. Human beings react to a stimulus (for instance, an unexpected pin prick), but they act toward an object (for example, the determination not to flinch at an injection). Individuals are not surrounded by a world of preexisting objects that coerce them; rather, they build up their environment of objects according to their ongoing activities. From a myriad of prosaic everyday acts, such as getting dressed or preparing food, to major life decisions, such as choice of vocation or mate, the individual is making self-notations of objects, assigning them meaning, assessing their utility in reaching various goals, and then deciding what to do on the basis of such judgments. Mead understood this interpretive or self-conversational process as acting on a symbolic basis. Mead made fuller sense of Dewey's notion of language as the sensorium of society by delving into the symbolic processes of human communication. He distinguished between gesture and symbol, deriving his concept of the former from Wundt's Volkerpsychologie and from Darwin's psychological classic The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. By the term "gesture" Mead meant a social act that operates as a stimulus for the response of another form engaged in the same act. He presents as an example of a "conversation of gestures" the dogfight, in which the forms interact with one another on a nonsymbolic basis by growling, baring the teeth, and nipping the flanks. In such a situation each dog does not stop to ascertain the meaning of the other's aggressive behavior. One dog's response of growling to the other's baring of teeth is not made on the basis of what that gesture stands for. The first dog does not respond to the meaning of the second dog's gesture, because it does not indicate to itself the hostile intentions of that gesture. The adjustive behavior (that is, the ensuing fight) is called forth by the character of the stimulation, without any intermediary process of interpretation of meaning. Human beings respond not to the gesture but to its meaning; thus, human language or communication is symbolically interactive. Take, for example, the baseball situation of "at bat." The pitcher peers down from the mound to receive the signal from the catcher as to what type of pitch to throw, while the batter checks with the third-base coach for hitting instructions relayed from the manager in the dugout. The catcher may indicate a curve ball by extending, say, two fingers, and the third-base coach may order a bunt by touching his ear and tipping his cap. Thus, before the delivery of the pitch, the situation has been structured according to prearranged signal systems, which have a common meaning (that is, evoke similar responses) for the actors involved. That the pitcher has the option of calling for another pitch and that the batter might be guessing that a curve will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">thrown mean that the players are not merely reacting like dogs to gestures; they are interpreting symbolically the meaning of the signs, thereby organizing their activity to act intelligently toward the situation confronting them. When the gesture evokes the same attitude in the receiving as well as the sending form, it is a significant symbol. When the bodily or vocal gesture (speech) reaches that stage, it has become what we call "language." What enables human beings to interact meaningfully (that is, symbolically) with one another in the ongoing social process is the primary mechanism of role taking. As human beings become objects to themselves and learn to act toward themselves in various ways, they also learn to assume the roles of others in constructing their behavior. They learn to cast themselves imaginatively into the other person's frame of reference and to assume an attitude toward themselves that reflects this sympathetic understanding. For example, a parole-board officer attempts to ascertain the prisoner's fitness for parole on the basis of his moral and sympathetic judgment of the prisoner's current attitude toward the law. The self is reflexive in the sense that it coils back upon itself in the communicative process, and it is social in the sense that it is built up continually in the course of daily encounters with other human beings. The social self is a product of a series of defining situations which arise in the life of the individual. In addition, the social self is an emergent process within society, which Mead construes as the fitting together of individual lines of action in human groups via role taking. The social self is neither a static intellectual monad like Descartes' cerebral "I" nor a defense structure such as Freud's executive "ego"; rather, it is a dynamic and changing transaction between the individual and others. Mead described the contents of the social self in terms of "I" and "me" aspects. The conception of the self as binary rather than unitary was mentioned by James and developed by Cooley, but it found its fullest expression in Mead. Mead understood that the social act itself is phasic in that the human being delays his or her action toward other forms. In preparing the act, the individual can consider the possible responses of the other in lieu of reacting wholly on impulse. Furthermore, the self that organizes its behavior within the social act in relation to other forms is composed of conditioned and spontaneous phases. Mead identifies the former as the "me" and the latter as the "I." The "me" represents the organized set of group attitudes that the member assumes. It is the conventional, habitual, and routinized aspect of self that is always there. The "me" determines our self-consciousness insofar as we are able to take the role of others within the larger community of selves. Each member of a choir, for example, knows the score he or she is supposed to sing, and the resulting harmony of sound is a product of cooperation among the sopranos, tenors, and basses. The "I" stands for the response of the individual to the organized attitudes of others. It is aware of the social "me" in the sense that the "I" of one moment is present in the "me" of the next. In other words, the "now" or what Mead called "the present" is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sphere of the "I," while the "me" consists of the organization of past attitudes. Mead's "I" accounts for such phenomena as novelty, spontaneity, artistic creativity, and social change in relation to social situations, which function as occasions for the emergence of a creative self. The "I" as construed by Mead is the sociological analogue to Werner Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle in physics. Mead's formulation cracks the ideological edifice of determinism by allowing for the element of chance or free will in human affairs. Mead developed an original theory of social change from the "I" concept. He understood institutions as social habits that are necessary for the maintenance and preservation of social order. Social control rests ultimately on the exercise of self-control, whereby the individual feels inwardly obliged to respect the rights of others within the community. This relationship of the individual to society becomes highlighted when persons of great mind and moral character emerge and make the wider society a different one. A genius's behavior is as socially conditioned as that of the ordinary person, with the exception that the genius's response to the organized attitude of the group is unique and original. Einstein, for example, lived a relatively simple life; however, his response to physics' universe of discourse was such that the consequences of his theoretical synthesis changed society at large. The lives of such world teachers as Jesus, Buddha, and Socrates are symbolic in the sense that their personal relationships represented an emergent order that was implicit in the institutions of their respective communities. They were deviant with respect to particular public moralities, but conformist in giving complete expression to such central principles of the larger community as rationality, neighborliness, truthfulness, and brotherly love. They were manifestations, so to speak, of higher beings, who, as religious personages and as charismatic leaders endowed by their publics with spiritual authority, approached the social realm from the standpoint of the spiritual plane and were enabled thereby to effect major social change. The Generalized Other Mead's second major contribution to sociological theory was the concept of the "generalized other." In the growth and development of the self the generalized other represents the stage at which the individual is finally able to relate to himself or herself according to the attitude of the whole community. Prior stages in the genesis of this truly social self are the preplay, play, and game stages. In the earliest phase of self-genesis the child's baby talk is a reflection of its inability to make an object of itself through which it can approach itself. Mead objected to Tarde's theory of direct imitation because it failed to explain the manner in which individuals learn to make objects of themselves, a process that is inherent in the evolution of human selfhood. During the play stage of socialization, children assume roles segmental- ly and arbitrarily. They play in a quasi-theatrical way at being mother, father, doctor, television star, or astronaut. During this interval children have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a rich fantasy life and begin to take on roles in a rudimentary manner by assuming the vague personalities that populate their minds as a result of the McLuhanesque environment in which they dwell—a mass communications environment, which has become increasingly electrified since Mead's day. The successive radio and television generations of American youth have derived their symbolic worlds and their role models increasingly from the entertainment media, including comic books, movies, and record albums, rather than from literature or personal contact. The mind begins to develop during this formative stage as the child stimulates its imagination by assuming inwardly the attitudes of its heroes. In the game stage, the child no longer assumes the attitude of particular individuals toward itself; it ceases taking discrete roles. The child who plays in a game must be ready to take the attitude of everyone else involved in that game and needs to understand how the different social roles are interrelated. The child is confronted by the ongoing activity of others, which is organized and has procedural rules. To grasp the group in terms of its activity is essential. The child learns the rules of the game not by rote acquisition, but in anticipating how others are going to act in the game situation and then adjusting its behavior toward their lines of action and building up its own. According to the framework of symbolic interactionism, learning includes role playing in a situation where the social self arises in the ongoing group process. The final stage of self-development, according to the Meadian schema, is the generalized other. This concept parallels Durkheim's idea of the collective conscience and Freud's formulation of the cultural superego. What is significant about this phase is that the individual has transcended rule-following behavior by becoming conscious of his or her realization of the rules. This ability of making an object of one's consciousness, of one's own process of self-indication, enables the human being to take an abstract role, which stands for a series of concrete roles. For example, the president of an organization assumes an abstract role insofar as she is aware of the particular roles that constitute the status network of the hierarchy. Other instances of such complex roles would be those of the peace negotiator, political ambassador, labor arbitrator, football coach, United Nations representative, and presidential "troubleshooter." In each case the individual must be aware of invisible, informal webs of personal relationships in addition to the organizational loyalties of the involved social actors. Mead identified the generalized other with the organized community or social group that gives the individual his or her sense of self-unity. The generalized other entails the extension of role taking into continuously expanding social circles, from the Cooleyan primary groups to such secondary associations as the workers' union, the university, the corporation, the political party, and the nation-state. The whole community, from the small group to the giant bureaucracy, can express an attitude only because it is represented in each individual's mind as the attitude of the generalized other. As the size of Spaceship Earth shrinks with technological progress in</p>
<p class="calibre1">transportation and communication, a global consciousness begins to emerge in minds around the world. To Mead and those who follow him in his train of thought, the League of Nations and the United Nations appear as attempts to institutionalize a planetary generalized other in order to resolve national conflicts of interests by mediation and mutual understanding rather than by war. The generalized other is an idea of high explanatory power which has had considerable influence in the formulation of empirical social research. Herbert Hyman's derivative concept of the "reference group" has become one of the central analytic tools in social psychology. Robert K. Merton and Alice S. Rossi interpreted it in terms of a "social frame of reference" while analyzing the causes of varying degrees of dissatisfaction among World War II troops. Muzafer Sherif employed related concepts in experimental studies of individual conformity to group judgments. Further implications of the concept of the generalized other remain to be explored by future generations of social psychologists. CRITICISMS AND ASSESSMENTS OF MEAD A major defect of Mead's sociology is its failure to account for the phenomena of power and stratification. Since he was more concerned with developing a social psychology in which the whole (society) is prior to the part (individual) and with describing the complex process by which the biologic individual acquires a self in the social process, Mead tended to ignore the ways in which humans dominate and manipulate one another in political, economic, and status hierarchies. His approach to society was discursive rather than rigorously structural, and his schema neglected to analyze social class and mobility. Although his philosophy was relatively apolitical, it did reflect an underlying liberal ideology of self-improvement through personal change. A radical element of Mead's thought that has not been fully appreciated is his theory of the social consequences of personal change. Another problem with Mead's theory is the difficulty of operationaliz- ing his concepts for research purposes. Such notions as the "I" and the "me" and the "generalized other" are too vague to quantify in an era when hard research is measured by elaborate indices, matrices, and tests of statistical significance. Since Mead's universe of discourse lends itself neither to the data-accounting approach to sociology nor to a calculus of theoretical propositions, his social psychology is sometimes regarded as useless for social research. But the argument may also be reversed. Mead's relational perspective contains a covert critique of positivistic sociology. This critique has been most succinctly stated by Herbert Blumer, one of Mead's former pupils at the University of Chicago. According to Blumer the fundamental deficiency in contemporary sociology is that it operates with unrealistic images of human beings. Humankind is not merely a medium through which beliefs,</p>
<p class="calibre1">values, norms, and roles work themselves out in behavior; the human being is an acting agent who takes these matters into account in constructing his or her behavior vis-a-vis the situations in which he or she acts. To be faithful to the character of human group life, it is necessary to recognize human beings as acting organisms organizing their own activity, rather than as neutral entities pushed into action by forces allegedly working through them. For Blumer the trend in contemporary sociology is to remove sociologists from intimate familiarity with the life and experience of people in society. To the extent that this occurs, they become naiive about the world they propose to study and accept abstract theoretical constructions or answers to a few short survey questions as a sufficient contact with empirical reality. The Meadians thus turn the tables on their positivistic detractors. As we shall see in Chapter 13, developments in social phenomenology have opened up the possibility of closing the gap between the two perspectives, of bringing about a close analysis of subjective experience as the foundation for more arm's-length research methods. Finally, Mead may be criticized for being naiive in his equation of process with progress. He stressed consciousness and rationality, while paying little attention to the unconscious and irrationality. Indeed, for Mead the Freudian unconscious was a chimera, since whatever people fail to indicate to themselves are things of which they are unaware. Mead's optimism wears a bit thin in view of the violent holocaust that unfolded after his demise. However, one must remember that Mead was at bottom an ethical philosopher, who, like Durkheim toward the end of his career, was struggling to enunciate what he called a "method of morality." In essays collected under the title Fragments on Ethics Mead portrayed humans as rational beings, because they are social beings. By analyzing the philosophies of Kant and the utilitarians he arrived at a pragmatic position according to which the only rule ethics can present is that an individual should deal rationally with all the values that are found in a particular problem. Mead's analogue of the Golden Rule was to "act toward other people as you want them to act toward you under the same conditions." His method of morality would take into account the combined and interrelated interests of the individual and society.</p>

<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER TEN The Discovery of the Ordinary World: Thomas, Park, and the Chicago School; W.E.B. DuBois and African- American Sociology The year 1918 marked the beginning of a new era in American sociology. It saw not only the end of World War I, the coming of women's suffrage, and the decisive dominance of a new urban America, but also the publication of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America by William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki. This five-volume work, running to 2,244 pages, was a monument in more ways than one, for it represented the first major American effort to win attention by bringing together general sociological theory with large-scale empirical research. The age of systematic sociological research had just begun. For its first few decades, such research had a very well marked home. It was the University of Chicago, from whose medieval stone walls and picturesque courtyards the sociologists of the "Chicago school" sallied forth to investigate the surrounding urban slum. The university enjoyed an intellectual position during the first half of the twentieth century rivaled only by Harvard; Enrico Fermi's cracking of the atom and Robert Hutchins' famous educational reforms were only some of its better-known accomplishments. Founded in 1892 on John D. Rockefeller's millions, Chicago sought preeminence from the very beginning. Its first faculty consisted of many of the top thinkers in America, pirated away from rival institutions by Chicago's dynamic president, William Rainey Harper. The first department of sociology in the world was set up there at its outset, under the chairmanship of Albion W. Small, who had come directly from the presidency of Colby College in Maine. 187</p>
<p class="calibre1">THOMAS'S LIFE AND WORKS William I. Thomas (1863-1947) was one of the first graduate students in the sociology department. He was already in his thirties, having previously taken a Ph.D. in English, held a professorship at Oberlin College, and studied philology and ethnology in Germany. Within a year after appearing at Chicago, he had a position on the faculty. Although he was the son of a rural southern preacher, Thomas became very much the sophisticated ur- banite and bon vivant. Known as a snappy dresser and a lady charmer, Thomas eventually talked a wealthy Chicago heiress into putting up $50,000 for the study of race relations. This was quite a sum for its day (1908) and indeed constituted the first big research grant in the history of American social research. With this money Thomas embarked on a study of Polish immigrants in Chicago. He originally intended to study other ethnic and racial groups as well, but his sense of empirical thoroughness led him to limit his focus. The Poles, as the biggest immigrant minority in Chicago at the time, posed an important enough question in themselves, especially since the Chicago newspapers were currently full of alarm about "Polish crime": the unpredictable outburst of violence from otherwise stolid and acquiescent people. Thomas, who had fully immersed himself in the social thought of his day (see Chapter 5), was already critical of simple evolutionist or racist theories of behavior. He expected that neither automatic modernization nor hereditarily determined failure would be the fate of these transplanted Polish peasants, and his research was designed to find out exactly what was happening. Thomas drew for his approach on the latest developments in social psychology, especially the dynamic outlook of James and Mead. Social life must be seen from the inside, as people actually experience it, Thomas felt. Social structures operate on individuals only as the individuals interpret them and feel them bearing down against their own attitudes and motivations. He later formulated a key element of the symbolic interaction- ist approach in the statement that has since become known as the "Thomas Theorem": "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences." In accordance with this methodology Thomas learned Polish, read the local immigrant press, and observed daily life in the Polish ghetto. His most famous methodological innovation was the use of letters that Polish immigrants had written to relatives at home. Thomas hit on this method fortuitously. One day, walking through the ghetto, he jumped back quickly to avoid a bundle of garbage thrown out of a window. In the pile of garbage he spied a pack of letters. Since he could read Polish, he looked through them and found a vivid account of immigrant life "from the inside." Subsequently, Thomas advertised in the Polish press for other collections of letters and used these as a major part of his documentary materials. In 1913, while on a trip to Poland, Thomas met Florian Znaniecki (pro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">nounced Znan-yet-ski), a young Polish philosopher, and they discussed Thomas's work. The next year the Germans invaded Poland and Znaniecki escaped to America. Completely unanticipated and uninvited, he showed up penniless at Thomas's house in Chicago. Thomas took him in and made him a collaborator in his research, especially in filling in the background on the peasants in Poland. The completed work, which began appearing in 1918, had an immediate impact, at least within sociology. It established the superiority of large- scale systematic research over speculative and superficial approaches, and it at last brought theoretical issues down to where they belong—in confrontation with the real world. The Polish Peasant concluded, among other things, that crime was the result of the lack of mediating institutions to integrate the individual into the larger society. Accordingly, a strong Polish- language press, Polish parishes of the Catholic Church, and other immigrant cultural institutions were far from being alien and dangerous to the fabric of American society. On the contrary, Thomas and Znaniecki argued, it was just such institutions that integrated the Polish community around itself and hence provided the prerequisites for its eventual integration into the rest of society. Thomas and Znaniecki thus avoided the naive positions—condemning the immigrants or demanding their immediate Americanization—and gave a more sophisticated analysis based on careful observation of the facts. Their work can be faulted, especially for its neglect of politics, but in general their view holds true and bears considerable relevance to the experience of other minority groups, including the black minority of today. But, at the very moment of his triumph, Thomas's career had a sudden shock. Early in 1918 he was arrested by the F.B.I, in a hotel room with a Mrs. Granger, the wife of an army officer on duty in France. The charges—violating the Mann Act and registering in a hotel under a false name—were thrown out of court, but there was a great public scandal. The arrest appears to have been politically motivated, since Thomas's wife was currently prominent in Henry Ford's peace movement, then anathema to the Woodrow Wilson administration. The University of Chicago, under an onslaught of unfavorable publicity from the Chicago Tribune and similar quarters, abruptly dismissed Thomas. There was scarcely a protest from the faculty; for all his eminence, Thomas had enemies. Thomas spent the rest of his career traveling and writing under grants from the Carnegie Corporation, the Social Science Research Council, and various wealthy heiresses. Except in the flashiness of his life style, Thomas might well be called the first sociologist of the modern era of research grantsmanship. Znaniecki went on to become a theorist of some note. Ironically, with its founding spirit in exile, the Chicago school emerged in the 1920s as a full-blown movement in sociology. Its new leader was, appropriately enough, a protege of Thomas, Robert E. Park (1864-1944).</p>
<p class="calibre1">PARK AND THE CHICAGO SCHOOL Park, too, had had a colorful nonacademic career. He also had come from a religious, rural family. He studied philosophy with John Dewey at the University of Michigan and with William James at Harvard, and in between he spent twelve years as a newspaper reporter, based from New York and Detroit to Denver, Minneapolis, and Chicago. Like most other intellectually oriented Americans, he put in his sojourn in Germany, where he encountered Simmel and earned a Ph.D. from Heidelberg in 1904. Park then became secretary of the Congo Reform Association and wrote a famous expose of the barbaric conditions prevailing in the colonial regime of the Belgian Congo. The racial situation in America attracted him next, and Park became a ghost writer and adviser to the black leader Booker T. Washington. Indeed, it has been urged that Park was the "power behind the throne" in Washington's movement. In any case it seems fair to say that the two men shared the same gradual, assimilationist, up-by-your-own-bootstraps philosophy of change. It was at Washington's Tuskegee Institute in Alabama that William Thomas discovered Park in 1914 and brought him to Chicago. After 1918, with Thomas gone from the scene, Park took over the leadership of the Chicago school. The ex-newspaperman gave the group just the impetus that was needed. The growing city was the big story of the day, Park exhorted, and he sent his students out to find "the big sociological news" in the everyday world around them. Before the 1920s were over, the Chicago school had produced a series of studies such as Nels Anderson's The Hobo (1923), Frederick M. Thrasher's The Delinquent Gang (1927), Louis Wirth's The Ghetto (1928), and Harvey W. Zorbaugh's The Gold Coast and the Slum (1929). Park himself, with hij; colleagues Ernest W. Burgess and Roderick D. McKenzie, produced an overall picture of the city, with a perspective derived from animal ecology. Although their model may have been unduly shaped by Chicago's position on the shores of Lake Michigan, it gave an elegant picture of the city as a set of concentric rings: a downtown core where the very rich and the very poor lived nearby (if in drastically different conditions), surrounded by neighborhoods beginning with slums and becoming progressively better as one reached the suburbs. As the city grew and new immigrants arrived, the best-off inhabitants moved to the outskirts. Their previous places became filled by the more prosperous members of the next inner ring, who in turn vacated spaces for the ring inside them, and so on until we reach the center, where the newest immigrant groups found the poorest places from which to begin. This model of ecological succession was elaborated theoretically in several ways. In the 1930s resiearchers began to map rates of suicide, mental illness, crime, and other forms of deviance onto such ecological diagrams and found they were concentrated in certain areas of the city. These were called "disorganized" areas and were believed to generate deviance. Another vari-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ation was Park's famous "race-relations cycle," which bears a metaphorical as well as a substantive relation to his ecological model. All groups, claimed Park, struggle for domination of available resources, both economic and territorial. After initial contact between alien groups, there is conflict. This stage is followed by the stage of accommodation, in which the boundaries between groups become clearly marked and respected on both sides (that is, the stage of segregation). Finally, there is assimilation, as the subordinate group adopts the ways of the dominant group and eventually disappears into it. These theoretical models were fruitful in stimulating considerable research, but in the end they were not substantiated. The ecological picture of deviance suffers, we have discovered, from numerous flaws: It overlooks the fact that people can move into an area after becoming deviant, rather than becoming deviant because they are there; it ignores biases against reporting crime and other deviance by inhabitants of the more respectable areas; and it is guilty of the "ecological fallacy" in statistical inference (of which Durkheim was also frequently guilty) of supposing that the average characteristics of the people in an area can be taken as reliable evidence of how particular individuals are being affected. (For example, we cannot conclude anything if the area with the lowest average education has the highest suicide rate, for it may be the highly educated persons in that area who are committing suicide.) Similarly, Park's model of the race- relations cycle turns out to be purely speculative as far as the crucial stage— assimilation—is concerned. The experience of such groups as black Americans has shown us that assimilation may occur in language and politics without occurring in the economy or in personal relations. Nor is there an inevitable trend from conflict to accommodation; indeed, events can run in the opposite direction (as in the 1960s), and the theory does not tell us when or why this may happen. In general, the principal shortcoming of the Chicago school turned out to be the thinness of its theorizing, and this in the end was to be its downfall. It has since lapsed into a preoccupation with statistical methods and descriptions, in the virtual absence of explanatory theory. Park's ecological model was merely an approach to describing the city and lacked any real substantive or predictive power. The naive optimism of his theory of race relations is obvious today. Missing from Park's theory—and missing as far back as Thomas's The Polish Peasant—were clear ideas of stratification, of power, and of politics. An approach to these things, however, was developing outside the granite walls of the Chicago school. In fact, the empirical tradition had already been launched. W. E. B. Du Bois, in 1899, had already carried out a massive research project called The Philadelphia Negro. But American sociology at the turn of the century, like the rest of the society, was segregated, and Du Bois remained scarcely known. Even among black leaders, Du Bois was regarded as a dangerous radical; his only recognition came from Max Weber, far away in Germany.</p>
<p class="calibre1">W.E.B. DU BOIS AND AFRICAN- AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY From Great Barrington to Harvard and Berlin William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1868, thr^e years after the end of the Civil War and five years after the Emancipation Proclamation. His ancestry was a mixture of mostly African, some Dutch, and a strain of French. His grandfather, Tom Burghardt, fought in the American Revolutionary War, and his service freed him and his family from slavery before the Bill of Rights of 1780, which declared all slaves in Massachusetts free. Du Bois' boyhood was typical of today's single-parent: households, and he credited his mother with being a strong and nurturing influence during his youth after his roaming father drifted away from his; family. The folkways and mores of polite New England society permeated the climate of opinion in Du Bois' small hometown in the valley of the Berkshires, and the precocious scholar did not feel the insult of prejudice until he realized gradually that some of the respectable Great Barringtonians considered his brown skin unfortunate. Du Bois became the local correspondent of the New York Globe at age fifteen, and used his position to better his race by giving short lectures and instructing fellow blacks on how to form their own political organizations. His growing racial awareness was evidenced by his jienior oration on the life of Wendell Phillips, the antislavery writer. Du Bois won a scholarship to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Although the Fisk faculty was white with one exception, Du Bois felt free from the shadow of the vei'. that divided the races to a much greater extent in the end-of-the-century Sauth than at his northern home. He discovered the fabric of rural black southern culture, teaching summers at a country school in a log cabin with dirt floors built before the Civil War. While serving as the chief editor of tho Fisk Herald and sharpening his comprehension of the race problem he prepared himself to fight the "color bar" in a peaceful but forthright manner. Du Bois entered Harvard as a junior in 1888 and came under the intellectual influence of the idealist philosopher George Santayana, and especially of America's pragmatist psychologist William James. He took his Ph.D. degree from Harvard in 1895 with the dissertation The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870. Vernon Loggins, literary commentator and author of The Negro Author (1931), called that work "by far the greatest intellectual achievement which had by 1900 come from any American Negro." Du Bois praised the North for its efforts on behalf of education, yet scolded the region for not providing the Afro-Americans it had schooled with economic opportunities. He argued in a Marxist vein that the southern white oligarchy exploited its workers and that political participation would enable them to protect their economic interests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Du Bois went on to the University of Berlin for postgraduate study in sociology, history, and economics under such figures as Heinrich von Treitschke and Max Weber. He assimilated from this experience the scientific methodologies of social research, including by extrapolation Weber's method of verstehen. Du Bois maintained a correspondence with the great German sociologist, and Du Bois' novels and sociological writings reveal an empathic understanding of people's subjective understandings. Weber requested that Du Bois write an article on "The Negro Question in the U.S." for the Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, which Weber edited. The Founding of Afro-American Sociology Du Bois experienced culture shock in returning to a racist American society and found no openings for teachers at the black colleges of Fisk, Howard, and Hampton. He did land a job at Wilberforce College in Ohio, teaching Latin and Greek. However, the political and church hierarchies at the college, which was administered by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, put a damper on his social scientific plans for Afro-American freedom. The school was in dire financial straits, and he barely received a sympathetic ear. The University of Pennsylvania hired Du Bois, the first black to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard, as an assistant instructor in 1896 to conduct a research project in Philadelphia's Seventh Ward slums. Du Bois took advantage of this opportunity to study the life of the blacks as a social system. He moved into a neighborhood apartment with his new bride and applied the social research methods of participant observation, multivariate and statistical analysis, and demographic mapping for the black population. Du Bois believed that sociological method, including verstehen, would go a long way toward solving the race problem, and he interviewed five thousand respondents with various questionnaires. The resulting book, The Philadelphia Negro, is the first major empirical work in American sociology. Although he was critical of certain black social patterns, such as crime and prostitution, Du Bois eschewed the current genetic approach to social theory and blamed the social problems of the Afro-American community on the environment and the moral depradation of slavery, not innate racial inferiority. Franz Boas, anthropologist and colleague of Du Bois, says, "An unbiased estimate of the anthropological evidence so far brought forward does not permit us to countenance the belief in a racial inferiority which would unfit an individual of the Negro race to take his part in modern civilization." In 1897, W. E. B. Du Bois took charge of the work in sociology at the University of Atlanta. He laid out a ten-year-cycle study (1896-1905) of institutional aspects of black society, including mortality, business, education, art, environment, religion, and crime. When World War I broke out in 1914 Du Bois planned a one-hundred-year study program of Afro-Americans, factoring in demography; biology; socialization according to family, group, and class; the cultural patterns of morals and manners; and law and gov-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ernment. The impact of the Atlanta Studies on Afro-American sociology (1897-1910) was phenomenal; it published 2,172 pages of sophisticated analysis on a variety of issues. While Durkheim and Weber were laying the foundations for sociology in the industrial democracies of the West, Du Bois focused his energies on the foundation of an Afro-American sociology during the first four decades of the 1900s. At the first Pan-African Congress, organized by the Trinidadian English barrister H. Sylvester Williams and held in London in 1900, Du Bois declared, in l.iis address "To the Nations of the World": The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line, the question as to how far the diff srences of race—which show themselves chiefly in the color of the skin and the texture of the hair—will hereafter be made the basis of denying to over half the world the right of sharing to their utmost ability the opportunities and privilege!; of modern civilization. (ABC of Color, p. 20; Souls of Black Folk, p. 54) Theoretical Influences Weber and Marx had a greater influence on the development of Du Bois' thought and politics than Ihe fin-de-siecle Social Darwinist climate of opinion. Du Bois understood the laissez-faire evolutionist Spencer's implied "survival of the fittest" viewpoint, but the pragmatic mode of instruction and philosophy he learned from James was more useful for his purposes. Weber's emphasis on the politics of stratification, in addition to the need for systematic, sustained, and exhaustive socioeconomic historical research, characterizes Du Bois' work. The Marxist undercurrent of his writing comes out increasingly in his considerations of the African slave trade. The slave traders who debased humanity by their economically profitable but ethically immoral machinations were equivalent to the racist white European colonial bourgeoisie who were exploiting the underclass of workers or the black proletariat, which Du Bois believed destined to overthrow the bonds of caste and discrimination. The Social Evolution of Afro-American Leadership Du Bois recognized Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) as the first national black leader. Douglass was the chief abolitionist, a lecturer and writer who escaped from slavery in 1838, bought his freedom, and then founded and edited the North Star, an abolitionist paper, between 1847 and 1860. He worked with the Underground Railroad, served as a consultant to President Abraham Lincoln, and met with John Brown, a fellow abolitionist of Puritan stock, austere life style, and Christian values. Du Bois writes in his preface to his biography John Brown (1909), "John Brown worked not simply for Black Men—he worked with them; and he was a companion of their daily life, knew their faults and virtues, and felt, as few white Americans have felt, the bitter traged)r of their lot."</p>
<p class="calibre1">For black America, 1895 was a watershed year, with the passing away of Douglass and the emergence of a new leader, Booker T. Washington. His "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895 favored a program of industrial and trade school education, and political conciliation of the South, until Afro- Americans could attain first-class citizenship by becoming an effective labor force. Washington was a great orator and charismatic leader who emerged as the spokesman of America's ten million blacks. Du Bois had both praise and criticism for the new leader in his essay "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others" in The Souls of Black Folk (1903). Du Bois said It startled the nation to hear a Negro advocating such a programme after many decades of bitter complaint; it startled and won the applause of the South, it interested and won the admiration of the North; and after a confused murmur of protest, it silenced if it did not convert the Negroes themselves. Washington founded Alabama's Tuskegee Institute with the financial help of northern industrialists, and especially Andrew Carnegie, who contributed six hundred thousand dollars. Tuskegee taught young black students such trades as carpentry, tailoring, printing, dressmaking, mattress making, plumbing, laundering, and domestic service. This was hardly a militant threat to the racial class structure. In the conservative atmosphere of the time, Tuskegee emerged as one of America's most famous training schools, and its president became the most sought-after AfrcnAmerican in the United States. The Tuskegeean's peak years were 1899-1905. He received honorary degrees from Dartmouth and Harvard and became an adviser to Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William H. Taft. Tuskegee gained notoriety as the "White House" for black affairs. Du Bois came into conflict with Washington because Du Bois believed strongly in the value of a college education, the vote, and self-assertion for political and civil rights. Although both were dedicated black nationalists, Du Bois believed that the higher education of a "Talented Tenth" could acquire the knowledge of modern culture to guide the progress of Afro- Americans to a higher civilization. Du Bois' concept of the "Talented Tenth" was developed in an essay in The New Negro (1903) and held that a trained minority was necessary to provide the service and leadership for mass advance. Du Bois' interests went beyond empirical social science into politics; Herbert Aptheker called him a "prophet agitator" and Elliot Rudwick called his biography of Du Bois W. E. B. Du Bois: Voice of the Black Protest Movement. Du Bois launched the Niagra Movement in 1905, and served as its general secretary. He gave credit for its founding to F. L. McGhee, who suggested it, C. C. Bentley, who planned the organizational method, and W. M. Trotter, who firmed up the platform. Du Bois drafted the principles of membership and the plan of attack. The group consisted of members of the "Talented Tenth," who were committed to implementation of such constitutional rights as the First Amendment freedom of speech and criticism, free and unsubsidized press, the vote, abolition of caste distinc-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions based on race and color, recognition of human brotherhood as a practical creed for the present age, highest-quality training without monopoly of class or race, dignity of labor, and a "unified effort to realize these ideals under wise and courageous leadership" (Foner, 1890-1919,1, p. 146). Du Bois urged the necessity of complaint against rather than compliance to social injustice. That position was the nexus of conflict with BTW, as Booker T. Washington was known. Du Bois, the Atlanta sage, urged his adherents to take radical action against the curtailment of Afro-American political rights. His program : ncluded urging blacks to vote intelligently and effectively, pushing civil rights, organizing business cooperation and increasing interest in college education, opening new avenues of employment and holding the old, distrib uting information on laws of health, pushing the study of black history, aligning white labor unions and blacks into mutual understanding, increasing .he circulation of honest, unsubsidized periodicals and newspapers, and having all civilized agencies attack crime. Du Bois said, "In fact to do all in our power by word or deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood, rights and the performance of its just duties" (Fcner, 1890-1919,1, p. 148). Du Bois had the soul of a poet combined with the intellect of a scientist. In The Voice of the Negro (1905) he wrote: God give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands; Men whom lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor, men who will not lie; Men who can stand before ;i demagogue, And damn his treacherous batterers without winking. Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog In public duty and private 1 hinking. For when the rabble, with tieir thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions and their little deeds, Mingling selfish strife—lo, Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps. (Foner, 1890-1919,1, p. 149) The Niagra Movement ran for five years as the first Afro-American national organization that nude aggressive and unconditional demands for the same civil rights enjoyed by all Americans. Washington continued his</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts to destroy the movement. Nevertheless, at its final meeting, the Niagra Movement took some credit for "increasing spiritual unrest, sterner impatience with cowardice and deeper determination to be men at any cost" (Foner, 1890-1919, I, p. 116). The Niagra Movement, which had filled the de facto leadership gap of the Afro-American Council, was the predecessor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Under Du Bois' leadership the Niagra Movement laid track for younger men and women to follow. The twenty-year reign of Booker T. Washington ended in 1915 with his death. The next strong leader to emerge on the scene of black society was Marcus Garvey. World War I had motivated a rural to urban migration, and Garvey set up headquarters for his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in Harlem, New York, with branches in several American cities and foreign countries. Garvey, a Jamaican, was a professional printer; he was also an even more intensely charismatic leader than Washington. Garvey had a genius for showmanship and a dynamic personality that he used to establish the first mass movement among black Americans. His dream was for black industry and commerce and the ultimate freedom of Africa. Although Du Bois agreed with the UNIA's goals of the instillation of black racial pride and community organization, he criticized Garvey's lack of business acumen and his attitude that the United States was the real estate of the white race and that the black should not fight for social equality within American society. The NAACP and The Crisis Du Bois was one of the founders of the interracial National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and he was appointed by the board as director of publications and research and editor of its propaganda organ, The Crisis. His editorship from 1909 to 1934 gave Du Bois the opportunity to exercise his sociological imagination for an educated black public and present black role models for the Afro-American community of the times. Although Du Bois was in conflict with O. V. Villard, NAACP treasurer, and criticized by others for his personal aloofness and intellectual elitism, he persisted in his aim of cultural pluralism. Du Bois was considered radical for his emphasis on ongoing black nationalism and on a broader basis for his desire for a multiracial society. At the Universal Races Congress in London in 1910, Du Bois advocated an overarching trans- racial "human brotherhood." The Crisis and its controversial editor reached their high point during World War I, when there was an accompanying flood of democratic propaganda for the equal rights doctrine prior to the advent of Garvey. Gunnar Myrdal observed, "Under the influence both of the criticism from the Du Bois group and of much changed conditions, he came increasingly to move toward an ideology which incorporated and expressed the Negro protest in cautious but no uncertain terms" (Myrdal, An American Dilemma, New York: Harpers, 1944, p. 743).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Du Bois' Empirical and Theoretical Work Du Bois emphasized the preeminence of the environmental approach over the genetic doctrine in his empirical work The Philadelphia Negro (1899) and later writings. Despite the prevailing tendency to stress nature over nurture in the scientific air at the turn of the nineteenth century, Du Bois disallowed any inherent or inherited racial superiority of white over black. In his chapter on "The Environment of the Negro" Du Bois described a stratification system for blacks of four grades: the well-to do, laborers, the poor, and criminals. This model adds a moral dimension to the earlier economic analysis of class in his chapter on "The Negro Family." Du Bois' stratification research foreshadowed the later research in American sociology of E. Franklin Frazier, W. Lloyd Warner, and C. Wright Mills. The empirical research methodology of Ihe Philadelphia Negro includes a variety of representations, including maps of the Seventh Ward and the city, tables, graphs, demographic curves, and statistical data stimulated by the work of Charles Booth and Francis Galton in England. The work, based on detailed questionnaires for the five thousand recipients, was carried out by Du Bois singlehandedly. Du Bois' classic work The Souls of Black Folk (1903) is an extraordinary collection of essays compo!;ed in a poetic prose that emphasizes the predictive power of sociology regarding the racial conflicts that continue to plague our species and urges the autonomy of the black community. Du Bois defined the main problem of the twentieth century as the problem of the color line. Yet he went further, injecting a note of evolutionary optimism into his historical explanation of sociological variables: It is, then, the strife of all honorable men of the twentieth century to see that in the future competition of races the survival of the fittest shall mean the triumph of the good, the beautiful, and the true; that we may be able to preserve for future civilization all that is really fine and noble and strong, and not continue to put a premium on greed and impudence and cruelty. (Souls of Black Folk, p. 188) Du Bois' Role as Elder Statesman In his later career, Du Bois became a global traveler, advocating Pan- Africanism and world peace. He stressed the context of slavery, disenfran- chisement, Jim Crow legislation, and antiblack racial prejudice and discrimination as negative conditioning factors against the emergence of a rationally conscious mode af high self-esteem for Afro-Americans. Du Bois set the stage both for the integrationist "dream" of Dr. Martin Luther King and the politics of black pr: de of Malcolm X and others. Such organizations as the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Urban League, NAACP, and Black Panther party of the 1960s-1990s were all influenced in some manner by Du Bois' political activism and social thought. Du Bois used his tenur2 as chairman of Atlanta University's sociology</p>
<p class="calibre1">department, 1934-1944, to promote social studies for black colleges and graduate schools with requests for financial support from individuals, foundations, and governments. The Atlanta University Conference of 1943 was the first meeting of black land grant colleges to coordinate a program of cooperative social studies. Du Bois chaired the conference committee, which brought the support of Howard Odum, Edward Reuter, E. Franklin Frazier, Charles Johnson, Donald Young, and other eminent American sociologists. The idea of an Encyclopedia of the Negro was projected in 1909 by Du Bois, but backers did not come up with the funding until 1931. Robert E. Park of the University of Chicago and W. E. B. Du Bois were the first editorial board collaborators. Guy B. Johnson of the University of North Carolina succeeded Park in the late 1930s. Du Bois pressed for the civil rights of blacks through the Thirteenth to Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution and for the human rights of blacks by founding the Pan-African Movement, which held five congresses from 1900 to 1945, stressing Africa for the Africans instead of for the colonial profit of European nations. Du Bois, who was referred to as the "Old Man" by blacks in the 1960s, became a symbolic leader of his race by going to Africa when he was in his nineties. President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana appointed him to direct a secretariat for an Encyclopedia Africana in Accra, the capital of Ghana. Du Bois coordinated these efforts, which were sponsored by the Ghana Academy of Sciences. The "Old Man," who had visited Nikita Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung, lost faith in the United States and became a citizen of Ghana. The proud and prolific Atlanta sage, who founded Afro-American sociology, criticized his ex-country for having betrayed the American Revolution's concept of justice. When Martin Luther King lead the March for Jobs in Washington, D.C., in 1963 Du Bois led a parallel demonstration in Accra. Du Bois died on August 27, 1963, at the age of ninety-five, his prophetic black soul home in the land of his roots. THE INVESTIGATION OF SOCIAL CLASS Du Bois remained on the periphery of American sociology. More attention went to black sociologists in the 1930s and 1940s, especially those who were trained at the center of the sociological Establishment, at Chicago, and who were sponsored by Chicago networks. Thus E. Franklin Frazier, who took his degree at Chicago under the influence of Robert Park and Ernest W. Burgess, became the most famous black sociologist and eventually president of the American Sociological Association. His dissertation on The Negro Family in Chicago, published in 1932, launched a controversy within sociology over the question of lower-class black family structure as an obstacle to black social advancement. In the 1940s black sociologists from Chicago, St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton, produced Black Metropolis, a famous study of class stratification within the black community.</p>
<p class="calibre1">200 The Vicissitudes of Twentieth-Century Sophistication By this time mainstream empirical research had shifted its focus. American sociologists had .discovered the centrality of social class. Not just inequality between races, but a dimension of economic stratification within them, was becoming the center of attention. The first to bring attention to the themes of social stratification in American sociology was, strangely enough, a young theologian from Princeton Theological Seminary. This was Robert Lynd, who, with his wife Helen Merrill Lynd, was preparing to set out on missionary work in Africa when he received a grant from a religious foundation to study religiaus behavior in the United States. The Lynds chose Muncie, Indiana, a prospering industrial town in the Midwest. Their approach, influenced by anthropological studies of primitive tribes, was to take up residence, to participate and observe as widely as possible, and to interview local informants. The Lynds soon concluded that the gap between white-collar (middle-class) ,ind manual (lower-class) workers was by far the most crucial element in determining people's life styles, and they proceeded to produce the first study of a community's stratification. After eighty years Marx's fundamental. sociological ideas began to receive some systematic empirical verification. The studies of Muncie, reported under the title of Middletown (1929), with a follow-up study during the Depression (Middletown in Transition, 1937), were immediately recognized. Robert Lynd became a professor of sociology at Columbia in 1931 and thus helped found a second major center of empirical research. Lynd became something of a spokesman for a liberal-left position in sociology; his son, the historian Staughton Lynd, became a prominent antiwar leader in the 1960s. At about the same time that Lynd was working in Muncie, the anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner was finishing a study of Australian aboriginal tribes (published under the title A Black Civilization) and deciding to apply his techniques to a study of the natives of the modern United States. He chose the staid old town of Newburyport, Massachusetts, which was to appear in the research repoits from 1941 onward as "Yankee City." New England struck back in defense with a satirical novel about an anthropologist who comes to study a seacoast town, Point of No Return by John P. Marquand. In the end, however, Warner had the upper hand in this exchange. His research has been criticized in various ways, most notably for its overemphasis on a supposedly rigid status ranking of the populace, but Warner's analysis of the religious and patriotic rituals of the Newburyporters (in The Living and the Dead, 1959) is a brilliant application of Durkheim's perspective to a modern society. Only a person with the detachment of an experienced anthropologist could have carried it off. Warner went on to study a midwestern town, national business leaders, and large-scale organizational trends in America, with increasing emphasis on surveys and statistics. Tiis methodology has become increasingly popular throughout sociology, "he percentage of articles reporting statistics in the major sociological jourrals increased from 10 percent during the period from 1915 to 1924 to 60 percent during the period from 1955 to 1964. This trend represents the self-co:iscious effort of sociologists to become "scientif-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ic." The effects of this change have been both good and bad for the discipline. In his presidential address before the American Sociological Society in 1929, the Chicago sociologist William F. Ogburn announced sociology's scientific coming-of-age and its exclusion of mere social do-gooders. This was also a personal confession for Ogburn, who had begun his career as a Socialist and had gradually shifted to an emphasis on detached quantitative research on population and technological trends. Questionnaire surveys became the order of the day. George Gallup began his preelection polling in the 1936 presidential election, and in 1940 a Columbia research team began the first serious effort to study the determinants of people's votes. In the 1940s and 1950s survey research became the dominant mode of research and was applied to everything from political attitudes to religious beliefs, school achievement, social mobility, and sexual behavior. Great improvements were made in the collection of reliable data and in methods of analysis. By i960 every major university had its buzzing computer center, surrounded by hosts of researchers, programmers, interviewers, coders, and statisticians. Research had become a large-scale enterprise, and sociologists had to become adept at securing grants from foundations or government agencies to foot the bills. On the positive side sociology began to acquire a basis of hard knowledge. The old racial theories of behavior were among the first victims of this collection of facts, as sociologists documented the influence of social conditions on social success and social deviance. By the 1930s it was demonstrated that the range of intelligence is about the same among blacks as among whites. The biasing effect of social conditions on the IQ scores of people in deprived environments was also documented. The effect on theory was a negative one—the destruction of the biological-evolutionist model. The collection of data tended to corroborate some theories—especially the general sociological positions of Marx and Weber on the importance of stratification in social behavior, although this theoretical connection had long gone unnoticed by American sociologists. Quite without premeditation, researchers found that social class was the best predictor of behavior of all sorts, from political preferences to religious beliefs, marriage and child-rearing patterns, media participation, life styles, and types of deviance. It is not the only determinant though; and the effects of other dimensions of stratification (Weber's cultural status distinctions, education, and religion) on all of these behaviors were also demonstrated. American sociology was not exactly rushing forward in elaborating these theories, however. Indeed, a pronounced tendency toward foot dragging was apparent as far as theory construction was concerned. The methods for collecting data gradually became more sophisticated as sociologists learned how to achieve a reliable sample of the population, how to ask questions that did not bias the respondent, and how to apply the proper statistical test to show when results were not due merely to chance. The best of the survey researchers evolved a method known as multivariate analysis, which takes account of the fact that behavior usually has multiple</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes and shows how to control each cause in relation to the others so that the effect of each might be assessed. But in general this approach tended to concentrate more and mere on its own technical problems and to forget about using its data to bui Id general explanatory theory. Not only did technique tend to become an and in itself, but the survey researchers began to make a fetish out of numters, to the point where they came to regard "empirical" as meaning quantitative data only. Where taken as an absolute requirement, this has restricted research to a few tightly structured loopholes on the world, missing mo ;t of the action and struggle during which things actually happen. The same sort of limitation can be found in the research in experimental social psychology that has grown up since the 1940s. The founding figure in this movement was the Gorman gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin, in exile in America since the 1930s, ike so many of his colleagues. This research has made impressive demonstrations on such topics as how groups influence individual conformity in perceptions and beliefs and how groups solve problems. But although there have been long strings of cumulative experiments on particular topics, such research has been as yet little related to any of the major theories in sociology. Experimental social psychology is on the borderline of sociology and psychology and more often than not has proceeded from purely psychological (individual) perspectives, with a corresponding behaviorist-inspired emphasis on methodological purity to the exclusion of all else. Experimental study of small groups has nevertheless accumulated a fair amount of knowledge that yields some potentially important contributions to sociological theory. THE SOCIOLOGY OF ORGANIZATIONS The missing link seems li &lt;ely to come through yet another modern area of research, one that occupies a strategic position in sociology, the field of organizations. Organizatior al research got its real start in the 1930s with a pair of contributions emanating from Harvard Business School. In 1927 the industrial psychologist Elton Mayo began carrying out a long series of experiments on worker productivity at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company in Chicago. The researchers began with a conventional industrial-engineering ap aroach, treating workers as part of the machinery to be manipulated by an efficiency expert; their initial experiments varied the lighting in the factory to observe its effects on production. But whether they turned the lights up or down, production seemed to increase. Mayo's associates hit on the idea that the workers were responding to being studied: Instead of treating them like cogs in a machine, someone was interested in them personally, and the workers appreciated the attention. To test this so-called "Hawthorne effect," the Mayo team set up further experiments in ths factory, in which they paid attention to the personal reactions of the workers. These results were not interpreted entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurately, and the Mayo group tended to overstate their new philosophy: that management must concentrate on "human relations" (and implicitly ignore the economics of workers' pay, which is actually quite important). Nevertheless, the Hawthorne studies took organizations out of the hands of the purely technologically oriented engineers and "management scientists" and placed the emphasis squarely on the dynamics of the "informal group" of workers. This work was complemented by the publication in 1938 of a book entitled The Functions of the Executive, by Chester I. Barnard. Barnard, then lecturing at Harvard Business School, was the former president of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. (Incidentally, Western Electric is the manufacturer of telephone equipment for the Bell system. It appears that this is a very research-oriented company. The Bell Telephone laboratories in New Jersey continue to be the leading nonacademic and nongovernment research center in the social sciences in America.) Barnard argued from his own experience that the lines of authority in an organization chart are a myth. Trie president of a company is like a politician, not a puppeteer, declared Barnard; his subordinates are the ones who run the organization, and his job is merely to create the right climate in which they will get the job done. Barnard's shrewd observations on organization politics at the top and middle ranks fitted nicely with the Hawthorne studies that showed that the workers enforced an informal norm over each other, so that no one individual would work too hard to show up the others in the eyes of management. Organizations were suddenly transformed into living things; they were no longer abstract charts or inert machines. Since the 1930s a great deal of research has been generated on organizations. Much of the best of it came from Chicago, where Park's student Everett Hughes guided an enormous number of studies of various occupations "from the inside," ranging from undertakers, janitors, and policemen to physicians, lawyers, and scientists. By the 1960s the field of organizational research had accumulated data on a wide range of topics and had arrived at a fair degree of understanding of the ways people struggle to gain or to evade control in organizations, of the way an organization's goals and outputs are affected, and of the determinants of different sorts of organizational structure. Although far from completed, a genuine explanatory theory has evolved in the field of organizations. This theory is the product not only of sociologists but of researchers in business administration and political science, as well as in economics, psychology, and history. Perhaps more than any other area of research, the field of organizations ties together and develops the great sociological theories, especially the stream proceeding from Weber on through Michels and Mannheim (see Chapter 12). By no means have all the researchers in this field been aware of this connection. For sociological research as a whole, the contributions of empirical research to theory building have remained more potential than actual. This is not the full story, however. It is impossible for research to pro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceed for very long without some guiding questions being asked. American sociology got its start frort the evolutionary and social-problem orientations of the nineteenth century. The wave of research since the 1920s has destroyed most of the old beliefs, but American research sociology as a whole acquired no new theory to replace what it had rejected. As a result, the old social-problem sorts of questions continued to guide research for a long time after they lost their original significance. For example, sociology was agitated for decades by the question of whether social mobility he.d declined in America, of whether the society was becoming more rigid or "closed," since the supposedly wide-open frontier era. By the late 19 50s, after thirty years of speculation, argument, and research, it was possible to give a definitive answer to the question: The amount of social mobility in America had changed very little, at least during the twentieth century. (It was not so very great in the first place.) In the process of answering this question, sociologists had overcome a large number of technical difficulties entailed in accurately measuring and comparing mobility rates. But there has been little effort to ask the general theoretical question: What determines the amount of social mobility in a society? The latter sort of question requires a larger perspective, and recent decades have seen a revival of comparative and historical studies and an accompanying theoretical orientation that: should eventually correct this deficiency. But this illustration shows just how much our highly technical research depends on old, perhaps forgotten, debates over social issues. The old river bed goes on even though the water has dried up. Remarkably, all this has gone on after the time of the great intellectual revolution described in Part II of this volume. What happened in the twentieth century was that sociology split into a "high tradition" and a "low tradition." The latter has dominated America, where characteristically the most engrossing issues hive come to be methodological debates, even though it should be apparent that the advance of sociological knowledge depends on melding the data generated by various methods around the construction of an integraled explanatory theory. This split should not be exaggerated, however. The intellectual revolution of Durkheim, Weber, Freud, and Mead has sent out its shock waves rather slowly, but the twentieth century has seen its gradual penetration into the far-flung territories of sociology. The following chapters take up the various streams of its progress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER ELEVEN The Construction of the Social System: Pareto and Parsons "Who now reads Spencer? It is difficult for us to realize how great a stir he made in the world. ... He was the intimate confidant of a strange and rather unsatisfactory God, whom he called the principle of Evolution. His God has betrayed him. We have evolved beyond Spencer." Professor Brinton's verdict may be paraphrased as that of the coroner," Dead by suicide or at the hands of person or persons unknown." We must agree with the verdict. Spencer is dead. But who killed him and how? This is the problem.1 Talcott Parsons (1902-1979) entered the sociological arena in 1937 as a detective investigating the demise of the culminating system of liberal rationalism. Spencer died with the optimism of the nineteenth century. He was the last of the great system builders, explaining everything—why people act, why institutions exist, why history moves in certain directions. Talcott Parsons has been the only man of the twentieth century to attempt the same with any success while living up to the new standards of sophistication. His detective work was aimed at finding out why systems no longer seemed possible; he aimed not to gloat on the fact but to overcome the new obstacles. Parsons was the first man to see clearly the breakdown of nineteenth- century rationalism and the great breakthroughs of Durkheim, Weber, and Freud. His system is an effort to synthesize these breakthroughs. He was only partly successful. His position is unmistakably more derivative of Durkheim than of Weber, and he overlooks the achievements of Mead and his tradition entirely. Parsons also marks the schism in American sociology between the high tradition and the low tradition. Many sociologists have stuck with the concerns and issues of the nineteenth-century reformers—individual mobility, deviance, social disorganization and its cures—merely casting them in 'Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action, Vol. 1, p. 3. Published in 1968 by The Free Press Division of The Macmillan Company (original edition 1937). Reprinted by permission. 205</p>
<p class="calibre1">more behavioristic terminology and going ahead with empirical studies only loosely related to any explanatory theory. Parsons represented an era in which general theory we s largely divorced from detailed research, a split that has been slow in healing. Parsons himself was limited by the Anglo- American tradition whose grand theories he tried to revive, especially by a rather behavioristic interpretation of Freud, a patriotic naivete about politics, and a propensity to elaborate too many abstractions. But more of this later. First we must turn to a man very different in temperament from the optimistic Parsons—Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923), probably the most cynical social thinker of modern times. Pareto, more than anyone else, represented the attack on the liberal rationalist tradition, and from him Parsons derived his sophistication about how to build a system in an era when no truly modern mind thought it still possible. PARETO'S LIFE AND WORKS Pareto's life coincides with the events that soured liberal positivist hopes in Europe to the point that they scarcely survived into the twentieth century. Born in Paris of an Italian father and a French mother, he grew up in Italy during the heroic years oi' Garibaldi. He studied science and engineering and began his career almout simultaneously with the rise of the newly united Italian constitutional monarchy in 1871. Like many another young man he was an ardent, idealistic democrat. He worked for a railroad company and then as a superintendent of iron mines in the booming industrial north. At age thirty-four, Pareto received an inheritance that enabled him to retire and devote himself to research and writing. His field was economics, the classical science of British liberalism. In this field one plots the results of individuals' acting as rational decision makers, following their independent interests in the network of contractual exchanges that creates a nation's wealth and measures out ;he common good with an invisible hand. Pareto soon distinguished himself as one of the great rigorists who introduced sophisticated mathematical methods into economics. His position in the discipline is still marked by the concept of "Pareto optimum," which bears his name. His efforts brought him a chair of economics at the University of Lausanne in 1892, when he was forty-four. But Italian democracy was not going well. The old enemies had not given up; the nobles still kept the peasants in poverty and near-serfdom in the south; the priests stit reconciled the faithful to their lot and warned against the godlessness of reformers. And new enemies arose: labor unionists, Socialist agitators fighting against the sixteen-hour day, the thirteen- hour day, and the eleven-hour day in the factories of Turin and Milan. Anarchists appeared from the teeming slums, proclaiming property to be theft and parliamentary democracy to be a sham. In 1900 an anarchist's bomb took the life of the constitutional monarch King Humbert. Parliaments went through one deadlock after another; politicians did what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could for friends and supporters by getting them paid government jobs. Grinding poverty was the lot not only of the workers but also of the underpaid lower-middle class, epitomized by the hardships of a young Socialist schoolteacher named Benito Mussolini. Nearing the age of fifty, disillusioned, Pareto retired to his villa above Lake Lausanne to think. He became a mysterious figure; the world began to call him "the hermit of Celigny." Shortly after the turn of the twentieth century he emerged with a book, but not on economics. The science of rational behavior had betrayed him. What he needed now was sociology. His first sociological book was an attack on socialism, which Pareto declared a new form of religious superstition. In the guise of reason it created Utopian worlds without struggle, which the Socialist and anarchist leaders used to inflame their followers against the upholders of democracy and of the nation. There was another long silence from Celigny as Europe plunged onward into World War I. In 1915, now an old man of sixty-seven, Pareto published his great work: the five-volume General Treatise on Sociology, to become famous under the English title, The Mind and Society. PARETO'S SYSTEM Pareto's system may be summarized as follows: 1. Societies have great stability. Whenever something happens to upset the old order—revolution, war, crime, natural catastrophe—there is a reaction, a conservative movement to restore order. After Robespierre came Thermidor and Napoleon; after 1848 came Napoleon II; after an assassination the nation recoils to the party of law and order. Most change is only apparent; new governments— republican, monarchist, Bonapartist, Socialist—only change the ruling ideology, while underneath things go on in much the same way. In the formal terms of the economist, society is a system in equilibrium. A change in one direction is compensated for by a change in the opposite direction. To the liberal faith in evolution and progress, Pareto answered with bitter wisdom: "Plus qa change, plus c'est la meme chose." 2. The economist sees people as rational decision makers, choosing among alternatives, seeking the correct path to maximize gain and avoid loss. By that criterion we must recognize that most action is not logical. The reasons people give for what they do cannot stand up under examination. They act first, then justify what they have done. The judge hands down his decision to fit the power interest of his associates, then cloaks it in high-sounding legal terminology. Moreover, people are easily taken in by false reasoning. All that one needs to make them accept slavery is to give it the name of freedom. Many actions cannot even be assessed by the standards of rationality; like the kneeling of the peasants before the priest, they are rituals. Except for scientists, stockbrokers, and a few others, most individuals are nonlogical most of the time. Thus economics must be superseded as the main science of human behavior. 3. If one examines the reasons people give for their actions, one finds certain constant themes reappearing throughout history. These Pareto termed "residues," which may be interpreted as basic human motives. The main two residues are</p>
<p class="calibre1">208 The Vicissitudes of Twer tieth-Century Sophistication called the instinct of comt inations (inventiveness or creativity) and the instinct of group persistence, or persistence of aggregates (conservative or security needs). There are also changing elements in human beliefs, which Pareto termed "derivatives," consisting of such ideologies as Christianity, democracy, and socialism. 4. The basic forces in society, according to Pareto's hypothesis, are "sentiments." Sentiments can never be c irectly observed, since they are biological forces or instincts, presumably shifting with the genetic currents of the human race. One can only infer the sentiments :'rom their manifestations, the residues and derivatives. Such inference is a risky t usiness, but it is unavoidable if one is to capture the overall picture. Science selves complex problems by the method of successive approximations: Hypothesize a model of the forces at work; test it against the evidence; readjust the model where it fits badly; test it out on more evidence; and so on. This is presumably why Pareto needed five volumes to write his system. Moreover, his biological hypotheses were in the current scientific vogue of naturalistic explanations. Indi /idual success and failure, crime, and mental illness were all attributed to racial or family heredity. Spencer's evolutionism had moved increasingly into &lt;l literal biological determinism. 5. Not everyone has the same mixture of sentiments. In most people the strongest sentiments are the conservative and social ones. This is what one would expect from an evolutionary poi it of view; if strong group-preserving instincts were not predominant, it is unlikel y that societies would survive. This fact accounts for the stability of societies. 6. Some people, however, are cleverer, stronger, and more individualistic than others. In society, as in nature, there is a continual struggle for dominance. In this struggle the guileful people win out, both by using force and by appealing to the sentiments of the dull, co nservative ones. There is thus always an elite, and revolutions change only the leaders. But there is a certain pattern to the changes in dominance. The guileful people, whom Pareto calls the foxes, rise to the top. If too many of them become concentrated at the top, however, the whole tone of society takes on too mud i originality, too much rationality, too much clever flunking, too many new ideas. Since the social order is built primarily on conservative instincts and feelings for security, the foxes eventually undermine their own position. Society is thrown increasingly into chaos—wars, revolutions, parliamentary strife—and a reaction sets in. The lions, the strong individuals who appeal to the conservative instincts of the masses, take over. Eventually the foxes begin to rise to the top again, using their guile against the stupidity of the lions, and the cycle begins agai a. In politics, as elsewhere in Pareto's system, the principle of dynamic equilibrium holds. CRITICISMS OF PARETO Pareto's theory is easy to criticize. It does not account for many of the observable changes in socisty. There may always be an elite, but why is it sometimes large and sortetimes small, sometimes organized in a feudal system, sometimes in a patrimonial empire, sometimes in a mass party democracy? We may always fall short of equality, but what determines</p>
<p class="calibre1">variations in the degree of concentration of wealth? Pareto's research methodology is sloppy, consisting mainly of analyzing and classifying what various classical authors (Plutarch, Cicero, Thucydides, and others) and miscellaneous newspaper clippings have said about the reasons people act the way they do. The biological explanation commits the fallacy of obscurum per obscurius—explaining something that is only dimly known by something completely hidden. The procedure results in explanations that cannot be tested. If Pareto were asked why the people of Sparta were more easily regimented by their leaders than were the Athenians, he would reply that the Spartans had more of the sentiment of group persistences. It should be said in fairness that Pareto's method might have paid off if indeed his hypothetical sentiments had some attributes that might make them independently verifiable, like the genes in genetic theory later discovered in the cell. This they lacked, and Durkheim's logic tells us why such attributes of individuals would never be an adequate explanation of society in any case. But to end with this critique is to miss Pareto's significance and perhaps to fault him for something he was not trying to do. At the very general level on which he worked, Pareto is mostly right. People do have sentiments, not just practical interests. Economic humankind and liberal rationalism are false leads. Deviations from rational social exchange are not due merely to a lack of information about full market conditions, and more education and better communications will not basically change things. Individuals often act in the service of nonempirical, purely symbolic ends, to which the standards of rational behavior cannot be applied at all. Furthermore, it is the rationalists who have the unworkable image of society; society is held together by nonrational sentiments, not by a deliberate social contract. On the last point Pareto's theory converges with Durkheim's argument for the necessity of precontractual solidarity. Parsons was to make much of these elements in Pareto's thought, plus his logical sophistication about the procedure of successive approximations and his concept of society as an abstract system of interacting parts in dynamic equilibrium. (The last concept is itself justified as something postulated under the method of successive approximations.) The more cynical side Parsons left out, ignoring Pareto's emphasis on force, deceit, and struggle in politics and substituting for Pareto's conservative pessimism a new evolutionary model of progress within the social system. But here Pareto was more perceptive than Parsons. Most politics most of the time certainly fits his general description. Observers who cannot (and do not want to) see through political ideologies are simply acting with that concern for social belonging that Pareto saw as such a widespread motive. In 1922, seven years after Pareto's treatise appeared, Mussolini came to power in Rome. Fascism, an innovation inconceivable to the nineteenth-century liberal mind, proved in fact what Durkheim, Weber, Freud, and Pareto had already proved in theory: that the naive positivistic theory of humankind was inadequate to reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">PARSONS' LIFE AND WORKS It is a long jump from Fascist Italy and the morose Pareto to the sedate halls of Harvard University in the 1930s. But there is some slight continuity in our theme, for here Talcott Parsons was carrying out one of the great coups of academic politics. A young economics instructor, he had studied with the great anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics and had learned the functionalist theories of Durkheim before they appeared in English. He went on to do his doctorate at Heidelberg on Weber's economic history and translated The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for American publication. Arriving back at Harvard, he soon joined the sociology deparlment, newly founded in 1930. As the citadel of Ameri:an scholarship, Harvard had waited thirty years to see if this new discipine would prove respectable. When the issue seemed finally decided in :.ts favor, the usual search was made for the most eminent person in the field to head the new department. This person was judged to be Pitirim Sorolin. Sorokin was a Russian, formerly secretary to Alexander Kerensky (the head of the Provisional Government of 1917), once sentenced to death by the Bolsheviks, and later exiled. Like most Russian intellectuals he wis full of grand ideas, none of which had emerged from the nineteenth century. He had published a notable book on social mobility, which marshaled all the statistical evidence of the day to embellish the theory that people owed their class positions largely to their hereditary ability. Then came hi 5 great work, the four-volume Social and Cultural Dynamics, a cyclical theory of world history, elaborately documented from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which concerned itself mainly with a perceived trend from spiritualism to materialism and back again. Like most cyclical theories, it rested mostly en the single case of the fall of the Roman Empire, and showed scanty acquaintance with non-Western history. Within a few years Parsons had displaced Sorokin as the dominant sociologist at Harvard. Through a strategic alliance with functionalist anthropologists and clinical psychologists, and with good support from far reaches of the Harvard faculty (Parsons was always a master of ecumenical movements), Parsons eventually had the sociology department replaced with a new, interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations, with himself as chairman. Sorokin found himself in exile for a second time, this time to his research institute for the study of altruistic behavior. But the coup was more than a purely local affair. Parsons brought the new European sociological theory into America at a famous university where many of the major theorists of the following decades were to receive their training. The dominance of the Chicago school was broken at about the same time, symbolized by the displacement of the Chicago-based American Journal of Sociology by the new, more theoreticaly oriented American Sociological Review as the official journal of the American Sociological Society. The times were propitious for a general change in the orientation of sociology; it was not merely a matter of Parsons' intellectual and political brilliance alone. The old evolutionist and social-disorganization theories had</p>
<p class="calibre1">degenerated into a form of biological racism that offended the awakening social conscience of the depression era. Pareto's lions and foxes and Durkheim's anomie provided some explanation for the Fascist movements of Europe and their smaller American reflections in Huey Long and Father Coughlin. At the same time the newly imported sociology offered some answer to the increasing popularity of Marxism among intellectuals; Weber in particular offered a rival theory in the very heart of economic sociology. What Parsons so successfully offered was a revived liberal sociology at a time when liberalism seemed to be breaking down on both sides. Parsons' theory has changed somewhat from his first great attempt to synthesize Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber in The Structure of Social Action, whose opening words head this chapter. In the 1940s he grew increasingly interested in Freud and less interested in Weber. This period culminated in Parsons' major systematic work, The Social System (1951). At the same time, Parsons was engineering an interdisciplinary movement to establish a common ground for all the social sciences (possibly even all the sciences), a project expressed in Toward a General Theory of Action (1951). In the 1950s it became clear that Parsons had overstepped himself in his emulation of Spencer's encyclopedic system (recall that Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy ran all the way from cosmology to ethics): that his efforts to comprehend everything drove him to elaborating extremely abstract categorizations that did not constitute a workable explanatory theory. By the 1960s Parsons had apparently lowered his sights again. He began to revive the Weberian historical sociology with which he had started out and to offer new theories on political movements. Parsons' intellectual highway was by now clearly marked, but it continued to turn up new surprises until his death in 1980. PARSONS' THEORY OF SOCIETY Parsons' writings are usually quite complex, abstract, and difficult to read. C. Wright Mills, a bitter opponent of Parsons' abstract theorizing, charged that if Parsons' works were translated into plain English, no one would be impressed. He then proceeded to translate four paragraphs of Parsons' prose into one succinctly worded paragraph of his own. Nevertheless, there is a comprehensive theory to be derived from Parsons' writings, a theory of great sophistication and sometimes of considerable power. Society as a System Social causality is very complex, since all institutions (politics, economics, family, culture, and so forth) influence each other. There are chains of causes, vicious and benevolent circles; history is a seamless web. The nineteenth-century thinkers were naive enough to think that one factor could be isolated as basic: either heredity, environment, or economics. Parsons knew that this is impossible. But the very interconnection suggests a solution: Society is a system of interrelated parts. The model is analogous to an eco-</p>
<p class="calibre1">nomic system, in which many individuals acting independently nevertheless contribute to a few predictable results (for example, prices go up or down) under the direction of an invisible hand that no one controls. The task of sociology is to search for the laws guiding the invisible hand in all of society. Parsons' major work is thus entitled The Social System. Functionalism Like Durkheim, Parsons believed that the causes of social structures must be found in their relations with other structures, not in smaller units such as individuals. The various parts of a society (polity, economy, education, religion, and so on) all serve functions for the other institutions, and they exchange these contributions for mutual support. For example, the schools train citizens and workers and in return are supported by state and industry; the church upholds family morality, and families are the bulwark of church membership—and so on. The basic idea goes back beyond economics to the old biological analogy (which Adam Smith had updated to begin modern economics) in which society is one large body, with the king as the head, the soldiers as the arms, the priests and counselors as the eyes and ears, and so on. Parsons attempted to classify the basic functions that must be carried out in any society if it is to survive. With these tools it becomes possible to analyze all societies in the same way, even though they may not have the same institutions. What we call politics, for example, Parsons called the "goal attainment" function, by which the group makes decisions for collective action. War is the most obvious example of such community action; regulating the monetary system would be another. (This may seem a rather limited view of politics, but we will discuss that criticism later.) But not all societies have anything that could be called a state; a primitive tribe, for example, may be organized only as a large kinship network. Using Parsons' concepts, we look for the function of collective action instead of for something that looks like a modern state, and we find that function is one of the things that the kinship system does, in addition to what we ordinarily think of families as doing. Parsons was fond of cross-classifying various distinctions to arrive at a related set of concepts, and his set of basic functions (there are four of them; almost everything in Parsons comes in sets of four) can be presented in that way. Everything can be classified as either a means or an end and also as either internal or external. Cross-classifying these factors we get the table shown. Means Ends External A G (adaptive) (goal attainment) Internal L I (latent pattern maintenance) (integrative)</p>
<p class="calibre1">We begin to see (and this is the simplest of Parsons' classifications) why he has such a reputation for being abstruse. At any rate, the initials A-G-I-L (or L-I-G-A) can be used as a convenient mnemonic device. Any social organization must fulfill all these four functions: maintaining basic cultural patterns (education and family socialization do this for the larger society), integrating its members into harmonious participation (religion and the legal system do this), attaining community goals (performed by the polity), and adapting to the environment (performed by the economy). The need to fulfill these functions is one of the main limitations on any social organization and, therefore, one of its prime determinants. The functional method can also be used to explain particular institutions. For example, William J. Goode, in his paper "The Theoretical Importance of Love," gives a functional analysis of romantic love in American society. Goode begins by noting that societies vary a great deal in their attitudes toward romantic attachments: Some, like modern America, view it as a good thing (in fact, a required norm, since people are not supposed to admit to marrying for any other reason). Others, like traditional China, view love as a foolish infatuation that interferes with the serious business of negotiating links between families through marriages of their children. Other societies, such as Japan, view love as neither particularly desirable nor particularly undesirable. Goode goes on to note that these differences in love norms are related to differences in the kind of kinship system: The extended kinship system in China, linked with a patriarchal household economy and a patrimonial form of polity, contrasts with the segmented nuclear family in the United States, which carries out virtually no functions other than child rearing and recreation. Thus, love is frowned upon in China because it is dysfunctional for the system, and it is virtually required in the United States because there are no other bonds except emotion to hold the family unit together and thus get the children reared. This functional explanation is not the whole story, of course; to say that something is needed does not tell us why it comes to exist. There is also a historical side to it—the creation of the romantic ideal by the medieval troubadours and the perpetuation of the ideal in the Christian church and in the marriage ceremony—and also a social-psychological side, as individuals arrange their own feelings toward each other. But Goode's functional analysis puts the question into the larger structural context, even if it does not answer all the whys and hows. Social Integration The organic analogy suggests an equilibrium model, and many of the facts seem to fit: As Pareto noticed, societies recover after wars and disasters, people are aroused to punish deviants, and so on. How can we explain this? The old social-contract ideas of the nineteenth-century theorists, who thought that individuals rationally decide to uphold the rules because it is in their self-interest, were demolished by Durkheim's critique. Other theo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ries—those of Sorokin, Spengler, and even Marx—never confronted the question at all, but assumed that societies were somehow held together. Parsons, in the forefront of mid-twentieth-century thought, could not evade the issue, which he called "the Hobbesian problem of order." This referred to Thomas Hobbes' seventeenth-century proof that the natural (that is, logical) state of self-interested humankind is not social harmony but "war of all against all." Parsons' solution was to accept Durkheim's collective conscience, the nonrational feeling of solidarity that all ongoing societies have. Parsons renamed this the "value system," following the anthropologists who had come to talk about the cultural values that a society passes down through the generations. But how explain the coercive power that the value system (or collective conscience) has over individuals? Parsons threw out Durkheim's crowd psychology and substituted Freud. The collective conscience can be found in the individual conscience, that is, in the superego. Thus Freud's view of socialization—the child identifying with the punishing parent and internalizing the parent's commands—becomes the basis for society's influence over the individual. With this stroke Parsons draws the link between the psychological level and the social level, and the core of his system is complete. At last the age-old question of social order is resolved on a sound basis. It follows from this that societies are different because they bring up children to hold different basic values. Parsons classifies these values into what he calls "pattern variables," or basic choices people are called upon to make when they encounter other people. For example, one can judge other people in terms of either what they do (achievement) or what they are (ascription). American society places a great emphasis on achievement, whereas medieval society was more concerned about whether a person was born an aristocrat, a peasant, a Christian, or a Jew. Another basic choice is between treating people according to abstract and general rules like the law (universalism) and treating them according to personal relationships like friendship (particularism). Societies can thus be described according to their combinations of basic values. In this regard, Parsons believed that the United States can be summed up as achievement-oriented and universalis- tic; Imperial China was achievement-oriented but particularistic; Germany is ascriptive and universalistic; and Latin America is ascriptive and particularistic. In the tabular form: Achievement Ascription Universalism United States Germany Particularism China Latin America Social Change The social system changes by either "differentiation" or "de-differentiation." This means that the division of labor can increase, with structures be-</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming more specialized in their functions, or decrease, with structures taking on more functions. The idea is a familiar one in economics: The self-supporting family farm is part of a system with little division of labor, whereas the modern economy of specialized food producers, clothing manufacturers, railroads, and so forth, has a high division of labor. Extending the idea to the entire social structure and bearing in mind the functions that are served by the family, the church, and so on, one can place societies on a continuum from undifferentiated to highly differentiated. At the low end of the spectrum are primitive tribes, in which the kinship system is the only social structure, filling all the various functions itself. At the other end are the complex set of specialized social organizations found in the modern United States. In sociology we find this idea worked out with increasingly greater sophistication in Comte, Spencer, Durkheim, and Parsons. As the division of labor increases, societies increase their efficiency and their productivity, just as the mass-production factories produce more with less cost than the old handicraft industries. Following Durkheim, Parsons noted that the cultural system changes along with the social structure; as societies become more complex and differentiated, the culture becomes "upgraded"—more abstract, more generalized. This is Parsons' explanation of the trend (described in Chapter 7) from particularistic, local, nature gods in primitive religions to the universalistic world religions and, finally, to the modern, transreligious, ethical universe. But differentiation also creates problems; in particular, the more division of labor between the specialized parts, the more pressure there is for integrating the system. In economics this means that the industrial division of labor has to be integrated by a new monetary and credit system. In societal change, increasing differentiation creates problems that must be solved by political means—by state-supported education, welfare, old-age insurance, and so forth. What causes societies to change, to move from one level of differentiation to another? Science, for one thing; economic growth, for another. New technological inventions, like the steam engine, the gasoline-powered automobile, and the radio, have changed the ways in which people produce and move goods, transport themselves, and communicate, and they have thus set off changes in human organizations with ramifications throughout the interconnected web of the social structure. Economic growth brings more and more of the world into one large division of labor, promoting greater specialization at all points and calling forth new agencies to coordinate things. Another cause of change is imperfect integration of the parts, due to prior change. Thus, as the Parsonian sociologist Neil Smelser has shown, the early industrial revolution in England put a great strain on the old family system; since workers in factories could no longer appropriately keep their children with them and have them help while they worked, the state eventually had to take over responsibility for the children by setting up schools and prohibiting child labor. The family was thus transformed into its functionally appropriate modern nuclear form.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These are all short-run changes, which come into play only once the processes of scientific discovery and economic change have begun. To explain the long-run changes Parsons draws on Weber's theory of history (presented in Chapter 7). The main difference is that Parsons omits political struggle, which was the main engine of change for Weber, and concentrates instead on changes in religious beliefs. Since Parsons sees societies as determined by their fundamental value systems, changes in values are the prime movers of social change, and charismatic leaders—the great prophets of antiquity, Saint Paul, Martin Luther, John Calvin—are the key figures who set forth new values. But the cultural tradition is in the long run more important than the individual leaders, since they can only develop the potentialities already inherent in the tradition. PARSONS' RELIGIOUS SOCIOLOGY Parsons' students can remember him lecturing on the sociology of religion to a roomful of Catholic nuns, Buddhist priests in their saffron robes, bearded rabbis, and Harvard undergraduates in Levis and tweed jackets, capturing the cultural history of the world into one long sequence: Parsons moved from the animistic religions of remote antiquity to the "instrumental activism" of the Hebrew prophets and their vengeful almighty God; on through early Christianity and the medieval struggles to separate church from state, and thence to Martin Luther's abolition of the monkhood, which upgraded the obligations of Christianity and made monks of us all; to Calvin's puritanical insistence that the world be as righteous as the kingdom of heaven, carried to the new world by the Calvinistic settlers of Massachusetts Bay who laid down the value system of the United States; the gradual secularization of that Protestant ethic into an achievement orientation that tolerated all religions and set loose the economic and social changes of the mightiest nation in the history of the earth; until at last one could see cultural history devolving down through the ages to the very man standing before us, this son of a Calvinist preacher and heir (his very name told us) to a long line of preachers, holding our rapt attention with the culminating system in which cultural history at last comes to full self-understanding. Spencer was dwarfed by the performance. It called to mind the visionary giants of the past: Hegel, Dante, and Thomas Aquinas. Indeed, Talcott Parsons' sociological system is an adaptation of the traditional Christian worldview to the sophisticated requirements of modern secular thought. Unlike most contemporary social scientists, Parsons believed in free will—a voluntaristic conception of humankind in society, as he put it in The Structure of Social Action. To this extent he breaks with the hard-nosed positivistic attempt to bring humankind under the deterministic canons of physical science. At the same time he holds that social order and predictable behavior are not only real but necessary, just as Christian</p>
<p class="calibre1">theology maintains both that humankind is free and that God is nevertheless all-determining. Parsons solves the religious paradox in sociological terms: Individuals are free to choose, but they always choose in the presence of other individuals who are also, free. They can act together in harmony because they develop values that tell them what things are worth pursuing and norms that set the rules under which they pursue those ends. People do not have to live up to the values and norms of their society, but they find it best for themselves, as well as for others, if they do. The norms that develop always must have some rewards built into them, so that people reward each other for doing what they must do. Like the utilitarians on back to Adam Smith, Parsons sees the world as held together by an invisible hand, a system in which people exchange things with each other. The exchanges are sometimes economic—pay for work, money for goods—but Parsons adds a Freudian dimension to make the exchange a moral matter as well as a material one. People trade not only goods but human contact and emotion—approval and disapproval, feelings of belonging, a sense of social solidarity. Thus, individuals who live up to the norms reap the rewards of feeling that they belong and are respected; those who do not conform'punish themselves by isolating themselves from human society. Parsons incorporates the old moral lesson into his sociology-. One can find happiness in being good, while evil is its own punishment—to be cut off from God (or society). The functional imperatives of society thus take the place of the Christian God. People do not have to live up to them, but if they do not, retribution swiftly follows as their world crumbles around them. Durkheim, the ultra- positivist, had debunked religion in the name of science by showing that God is but a symbolic representation of the moral order of society. Parsons, the American secularized theologian, turned up the other face of the argument with his claim that society is fundamentally a spiritual order. All humans basically acknowledge the claims of social order, no matter how much they rebel against its claims on them personally; individuals may steal, cheat, lie, and fight, but no one would want a world in which everyone did so, for then society would not exist. God in the end is stronger than the devil, and the devil himself knows it. Even force and violence ultimately contribute to this order. Like Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor, Parsons sees that power is necessary to enforce the claims of society on the individual. The wielders of power—the kings and the generals and the politicians—may personally profit a great deal, but without them society would crumble into a chaos that no one would want. Thus humans are selected to do God's will, whether they know it or not. Parsons incorporates not only the traditional Christian moral vision, but its optimistic nineteenth-century adaptation, liberal evolutionism. Society is not only becoming more productive and more powerful as it develops, it is also becoming more just. As the value system has shifted from ascription to achievement, from particularism to universalism, human beings are becom-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing more humanitarian. Torture, public executions, cruelty to the insane, the burning of witches—all these have gradually disappeared in the more modern societies. The sense of universal brotherhood has spread—from a society in which one trusted only one's relatives to the rise of feelings of national identification and now (optimistically) beyond nations to all humankind. Politics, too, has become increasingly participatory and just. In a list of evolutionary stages through which societies must pass if they are to become increasingly differentiated (and thereby more modern and more powerful), Parsons rather ethnocentrically includes democracy as a necessity for all truly modern systems. Whether or not some individuals want to allow democracy, it is the price they must pay if they want progress. In politics as elsewhere, Parsons' God manifests itself increasingly throughout history. PARSONS' CONTRIBUTIONS Parsons' liberal optimism betrays its weaknesses most clearly in his treatment of politics. Fascism, Parsons felt, was a transitional phenomenon caused by the struggle of a rationalized economy and a tradition-breaking scientific culture against an old world of family, community, and politics that had not yet adjusted. Parsons never took seriously Durkheim's fears that an extremely rationalized society would destroy social solidarity, or Weber's warnings that modern bureaucratic organizations eliminate responsible social leadership and condemn us to a world of bureaucratic drift. Like the early British liberals, Parsons held far too gentlemanly a view of politics, closing his eyes to the realities of power struggles where the interests of the various factions by no means coincide with the interest of the collective system. By concentrating entirely on the functional aspects of society, Parsons was powerless to explain the vast realm of phenomena that are not functional. Like his predecessors, Parsons had his gaze too much on the heights to fully understand what went on in the mundane world below. The major fault in Parsons' method is overabstraction. When Durkheim identified the collective conscience, he was talking about something that real groups of people feel when they come together, not about a big invisible balloon in the sky neatly covering the boundaries of the United States or China or some other country and labeled "value system." In the same way, Parsons reified the very general idea of a social system and identified it with whole states, not noticing how many different, relatively nonconnect- ed groups there are within every state, oblivious of or in conflict with each other. His error was in jumping from some aspects of reality that fit the metaphor to the assumption that they all do. Societies sometimes draw themselves together after a war, but quite as often they break up into new societies; the fundamental assumption of dynamic equilibrium is a variable to be explained, not a universal process to be taken for granted. The path forward from Durkheim's insight is not to make it more abstract, but to ex-</p>
<p class="calibre1">amine particular groups of people as they create the various kinds of collective conscience found at a tea party or a diplomatic reception, or in the corridors of a mental institution. Erving Goffman, as we shall see in Chapter 13, is the man who took up this latter task. Parsons' major contributions to sociology have been to uphold the high theoretical tradition and to ask the fundamental questions in an era when few social scientists were even aware that they were there to ask. He carried out part of the crucial integration of the great insights of Durkheim and Freud and showed some of the places where Weber fits into the emerging grand pattern. If functionalist explanations fall far short of incorporating the realities of human conflict and explaining the links between the functions an institution serves and the fact of its existence, they nevertheless sometimes cast a spotlight on the manifold interconnections of the social structure. Finally, not the least of Parsons' contributions is one for the twenty-first century: He has preserved our knowledge of free will and human consciousness as facts until the time that our theories become adequate to explain those mysteries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER TWELVE Hitler's Shadow: Michels, Mannheim, and Mills The decade of the 1930s posed the biggest shock to popular worldviews since the French Revolution of the 1790s. The unimaginable happened: Fascism came to power in Germany. An authoritarian, antimodern, antisci- entific, antirational, and antidemocratic movement, it negated all the ideals human beings had thought were in the ascendant for almost 200 years. Moreover, fascism was not simply a conspiracy of a few backward aristocrats, but a popular mass movement with literally millions of enthusiastic followers, and it sprang up in one of the most advanced industrial nations in the world. The 1917 revolution in Russia that brought the Communists to power for the first time had already made a dent in the complacency of Western liberal beliefs, but not so great as the Fascist success. After all, at least one sector of Western thought had been predicting such a revolution for quite a while, and in any event it could be brushed off as a modernizing effort in a backward country. One way or another the Russian Revolution could be assimilated to existing modes of thought—but fascism! Until it happened, no one would even have thought it possible. And having happened, it required explanation, something that has dominated our attention ever since. The inferences drawn have not all been sound, but we have been thinking in Hitler's shadow for forty years. Fascism did not appear out of nowhere, of course. Currents of anti- Semitism and antirationalism had been welling up since the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1922 Benito Mussolini, a former Socialist leader, took power in Italy after marching on Rome with his black-shirted followers, promising an end to economic and political disorder. And in 1923 Adolf Hitler began his slow climb to prominence in an abortive Putsch organized in the beer halls of Munich. Fascism built up strength slowly and in full public view before Hitler was named chancellor in 1933. People of reason had plenty of time to listen to it and react to it, but for the most part they found it so incompatible with their assumptions that they dismissed its importance. 220</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Marxists, especially after the onset of the worldwide economic depression of 1929, made an effort to explain fascism as the death agony of capitalism. But why this death agony, so unlike what Marx seemed to predict? Moreover, the issue seemed not so much an economic one—Hitler was successful enough in restoring economic prosperity once he took power in Germany—as something more deeply rooted in people's social nature that made them respond irrationally to crises, whether economic or otherwise. Marxism had shared the rationalistic assumptions of the nineteenth century, but these seemed no longer to apply. Marxism was breaking down in other ways as well. The Russian experiment in Soviet Utopia was going badly. The power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky had turned into a reign of terror by the 1930s, and the world was treated to the spectacle of old revolutionary leaders being tried and executed on charges of treason and finally of the exiled Trotsky lying dead in his villa in Mexico with an assassin's pickax through his brain. Stalin's dictatorship wiped out most of the optimism of the left; Hitler's brought the rest of the world to its feet in shock. Science and industry were moving onward toward the innovations of television, the jet plane, and the atom bomb, but the old hopefulness was gone. The world suddenly lost its meaning, and modern individuals found themselves wandering amid their material creations like characters in the novels of Franz Kafka. World War I already had begun to foreshadow this disillusionment with human rationality. It was a war that everyone, after the first spasms of patriotic enthusiasm, agreed was senseless—begun over a trivial issue in diplomacy, unstoppable once the mammoth machinery of warfare was set in motion, dragging on in the trenches of the Western Front at the cost of millions of lives, and ending by having settled nothing. It was during and after World War I that the characteristic disillusionment of modern literature became the universal outlook of thinking individuals, spread by the Dadaists, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, and the rest of the "lost generation." Disillusionment had been particularly acute on the left, for the Socialists had explicitly hoped to be able to prevent such wars. Wars are fought for the benefit of the ruling classes, they asserted, but it is the workers who die in the ranks; hence it would be absurd for the workers of one country to kill their class brothers and sisters for the benefit of their bosses. The Socialist movement, grown to considerable strength among the workers of Germany and France, was counted on to maintain peace. But when war was declared in 1914, after the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the Socialists for the most part fell in line with the prevailing mood of chauvinism. The Social Democrats in Germany, the strongest working-class party on the Continent, threw their support squarely behind the kaiser by voting to provide the emergency war funds for the army.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MICHELS' IRON LAW OF OLIGARCHY At least one man was not surprised by this unprincipled turnabout. He was Robert Michels (1876-1936), a young historian who had been unable to get a job in the German university system, despite the recommendation of Max Weber, because he was a member of the Social Democrats. Michels had participated extensively in party activities and had come to the conclusion that the Socialists did not live up to their own ideals. Although the party advocated democracy, it was not internally democratic itself. The revolutionary Marxism of the speeches at conventions and on the floor of the Reichstag was just a way of whipping up support among the workers, while the party leaders built a bureaucratic trade union and party machine to provide sinecures for themselves. Michels' analysis appeared in 1911 in a book called Political Parties. The phenomenon of party oligarchy was quite general, stated Michels; if internal democracy could not be found in an organization that was avowedly democratic, it would certainly not exist in parties which did not claim to be democratic. This principle was called the Iron Law of Oligarchy, and it constitutes one of the great generalizations about the functioning of mass- membership organizations, as subsequent research has borne out. The Iron Law of Oligarchy works as follows: First of all, there is always a rather small number of persons in the organization who actually make decisions, even if the authority is formally vested in the body of the membership at large. The reason for this is purely functional and will be obvious to anyone who has attended a public meeting or even a large committee session. If everyone tries to have a say (as happens especially in the first blush of enthusiasm when a new, democratically controlled organization is created), then in fact nothing gets done. The discussion goes on at great length without even covering all the necessary issues, until finally most people leave or keep quiet and let a few persons present their plans. Before long, the group has delegated to a few of its members the authority to prepare plans and to carry them out, while most members confine themselves to formally selecting and approving plans presented to them. Second, says Michels, the leaders who have this delegated authority tend to take on more power than the members who selected them. Once in power (whether this is an elected office or a purely informal leadership role), they tend to remain there for a long time and become relatively impervious to influences from below. New leaders enter their ranks primarily by being selected or co-opted from above by the old leaders, rather than by rising on their own from below. The reason for this is partly functional and partly because of the way resources of power are distributed in an organization. The leaders are a much smaller group than the rank and file, but they have the advantage of being better organized. The members as a whole come together (if at all) only at occasional meetings or elections, but the leaders are in constant contact with each other. The leaders tend to form a</p>
<p class="calibre1">united, behind-the-scenes, informal group, for it is much easier for them to make plans, carry out programs, and iron out disagreements in private personal negotiations than under the parliamentary rules of open meetings. But since the leaders operate in close contact with each other, out of the sight of the general membership, they tend to develop their own ways of looking at things. They are "insiders" who have a sophisticated view of how things are done, how bargains are struck, how strategies are formed. They know the ropes, and new leaders must become initiated into their world; hence they are selected from above, rather than projected from below. Third, the leaders gradually develop values that are at odds with those of the members. Michels here applies the principle of Marx and Weber that men's outlooks are determined by their social positions. The social positions of party leaders are fundamentally different from the positions of mere party members, since their experiences of participating in the organization are different. For the ordinary member, the organization is something he or she belongs to and participates in from time to time, but it is not usually the center of his or her life. Members expect their union to fight for their interests and their values, but that is about all. The leader's position is different. For that person, the organization is usually a ftill-time job, or at least a major part of his or her life. Especially if the organization is big and powerful enough to have paid officials, these officers receive money, power, and prestige from their positions, and often a chance to belong to a higher realm of other elites. The union leader gets to associate with corporation officials; the Socialist deputy sits in the legislature with other persons of power. It is not surprising, says Michels, that the values of such leaders become subtly corrupted. The leader becomes less concerned with the interests of the rank and file or the ideology of the party and more concerned with staying in office. Leaders become conservative, in the sense that they want only to preserve their organization and not jeopardize it on risky ventures, even if the organization's ideals call for it. But doesn't this corruption of the leaders bring them into conflict with their followers? It sometimes does, says Michels, but the leadership has the upper hand in such struggles. Unless the membership is extremely upset about something—and maybe not even then—they are unlikely to mobilize their numbers to displace the leadership. For power in the organization goes to those who control its administrative resources, and these are in the hands of the leaders. They are better organized than the membership. They are better informed, for they are in constant contact with the latest developments both inside and outside the organization, and they can use this knowledge, which is usually kept secret among themselves, to attack their opponents as ill-informed and unrealistic. They control the communications within the organization: distributing its newsletter, calling its meetings, setting its agendas, making its official reports. They have full time to devote to organization business and organization politics, whereas their opponents are usually part-time amateurs; the leaders also have the finances, the staff assistance, the contacts, and the know-how.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And finally, they have the legitimacy of being the existing leadership who can claim to represent the organization, whereas their opponents can be called "factions" and "splitters" who represent only themselves and who aid the organization's enemies by creating internal dissension. The united leadership, then, can wield power out of all proportion to its numbers because it controls the material and ideological resources of the organization. Michels provides a sort of mini-Marxism of class conflict and the weapons that enable one class to prevail, only his setting is a single organization rather than the whole society. But Michels had no hopes that history would ever reverse this distribution of power resources. As long as we have large- scale organizations, these consequences are inevitable. "Who says organization," stated Michels, "says oligarchy." Michels' analysis was remarkably perceptive. Subsequent research has revealed that the dispersion of power away from the membership and into the hands of the leaders who control the administrative apparatus occurs in all sorts of formally democratic membership organizations—in political parties all over the world, trade unions, clubs, legislatures, charities, PTAs, and professional associations ranging from the American Medical Association to the American Sociological Association. The Iron Law of Oligarchy is not, of course, an outright declaration that members never have any control of their organizations. Theories that state such absolutes are usually wrong, for reality is more complex and variable than that. Properly understood, Michels' theory tells how the different positions in an organization shape the interests of their holders and give them certain organizational weapons that they can use in the struggle with others for control of the organization. It does not state that the leaders are always completely corrupted or that they always have their way. The history of political parties in America illustrates the point nicely. The Republican and Democratic parties in America, especially the latter, have always been strongly influenced by party bosses and professional politicians, from the spoils system of Andrew Jackson through the recent presidential campaigns. The techniques of organizational control that Michels describes are well illustrated in almost any political campaign. Nevertheless, some reforms have occurred from time to time; some politicians occasionally arise who make more than a token appeal to popular demands; and long-entrenched party bosses are sometimes displaced. Michels' theory, then, is not a matter of absolutes, but of variations, of which he described the most typical outcome. Subsequent research has shown us that the threat of organizational oligarchy, although always present, varies with the type and setting of the organization. The most oligarchic associations are those that have a very numerous and dispersed membership and large-scale centralized administrative machinery for the leaders to control. The less oligarchic organizations are those that depend on frequent participation by their members and that compete with other associations for their members' support. Michels' position on the chances of real democracy is pessimistic, but we have since seen that there are at least some possibilities of overcoming oligarchy. '</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michels' theory has been fruitfully applied in yet another direction. The American sociologist Philip Selznick has shown that the same sort of processes can be found in government agencies in his classic analysis of the New Deal's TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) project to help the poor farmers of Appalachia. Such bureaucracies are not like political parties, of course, since they do not claim to be controlled by their membership, but rather by the elected officials who head the government. But there are similar processes in both. The bureaucracy's members come to take on distinctive interests and outlooks from running the organization, which begin to cut them adrift from the official purposes of the legislators who originally created it. Like party officials, the bureaucrats become more interested in having the organization survive and prosper than in meeting any particular ideals. The TVA, for example, soon gave in to powerful conservative interests of the wealthier southern farmers and neglected the poorer farmers and the public as a whole. The liberal rhetoric of the organization's ideals continued, says Selznick, but only as a protective cover, analogous to the radical speeches of Michels' German party leaders. The overall picture is of a world of organizations that control their own members, rather than vice versa. Bureaucracies and political parties alike operate according to the principle of self-protection and self-aggrandizement, regardless of what happens to the interests of the larger society or to the organization's own enunciated goals. Such ideals float over the surface, but serve only to cloud our eyes to the organizational realities below. We think the social world is rational and purposeful, but the appearance is deceptive, and things are not really under any individual's control. His pessimism confirmed by the Social Democrats' support of World War I, Michels finally took a university position in Italy. The German academic system would not accept him in any case. When Mussolini's Fascist movement arose, Michels gave it his support. For Michels, its open disavowal of democracy was at least a sign of honesty, and he was convinced that if democracy was impossible, the only answer lay in strong leaders. MANNHEIM'S THEORY OF SOCIAL RELATIVISM Michels thus disappeared from the intellectual scene, but the questions he raised did not. Their implications were drawn out most thoroughly by another German, Karl Mannheim (1893-1947). Trained in sociology and philosophy, Mannheim became a professor of sociology at Frankfurt University in the late 1920s. Nearby was the first research institute for sociology to exist in Germany. Its funds came from a millionaire manufacturer, the father of one of the university students. It is doubtful that he knew quite what he was endowing, for the Frankfurt Institute became a crucible for the ideas of Weber, Freud, and a new revival of Marx. Around it gathered a remarkable collection of men, known as the "Frankfurt school," most of whom were to make their marks on social research in America after the Nazis forced them out of Germany. They included Theodore Adorno, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guiding spirit of the research for The Authoritarian Personality; the prominent neo-Freudian Erich Fromm; the leading sociologist of literature Leo Lowenthal; Karl Wittfogel, who reformulated Marxist analysis of Eastern societies in Oriental Despotism; the Marxist philosopher Max Horkheimer; and Herbert Marcuse, the chief neo-Marxist prophet of the mid-twentieth century. In this atmosphere appeared Mannheim, the most conservative figure on the scene and the most eminent. Mannheim first stated his position in 1929 in Ideology and Utopia. His stance was essentially that of a liberal trying to find a place for his values in the modern world. These were the beliefs that reason and democracy were the best defenses of human welfare, freedom, and culture. But these values were threatened, and Mannheim squarely faced the threat: Nothing was truly believable anymore. No values were certain; no truths were sure. What had happened was that human beings had penetrated beneath their old assumptions—first, of religious dogmatism, then, of secular humanism—to recognize the social relativism of ideas. Mannheim did not invent this relativism himself. Its most popular expositor in the 1920s was the German philosopher Max Scheler, but it went back through Nietzsche, Marx, and Hegel and ultimately had its roots in the Enlightenment effort to bring all assumptions under the test of scientific reasoning. To paraphrase Mannheim, we have come to see that there is no such thing as "truth" or "value" all by itself, but that these are always somebody's ideas. Moreover, the individuals who think these ideas do not confront the universe in the abstract; rather, they occupy particular positions that shape their outlooks. We can trace these influences on human beings' ideas more easily, says Mannheim, if we realize that most individuals do not originate any ideas at all, but just repeat what they have heard from others. The basic ideas of any social period come from a few elite groups of thinkers. If we look at the social positions that these intellectuals occupy, we can see the determinants of their thought. For example, the only intellectuals of the European Middle Ages were priests and monks. They were organized in the Catholic Church, which claimed universal spiritual domination throughout Europe. Accordingly, their ideas took the form of a universal system of theology and philosophy, which claimed to reduce the entire world to order and which was dogmatically asserted to be true. This ideal was found, for example, in the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. This age of absolute faith began to break down when the Church began to lose its monopoly over the livelihoods of intellectuals. This came about first from the various reformations and schisms in the Church, then from the industrial revolution, which created a new, literate, middle-class audience. Intellectuals could now make a living by selling books and articles on an open market. This in turn meant that there was a competition of ideas, leading eventually to the recognition that there were innumerable points of view on the world. The free market of ideas created the philosophy of relativism. But then is nothing true? What about the methods of natural science, which slowly build up a body of knowledge, verified by experiment and re-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fined by generations of critical reasoning that holds good irrespective of time and place? Mannheim paid little attention to scientific knowledge, it is true, but this was because he considered it irrelevant to his main concerns. He was interested in thought about society and especially about politics, and it is for such thought that social relativism is especially crucial. Political beliefs always combine our analysis of what exists in the world with our values of right and wrong. Concepts like "democracy" and "freedom" have this twofold nature; they state not merely how things work, which is the aim of natural science, but how they ought to work. The question of what the right political system is, then, is not amenable to the methods of natural science—at least not in any simple fashion. But this was what the liberal tradition of the Enlightenment had proposed to do—to find the right way to conduct human affairs through the use of reason, rather than by relying on dogma or force. As we shall see, Mannheim did not want to give up this hope of the eighteenth-century thinkers, but his reason told him that the issue of relativism must be faced before it would be possible to say if anything of this hope could be salvaged. Political thought, says Mannheim, falls into five main camps: bureaucratic conservatism, traditional (historical) conservatism, bourgeois liberalism, socialism, and fascism. Bureaucratic Conservatism. The position taken by administrators. Its principal tenet might be formulated as "Don't rock the boat." It declares that there are no issues other than technical questions of how to get things done and does not want to take the trouble of asking what should be done and why. It simply wants to continue as usual with existing operations. Bureaucrats, says Mannheim, try to reduce all questions of politics to questions of administration. This attitude is found among administrators and technical experts everywhere; it deals with questions of value by denying that they exist, although of course it contains the implicit value of keeping the bureaucratic machine running, and as such constitutes the ideology of the bureaucrats. Traditional Conservatism. The viewpoint of privileged aristocrats, wealthy landowners, and established clergy. It declares, contrary to the bureaucratic ideology, that history cannot be controlled by plans or decisions. Such conservatives are fond of naturalistic metaphors: Society develops over the centuries like a spreading tree or a flowing river, and nothing anyone can do will have much effect on the natural course of events. Needless to say, this argument for respecting tradition is made by those who are most favored by what the past has wrought up to now; it is those who are sitting in the highest branches of the tree who extol its supposedly harmonious growth. Bourgeois Liberalism. This philosophy declares that human beings do have the power to reason, to plan, to decide their fate. It points out the flaw in the conservative argument: that not everyone benefits equally from the tra-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ditional opinions on what is good for all; accordingly, the best form of government is that in which all the people, or their representatives, assemble to decide their common policy. Truth is not found merely in dogma and tradition, but is something that individuals may arrive at by rational discourse. Socialist Thought. This goes one step further and points out that human beings not only have intellectual disagreements but also have real conflicts of interest. Government, even democratic government, is not just a debating society in which people decide on the best interests of all; it upholds the laws and property of an economic system that favors certain individuals and enchains others. In short, Socialist thought exposes liberalism as an ideology averting people's eyes from their material situation, at the same time that material advantages determine who will be able to take part in the government debate. Truth, then, can be revealed only by the revolutionary class, the workers, who can strip away the bourgeois ideology because they have nothing to gain from it. Fascism. Finally, Fascism emerges after the lessons of socialism begin to sink in. Liberal democracy is unmasked as ideology, but socialism soon undergoes the same fate. There is nothing transcendental or compelling about the values of socialism, it is soon discovered. They represent only the interests of one more class or one more set of politicians, and all their talk about history being on their side is revealed to be a purely ideological claim. Fascism, says Mannheim, emerges from this sort of total relativism. Its reasoning is: If you can't be right, you can at least be on the winning side. Cynicism about the possibility of attaining political truth leads to opportunism and the worship of power for its own sake. Fascism is the ideology of the unsuccessful, the marginal politicians and intellectuals. It finds its followers among those who, for whatever reasons, want to return to dogmatic certainties; in a time of chaos, there are many who would sacrifice everything for guaranteed law and order. If each of these positions is determined by the social interests of its respective social groups—bureaucrats, aristocrats, middle-class entrepreneurs, workers, and opportunistic ideologues—which position is right? How can we decide among them? Mannheim gives two answers. First, he points out, these philosophies were largely formulated by intellectuals, who then peddled their ideas to the classes most favorable to them. The intellectuals themselves were a motley group, recruited from many classes of society. This shows that the position of the intellectual is a distinctive one, detached from any social class and hence potentially attachable to any. Marx, for example, came from a bourgeois family but attached himself to the camp of the workers. The "free-floating intelligentsia," then, is in a position to transcend any particular class interests. If they can attach themselves to any class, they can also attach themselves to none and devote</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves to synthesizing the insights gained by each of the above ideologies. Out of their particular positions, the intellectuals should be able to formulate a general one. But what can this position be? Mannheim's second answer derives from a historical view of values. No values are absolute, he says. What is believed in one age will not be believed in another, and each group has its own interests and outlook on life. Any group that tries to impose its values on others by declaring them universally valid is committing both an intellectual error and an exercise of coercion. The dilemma arises because we are always making choices of action, and hence we cannot do without values, be they explicit or implicit. But at least it is possible, says Mannheim, to be aware of this and to avoid beliefs that are inappropriate to the times. For example, the traditional conservative ideology which spoke of the world as a God-ordained order, in which nobles controlled and protected their serfs like fathers their children (and God his world), had some relevance to a medieval society. It becomes an ideology only when the modern landowner tries to keep down the wages of his farm workers by using the same arguments, even though he now operates in a market economy in which his main concern is profit. Mannheim's criterion, then, is that ideas should be in harmony with historical development. We cannot have absolute truths and absolute rights and wrongs, but we can at least demand that ideas be realizable in action in the world as it currently exists. Mannheim makes a partial exception for those political ideas he calls "Utopias," which he sees as preparing the way for a new stage of society. Thus, the Rousseauist ideals of freedom were a Utopia of the eighteenth century, but they foreshadowed the bourgeois society of the nineteenth century and hence could be seen as serving some function in the light of history. If we look back at Mannheim's list of the five main political ideologies, we see that with one exception, they form a historical sequence. The exception is bureaucratic conservatism. Ever since bureaucracies began to develop in the seventeenth century, they had taken an anti-ideological, antipoliti- cal stance: Times change, and reasons for action change too, but bureaucracies go on and on. The other four ideologies fall into a historical progression: First, traditional conservatism reigned in the premodern society of aristocrats and priests. This was challenged by the bourgeois liberalism of the rising businessperson, which accordingly became most salient during the formative years of the industrial revolution. Advancing industrialism created the working class and its characteristic ideology of socialism. And, finally, modern society went into a period of crisis, caused by the failure of the previous ideologies to correctly express the nature of the modern world. The result was fascism. But fascism was not the end of history, at least from Mannheim's standpoint. It was rather the ideology of chaos and frustration, and it simply embraced the crisis rather than pointing to a way to resolve it. What was still lacking was a politics appropriate for modern society, and this Mannheim</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself proposed to provide. This was the aim of his next book, Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction (1935). MANNHEIM'S POLITICS FOR MODERN SOCIETY Mannheim begins with an idea that has become familiar in modern liberalism: We have come to the end of laissez-faire in economics. Economic freedom for businesspeople was important during the nineteenth century as they struggled to free the market from traditional restrictions and thus to build up modern industrial society. But now that the free-market system has won out, and industrialism is an operating system, it must be controlled to keep it from destroying us. A planned economy, directed by the government through monetary and fiscal controls, has become necessary to avoid catastrophic depressions, inflation, unemployment, and other ills. Similarly, says Mannheim, we have had a laissez-faire philosophy in social and political matters. This has been the characteristic ideology of the bourgeois period, when the model of the individual businessperson and his or her private property influenced people to think of themselves as independent and self-sustaining individuals, fashioning their own fates and requiring nothing of society except the freedom to go their own ways. But when the interactions of human beings in modern society produce seemingly irreconcilable conflicts (for example, class conflict, whether in unionized or revolutionary form), the individualistic philosophy provides no way out. We are left in chaos until people begin to turn to fascism, which promises to impose order by sheer force. But fascism does not solve the underlying problem; it only buries it under totalitarian repression. Just as a sort of Keynesian strategy must be applied in the economic sphere, Mannheim declares that we can have the benefits of modern society only by the creation of planning in the social sphere. The social and political ills of modern society, as distinct from its economic problems, Mannheim finds to be caused by two major trends: the principles of fundamental democratization and of increasing interdependence. There has been a seemingly irreversible trend to include more and more of the populace in political life. Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this in the 1830s, and by Mannheim's time it was becoming taken for granted, just as today we automatically assume it will happen in the new nations of the Third World. But, says Mannheim, fundamental democratization in the sense of political participation does not automatically lead to increased freedom and an improved political life for everyone. This impression was given by the first stages of democratization in the early nineteenth century, when the industrial revolution brought the well-educated and business-trained middle class into politics. As they won the vote and the right to hold office, they brought with them their characteristic rationalism. This gave a sense of improvement over the old traditionalism, an optimistic feeling that public affairs were now to be settled with intelligence and humaneness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The later period of industrialization, however, mobilized the rest of the populace, and their entry into politics began to reverse the earlier effects. As urbanization, transportation, and the mass media made the lower classes (the small businessmen, workers, and farmers) a political force, they too won the franchise. But the effect was to lower the level of political debate to demagoguery: appeals to the emotions rather than to reason, to those who want quick, simplistic solutions rather than intelligent understanding of problems. Whereas the earlier phase of democracy enhanced the sense of freedom and rationality, the later phase of mass politics opened the way to potential dictatorship. At the same time, the different sectors of modern society have become increasingly interdependent. We now have a national economy rather than a set of local economies, an increasingly powerful national government, nationwide transport, and nationally centralized mass media, all of which bring people functionally together in very large numbers. One result of all this is that crises and conflicts in one part of society can no longer remain isolated, but quickly affect the rest of the system. By becoming more interdependent, we have become more vulnerable. Human beings are affected by financial affairs, political decisions, or cultural fads in far-off places; they become haunted by things they can neither see nor control. As things become more interdependent, the bases of power in society become more concentrated. The economy becomes dominated by a few far- flung corporations and by agencies of the central government that regulate money, credit, and trade. As society comes to depend on the smooth functioning of a complex and gigantic system of exchanges, the organizations that can regulate this activity become necessarily more important and more powerful. Our lives are thus affected by the decisions made in large bureaucracies, and those bureaucracies in turn are controlled by their technical experts and managers, who alone understand the complexities of the system. Thus, at the same time that the mass of humankind achieves the formal trappings of democracy, the situation puts real power in the hands of only a few. The same shift in power occurs in the military sphere with the rise of modern weapons. In earlier times, says Mannheim, sheer numbers had some weight; one individual was worth one gun. But this equality of force disappears with modern tanks, airplanes, and bombs, which make one centrally controlled military organization more powerful than large numbers of individually armed people. In short, power necessarily becomes more concentrated in modern society, thus increasing the chances of dictatorship. One might think from this argument that, at any rate, the centralized organizations arising in response to the increasing interdependence of the parts of society would provide the coordination necessary to prevent catastrophes. But no, says Mannheim, we can have large-scale organizations, with all their dangers to individual freedom, without gaining intelligent direction of social policy. This, in fact, constitutes the crucial problem of modern society, for which mass democracy and institutional interdependence provide only the background. Bureaucratic organizations provide rational control, says Mannheim, but there are two kinds of rationality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the one hand, there is substantial rationality, "an act of thought that reveals intelligent insight into the interrelations of events in a given situation." The model of substantial rationality is a person thinking realistically, calculating so that his or her actions reach their intended goals. On the other hand, there is functional rationality, "the fact that a series of actions is organized in such a way that it leads to a previously defined goal, every element in this series of actions receiving a functional position and role." Here Mannheim is talking about an industrial or administrative organization rather than a single person. The crucial difference is that whereas the individual's rationality involves his or her understanding of all his or her actions, the organization's rationality consists in reducing most of its members to cogs in a machine. Substantial rationality, then, is found only in the person at the head of the organization, whereas subordinates are made functionally rational by disciplining them to carry out orders, not to reflect on them. These two kinds of rationality, then, are not the same thing. Indeed, substantial rationality can undermine functional rationality, as when the organization's members or outsiders foul up its operations by standing back and criticizing or offering competing plans as to how things should be done. The conflict of these two principles is shown in World War I, says Mannheim, in the dispute between the German army and German diplomats and political leaders. The latter soon saw that Germany could not win the war because it was isolated against the rest of the world, and hence the only (substantially) rational course was to negotiate for peace. The army, however, was organized as a highly efficient bureaucracy, and its members were trained to think only in terms of how to carry out war operations. They exhibited what Mannheim calls bureaucratic conservatism, the outlook that denies all policy questions in favor of "getting the job done." In the conflict between the two forms of rationality, the functional rationality of the military carried the day. Germany did not attempt to negotiate and eventually was crushed militarily. The same pattern, of course, has been seen many times over, most recently in the American military's attempt to treat the nuclear arms race as a purely technical question, quite apart from its moral or policy implications. Mannheim's theory comes down to this basic issue. Modern industrial society will necessarily consist of powerful, centralized bureaucracies, run by their elites. The only question is: Will it be an intelligent and humanistic elite or a shortsighted and irrational elite? Mannheim views advanced industrial society through the lenses of Weber's and Michels' theories, which see supposedly rational organizations blindly drifting, following the imperatives of their internal functioning regardless of their consequences for the larger society. Business corporations, government bureaucracies, political parties, the military, the police, all follow their own patterns of self-aggrandizement, regardless of the disasters they may lead us into. Thus, we come into the modern era of enormously concentrated social power, controlled by blind and irresponsible elites who cloak their irrationality with the out-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dated ideologies of liberalism. The result, says Mannheim, is bound to be crisis—economic depression, senseless war, domestic disillusionment, and panic. Here two other possibilities open up: Either the Fascists will gain control, with their irrational glorification of order at any price—and this will, in the end, lead to enormous oppression and destruction—or, and this was Mannheim's hope, the organizations of modern society will be gotten back under control by a new elite, trained in social science, who will provide a planned society. Mannheim gives no clear idea of what such a plan would be, but presumably it would take into account the interdependence of all the parts of society, the consequences of organizations that their own members could not see, and the ways in which individuals' emotions are channeled into aggression or sublimation. But if no plan yet exists, we must get to work on it, for these are the only choices: bumbling along in our network of powerful but unguided organizations and risking fascism whenever a crisis arises, or instituting planning. But what happens to freedom in a planned society? This was a key question for Mannheim, since freedom was the main value he set out to defend against the forces of modern society. His answer invokes the perspective of historical relativism. It is useless to talk about freedom in the abstract, says Mannheim. Each age has its own conception of freedom, based on its particular problems and possibilities. Earliest human societies are in the "stage of chance discovery." Their methods of dealing with the world consist of traditions, accidentally adopted and maintained because they work. This notion is like William Graham Sumner's concept of folkways. On this level of society, freedom means spontaneous physical action—the freedom to go where one pleases, to do what one wants when one wants to do it. The limitations on this freedom come primarily from the environment—wild animals, the weather, diseases, lack of food—which may keep human beings from being able to do everything they want. More advanced civilization has reached the "stage of invention." People have learned to reflect on their world, to develop tools, crafts, machines, businesses, factories, organizations. The new techniques and organizations free us from the hardships of nature, but in return we must give up much of our physical spontaneity. The self-discipline of work with tools and in cooperation with others gives us much control over the physical environment, but it forces us to change our concept of freedom: It is no longer physical freedom of movement that is important, but the freedom to make one's own fortune by using tools and building one's business. It is the freedom of the inventor and the entrepreneur. But if the stage of social inventions gives us control over the physical environment, it puts us at the mercy of the social environment. What good is formal freedom to choose one's own work, says Mannheim, to a worker who is at the mercy of the shifting trends of the labor market? Accordingly, we find ourselves at the dawn of the "stage of planning," in which we give</p>
<p class="calibre1">up the free activity of each entrepreneur and inventor to go his or her own way regardless of the consequences for others in return for a new sort of freedom: the freedom to control our social world instead of being controlled by it. Democracy can be preserved in planning by incorporating the safeguards and procedures of democracy into the plan itself. At least, such was Mannheim's hope. He had to be optimistic about planning, for he felt there was no other acceptable choice. What can we say about Mannheim's ideas in the light of the half-century since they were written? The Nazi regime, predictably enough, turned an enormous bureaucratic efficiency to the service of such irrational goals as destroying "the Jewish menace" and conquering the world, and eventually it perished from the response to its ill-calculated policies. Most modern societies have instituted economic controls, be they Socialist or Keynesian, which apparently serve to prevent the kind of economic crisis that brought the Nazis to power in the first place. But there remain other crises besides economic ones, especially those involving internal social conflicts and foreign wars, as well as societywide issues of the quality of life. In regard to these matters things remain much as they were in Mannheim's day. MODERN APPLICATIONS OF MANNHEIM'S THEORIES C. Wright Mills (1916-1962), the controversial, motorcycle-riding sociologist from Columbia University, made the most serious application of Mannheim's perspective in his analysis of power in America. Mills was a big, burly Texan, so full of energy that he even wrote standing up; he went through three marriages and wrote six major books before dying of a heart attack at the age of forty-six. His key work, The Power Elite (1956), gathered together the evidence to show that power has become highly centralized in all sectors of American society. The American economy, according to Mills, is dominated by a few hundred giant corporations, whose top executives and owners make up a national upper class. In politics the national government far outweighs state and local governments as the locus of crucial decisions, and within the government the executive branch initiates policies that the elected representatives in Congress have only the power to rubber-stamp. Mills felt that the military had become a third major power center, going its own way in carrying out a worldwide policy of war preparation and finding its own allies, especially in its suppliers in the corporate economy. Mills documented the "military-industrial complex" before that notion became popular. Mills' picture of America was widely challenged, especially his relegation of pluralistic competition to the secondary levels of local patronage politics and his conclusion that high government officials, military officers, and the corporate rich form a united power elite ruling America in their own interests. Much of this criticism was based on value judgments that saw nothing wrong with a state of affairs that Mills found reprehensible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of his critics were supporters of the cold-war policies of the 1950s that Mills felt were based only on the self-interest of a coalition of businesspeo- ple guarding their privileges and the military inflating their own importance and that threatened the world with nuclear catastrophe. Opinion has shifted more toward Mills since the 1960s. The Vietnam War provided a concrete example of how the momentum of a military bureaucracy is scarcely controlled by the rest of American society. We have discovered that the moral shock of the Eichmann trial, with its defense of concentration-camp slaughter as "just following orders," is not merely a historical relic of Mannheim's day, for Americans faced the same issue when functional rationality was applied to the extermination of Vietnamese peasants. If we understand what Mills was saying in the light of Mannheim's larger picture of modern society, many of the disputes centering around just what Mills meant by power fade into triviality. Mills was documenting Mannheim's theories of interdependence and centralization in American society and the resulting transfer of power from local politics and political parties to a set of bureaucratic elites. In this perspective it is of little importance just how united those elites are or how consciously they try to manipulate our society (although even on this point, recent research has documented the disproportionate influence of a socially coherent upper class on national politics). Indeed, of the three alternatives Mannheim provides for modern society—the bumbling planlessness of organizations' functional rationality, the irrationality of a Fascist dictatorship, or planning by an intelligent and humanistic elite—Mills clearly put America in the first category. He was not, as some of his critics charged, hankering romantically for the bygone days of agrarian democracy. He accepted the concentration of organizational power in America as historically inevitable and only wanted it put under the control of persons who were aware of its dangers and responsible to the people at large. In this perspective it appears that we are still more or less in the situation that Germany was in prior to the 1930s—bumbling through the nuclear arms race on the momentum of military organizations; drifting through our race conflict on the momentum of entrenched business interests, political parties, and government bureaucracies; allowing the police to exploit superstitions about psychedelic drugs and the youth culture for their own self-aggrandizement. Our situation remains what Mills called "organized irresponsibility"—and in the background, should current compromises fail too badly, are the incipient Fascist demagogues, with their slogans of nationalism and law and order. Only the existence of a controlled economy keeps at least the catalyst of a major depression from being a continuous danger. What about Mannheim's solution—planning? Mannheim was rather vague about exactly what to do, and since Mannheim few thinkers of independent stature have addressed the question. It is true that a group of social scientists, jealous of the success of economists in achieving a policy voice through the Council of Economic Advisers, have been clamoring for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Council of Social Science Advisers to offer policies on the overall state of society. Although the general theme is within the compass of Mannheim's hopes, these individuals have little of Mannheim's substantive insights into modern society or indeed of the knowledge accumulated by the major thinkers of the last century. Their proposals consist of little more than the old social-problems philosophy that has guided American sociology, without striking success, since its inception (see Chapter 4): Keep a survey team trained on ghetto "hot spots," and pour in a few more welfare dollars when the riot temperature is rising. This philosophy sounds much more like a well-known political strategy for domestic counterinsurgency than anything based on sociological knowledge. The mentality of the would-be planners at this point resembles that of the bureaucrat, who, as Mannheim said, reduces all policy questions to questions of technique and administration and blindly accepts and maintains the implicit values of the status quo. Indeed, Mannheim correctly pointed out that the greatest dangers to modern society come not from rebellious individuals at the bottom of the social structure, but from the irresponsible momentum of military, business, and government bureaucracies. If we are to have any sort of successful planning to preserve our freedoms, it must be directed first of all at controlling the military, the police, the corporations, the mass media, the self-inflating educational system, rather than being controlled by their blind self-aggrandizement. It is here that the advances of sociology can have their most important application. Only if all of us—politicians, bureaucrats, and ordinary citizens alike—become aware of the intrinsic dynamics of our organizations will we ever stand a chance of getting them under our control and giving the world, at last, a semblance of substantial rationality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Erving Goffman and the Theater of Social Encounters Sociology today bears a surface resemblance to many of the dominant ideals of modern America: It is hard-nosed, quantitative, scientific, and practical-minded. Like technical experts behind, say, the atom bomb or a cost- accounting system, sociologists seem immersed in their statistics and their computer programs, oblivious to the human realities behind numbers and abstractions. Yet it would be a mistake to take the obvious, publicly visible side of sociology for the whole of the discipline, just as it would be wrong to conclude from the overwhelming impact of modern technology that we have become a nation of robots. The robots are here, to be sure, but the human element keeps reappearing alongside them. In American society there has been a youthful generation pushing for a cultural revolution in political ideals and in personal behavior; and in sociology, there has been the movement of radical empiricists whose most representative figure is the enigmatic Erving Goffman. Goffman's sociology might well be called the sociology of the forgotten. Embarrassment, uneasiness, self-consciousness, awkward situations, faux pas, scandals, mental illness—these are his subjects. His colleagues and students have begun to map out the whole underside of society: drug users, delinquents, con men, suicides, flying-saucer cultists, prisoners, topless dancers, and policemen on patrol. But the new sociology is more than a peek into the hidden and the bizarre. It follows one of the great strategies of the sociological method, first laid down by Emile Durkheim: Since society is ordered by norms that are usually unnoticed because they are taken for granted, the sociologist should concentrate on cases where the norms are broken in order to see clearly what they are and what forces act to uphold them. It is this strategy of revelation through disruption that Goffman has adopted: to look at the places where smooth-functioning public order breaks down, in order to see what normally holds it together. The method has produced insights that have begun to restructure sociological theory from top to bottom; we have come to see how social reality itself is constructed out of tacit understandings among people meeting face to face. 237</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even death itself has a meaning only from the way it is enacted in the omnipresent human theater. THE LABELING THEORY The first elements of the new approach to become popular in sociology appeared in a new theory concerning deviance. The sociologist of juvenile delinquency David Matza illustrates this theory and how it differs from its predecessors with a set of arguments. How does one become a delinquent? One theory pointed to a stressful environment: Sally's parents fought bitterly and finally were divorced; her mother took a job and was rarely at home; Sally underwent a great deal of stress, became pregnant, and in due time became an unwed mother and thereby a delinquent. A second theory was that there are delinquent subcultures, so that a person need not be individually disturbed to become deviant but may merely belong to a group in which deviance is "normal." The argument thus read: Sally's family lived in a lower-class neighborhood; Sally began to hang around with a "tough" gang, and as a result she became an unwed mother and a delinquent. The new theory, known as the labeling theory, argues that a majority of persons in supposedly delinquent areas do not become delinquent, that persons in "nice" neighborhoods may be just as likely to commit infractions but are less likely to be arrested or officially punished for them, and that it is the process of getting caught that transforms trivial offenses into the beginnings of a full-scale delinquent role. In terms of the labeling theory: Sally was in a parked car with her boyfriend one evening. After a few embraces she struggled free and insisted that it was time to go home. The boy was about to start the car when a police car rolled up, and a searchlight caught Sally buttoning her blouse. This was followed, through the rest of the night and the following days, by brusque commands, a ride in the squad car, fingerprinting, a personal search, a medical examination, calls to parents, charges of curfew violations and statutory rape, and lectures by police sergeants, juvenile court officials, probation officers, school administrators, and the family. As a result, Sally went out at the next opportunity and got pregnant. Goffman gave much impetus to labeling theory with his analysis of the inner workings of a mental hospital, reported in his book Asylums. Mental hospitals are supposed to cure mentally ill persons. Goffman decided to look at the matter from the inside and got himself into a large, state-run institution for a year—not as a patient (he felt the role would confine him too much to just one section of the hospital), but as the next best thing, recreation assistant, with his true identity known only to the hospital superintendent. Once inside, attracting attention neither as a patient nor as an authority-wielding attendant, he blended in so closely with his surroundings that his comings and goings were hardly discernible. "I could have sworn there were only fourteen in this room a minute ago," a puzzled attendant</p>
<p class="calibre1">would say. Through his brilliantly enacted plan Goffman collected the evidence for a radically unconventional insight: that mental illness is a social role just like any other and that the mental hospital is a place where people learn how to be properly mentally ill. The theoretical underpinnings of Goffman's analysis hinge on his model of the self. The self is a social product, asserts Goffman, taking up G. H. Mead's insights. A person is not an isolated thing, but an image carved out of the whole life space of his or her interactions with others. A being alone is an animal; only in the society of others does a person acquire essential humanness. Each person's self is a reflection of the responses of others, and each person gives others parts of himself in return. Society is like holding hands in a circle, says Goffman, in which each one gets back on the right hand what he or she gives with the left. Ordinarily, one derives one's feeling of self from acting with a variety of people in many contexts. But a mental hospital greatly simplifies the conditions of life: In place of a network of different relationships, one finds oneself in a world of only two social categories: patients, all of whom are considered basically flawed and incompetent, and staff, all of whom have freedoms patients are denied and the authority to control patients in major and minor ways. The hospital is large; bureaucratic exigencies require that large numbers of patients be fed, clothed, rested, exercised, watched, and— because of their lapses from ordinary social behavior—sometimes forced to bathe, be dressed, restrained from violence and destruction, and generally treated as persons whose selves carry no dignity or autonomy. Moreover, the hospital, as a place to keep patients away from normal society, is necessarily a "total institution"—the patient spends every hour of the day within the same walls, subject to the same monolithic controls, and facing the abiding scrutiny of a regular staff that keeps permanent records of patients' behavior. The social sources that reflect his or her self, then, are not only degrading but monolithic; they offer the patient no escape into privacy or to alternative audiences who know nothing of his or her shortcomings. Much of the bizarre behavior of inmates, including such acts as slobbering, cursing, defecating in their clothes, fighting, and withdrawing from any contact, can be seen as desperate devices out of an impoverished repertoire of actions to give some autonomy to the self. The formal organization of a mental hospital, then, by its very nature, creates many of the symptoms that it is designed to cure. The foregoing does not do justice to the many subtle and complex ways in which being mentally ill has been analyzed, by Goffman and others, as a social role rather than as inexplicable, random, and exotic behavior.1 The general form of analysis has been applied to many areas: to showing how 1Current research on the biochemical bases of some mental illness only adds to the complexity of the analysis, rather than eliminating social factors. Whatever the physiological process involved, all humans live in a social world, and even a person with a malfunctioning body shapes a self in relation to the social world around him or her. Later in this chapter we will discuss Goffman's suggestion of just what it means socially to define someone as mentally ill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">social service agencies, subject to organizational exigencies, make "blind men" out of people who have trouble seeing, by teaching them permissible, recognized roles for blind men to follow; to showing how in ghetto schools the self-fulfilling prophecy makes children into failures by treating them as potential failures; and most notably, to showing how prisons, officially operating to rehabilitate prisoners, instead operate to socialize the novice lawbreaker into a subterranean inmate culture that furnishes him or her with a new self as a full-fledged criminal. This perspective lends itself to a cynical appreciation of institutional ironies and considerable skepticism about well- intentioned efforts to rescue deviants and unfortunates back into the dominant society that defined them as deviant in the first place. But the labeling theory and its correlatives are only a small part of the revolution in worldviews that Goffman and his colleagues are bringing about in sociology. The marks of this larger perspective can be gleaned from the above. First, this revolution entails a radical empiricism that is not satisfied with statistical accounts or abstract theorizing about either individuals or society, but that looks in detail at exactly what happens in the situations its subjects are living through. Second, it demands that all acts and social statuses be viewed as the products of social interaction among persons; thus deviance is not to be explained merely in terms of the "deviant," but in terms of the workings of the groups that label him or her as such. Finally, it is based on a radically new view of social reality: not as something "out there" that is always fixed and need only be described and taken account of, but as something that individuals construct as they go along out of an infinite set of possibilities that may be realized in contradictory ways at different times and places. This plural, enacted view of social reality is the essence of the revolutionary breakthrough, and Goffman's conception of life as theater provides us with a key for building our understanding of it into a new sociology. GOFFMAN'S THEATRICAL MODEL OF SOCIAL LIFE Shared staging problems; concern for the way things appear; warranted and unwarranted feelings of shame; ambivalence about oneself and one's audience: these are some of the dramaturgical elements of the human situation.2 Since we all participate on teams we must all carry within ourselves something of the sweet guilt of conspirators. And since each team is engaged in maintaining the stability of some definitions of the situation, concealing or playing down certain facts in order to do this, we can expect the performer to live out his conspiratorial career in some furtiveness.3 2Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1959), p. 237. 3 Ibid., p. 105.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When do people become uneasy? The answer provides Goffman with a key that opens up the everyday social encounters comprising virtually the whole of experienced society. Embarrassment, Goffman notes, occurs when one's claims to present a certain self are contradicted by the situation: when a purportedly well-to-do person asks an acquaintance for a loan, when a date is refused, when status unequals avoid each other's eyes in an elevator. Uneasiness also occurs when persons show themselves to be less than fully and spontaneously involved in a conversation: by self-consciousness, which communicates to others that one is more concerned with how one is presenting oneself than with the conversation itself; by "interaction-consciousness" brought about by an overmanipulative hostess or by uneasy pauses in the conversation; by "other-consciousness" caused by persons whose obvious affectation or insincerity draws attention to themselves and away from the flow of talk; and by preoccupation with things outside of the conversation. Conversation creates a little capsule of reality of its own, and those who violate its standards are the villains of ordinary social life. Correspondingly, there are heroes of sociability, as the famous tale of Sir Francis Drake's refusal to be distracted from his backgammon game by the approaching Spanish Armada well illustrates. In general, then, social interaction is a kind of performance with its own guiding rules. Persons are expected to maintain a consistent social face and to help others in maintaining theirs. Living up to the latter rule is called tact. The rules of politeness serve these functions. Thus, conversationalists avoid threatening topics and contestable claims about themselves or overlook such gambits on the part of others and thus avoid insulting them; there is an effort to stay out of uncontrollable disagreement, to avoid lulls and unresponsiveness, which would suggest a lack of interest in the other's conversation, and to end the conversation in a way that seems natural and does not communicate that one has gotten tired of the other's talk. Goffman works up such observations into a full-fledged theatrical model of social behavior. Behavior has an expressive element as well as a practical element; it is designed to communicate a definition of reality as much as to carry out tasks. Social performances are often put on by teams, such as the husband-and-wife combination entertaining guests in their home, the car salesman convincing a customer, the factory workers putting on a show of diligent effort for the superintendent's inspection. Accordingly, it is possible to view the social world as divided up into frontstage and backstage regions; in the former, a group project is the optimal definition of the group's situation; in the latter, the performers can let down their standards and relax under the cover of a carefully guarded privacy. As Goffman notes, social bonds are strongest between individuals who share common backstages, since they must trust each other to guard the secrets of their common strategy of presenting themselves to outsiders. Why is life like a theater? Goffman suggests two main reasons. First, being able to control the reality that other people see is a prime weapon, available to almost everyone in some degree, for raising one's status,</p>
<p class="calibre1">power, or freedom. Thus, aristocrats and upper-class people use their wealth and leisure to put on shows of grandeur and dignity that give them deference; middle-class people put on a show of respectability to set them above the working classes; managers try to enhance their authority by putting on an impressive demeanor before their subordinates; and workers protect their autonomy from the bosses by restricting their encounters to carefully guarded frontstages. There is a second reason life must be like a theater: Performances are necessary if there is to be a clear, consistent, and recognizable social reality. Situations do not simply define themselves: They must be constructed by symbolic communication; and hence social life must be expressive, whatever else it may be. Goffman thus advances the viewpoint of Durkheim as well as Mead. Durkheim's concept of the collective conscience was a way of pointing out the existence of a shared consciousness as the essence of society. Goffman brings this notion down from the heights of abstraction, so that we no longer find ourselves trying to imagine a big balloon of consciousness hanging over France or England or the United States and making up the collective conscience of those societies; rather, we think in terms of millions of little social realities that come into existence whenever people are together. Situations have a power of their own, transcending the individuals who make them up, just as Durkheim noted that the individual contributes to the collective conscience but is often powerless against its overwhelming force. The power of symbolic realities is found everywhere, from the deafening silence of a church communion or a public ceremony, which keeps individual observers from opening their mouths and gives novice speakers stage fright, to the tacit rules dividing the acceptable from the impermissible in polite conversation. By analyzing situations as processes of social theater, Goffman shows how collective consciences are created and have their powerful effects. Our worlds, Goffman is saying, are full of abstract notions about what is real, both for ordinary members of society and even more so for sociologists. What we know firsthand is always something in the present time, in some particular place and situation; what we believe to be real is something inferred from this situation. We meet someone and infer from what he does and says his character (trustworthy or insincere, amusing or dull) and his status (an important personage or an ordinary guy). Thus, we are always presenting a self to other people, and we control our acts for their effects in expressing what we would like others to think we are like when we are not with them: We take care not to get to a party too early lest it seem that our lives are otherwise empty; we entertain guests in the cleaned-up frontstage of a living room and guard the bedroom backstage. We not only construct characters and statuses for others to see as the permanent realities floating above any immediate here-and-now; we also construct the large organizations that we think of as the permanent, supraindividual structures of society. As we may recognize with some</p>
<p class="calibre1">shock, organizations are invisible. No one has ever seen an organization. What we do see are buildings, which belong to an organization, and organizational charts, which are symbolic representations in geometric form of the formal rules relating to the members of the organization. As we can see from a little mental experimentation, an organization could still exist if its buildings were taken away; it could also exist without any of its present members, since it is made up of invisible positions that can be filled by new people when the old ones leave. Our world, then, is populated by entities (General Motors, the Pentagon, the University of California, the city of San Francisco) that exist only in people's minds; we are misled into thinking of them as physical things because the people who enact these symbolic entities are usually found in specific physical places. As long as some people believe in them, organizations are real in their effects, and people who do not accept their rules are punished as criminals, madmen, or revolutionaries. But to keep these organizations in existence, they must continually be enacted; when someone succeeds in changing the script of the play, the form of the organization changes, and we say that a power play has occurred. Society, in a very important sense, is a theater, and its performances— symbolic social ceremonies—are crucial in maintaining it. Durkheim, sixty years earlier, had argued as a general theory that society is held together by ceremony and ritual; Goffman shows society-sustaining rituals at every point in daily encounters. As Goffman puts it: In so far as the expressive bias of performances comes to be accepted as reality, then that which is accepted at the moment as reality will have some of the characteristics of a celebration. To stay in one's room away from the place where the party is given, or away from where the practitioner attends his client, is to stay away from where reality is being performed. The world, in truth, is a wedding.4 This is a radical way of looking at reality. Social reality is what people say it is, and Goffman is suggesting that instead of trying to focus on some independent things that people seem to be talking about, we should watch them as they are talking about it. The ultimate reality is a puzzle, sometimes a myth, and the "realest" thing we can catch hold of is the behavior of the people constructing reality. A movement of radical empiricists calling themselves ethnomethodologists5 has taken up just this problem: how people go about constructing in their own minds and conversations a view of the social world around them. This movement, led by UCLA sociologist Harold Garfinkel, builds on the insights of the German social philosopher Alfred Schutz (who in turn was influenced by Max Weber's concept of ver- stehen) and on modern logical and linguistic philosophy. It also carries out the more radical implications of Goffman's style of sociology. 4Ibid., pp. 35-36. 5"Ethnomethodology" means the ethnography (anthropologically detached description) of people's methodologies for dealing with everyday reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE ETHNOMETHODOLOGISTS The ethnomethodologists go beyond Goffman in their minute analysis of how people construct an everyday reality. Their main finding has been that people act as if reality were solid, given, and unambiguous, but the social world they communicate about is actually fluid, highly subject to interpretation, and not easily discoverable. In Garfinkel's terms, social communication contains a large quotient of "indexical expressions"—terms that cannot be defined but can only be tacitly understood in the concrete situation by the particular people involved. Words like "this," "now," or "you" are simple examples of indexical expressions; whole systems of ideas can be more complex cases when they contain (as they usually do) concepts and connections that people understand well enough as long as they are in the swing of reading or talking about them, but about which, when pressed for a precise account, they must eventually say, "You know what I mean!" Garfinkel uses the method of revelation through disruption to highlight these facets of people's "practical reasoning." His long-suffering students perform exercises in which they get into a conversation and then ask for full clarification of meanings: subject: Hi, Ray. How is your girlfriend feeling? experimenter: What do you mean, "How is she feeling?" Do you mean physical or mental? (S) I mean how is she feeling? What's the matter with you? [He looked peeved.] (E) Nothing. Just explain a little clearer what you mean. (S) Skip it. How are your Med school applications coming? (E) What do you mean, "How are they?" (S) You know what I mean. (E) I really don't. (S) What's the matter with you? Are you sick?6 The point is not simply to show that people communicate mostly tacitly, taking for granted that their conversational partners know what they are talking about. These experiments also show that people eventually become angry when pressed to explain their statements and that the source of their exasperation comes from a growing recognition that this line of questioning is, in principle, endless. There are indexical expressions contained in virtually everything one says, and the effort to make such expressions objective, to reduce a statement to one in which "You know what I mean" is not ultimately necessary, is impossible. People act as if the world has this objective character, and they expect others to act in the same way, even though this is not a true description of reality. Garfinkel's findings are that people can carry on social relationships 6Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1967), pp. 42-43. © 1967. Prentice-Hall. Inc.</p>
<p class="calibre1">while carrying around a patchwork-like, invisible, and ambiguous social order in their heads precisely because they act as if there were something solid there all the time. People do not usually ask each other to clarify their statements, even when they are patently ambiguous; they give each other the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is a solid meaning that will be forthcoming in due time. The social world, then, is really quite a flimsy thing, but since people do not generally realize this, it can take on a considerable amount of solidity. People confronting a representative of an organization do not usually ask for the precise basis of his or her authority or whether there are rules that require what is being demanded of them. Instead, they assume that what is ordinarily done is proper and necessary, and they accept roles as docile customer, client, or employee that are not necessarily enforceable upon them. Garfinkel illustrated this by having his students go into a department store and offer a small fraction of the marked price for some items. The students found themselves approaching the task with considerable apprehension, because there is an implicit understanding in most American stores that things must be bought for their marked price. But they discovered that once they actually began to bargain—to offer, for example, twenty-five cents for a ninety-eight-cent item—it was like breaking through an invisible barrier. With sufficient assurance they gained command of the situation, and the salespeople became flustered and ill at ease. Often they felt that there was at least some chance of having their offers accepted. Obviously, the rule that the price you see is the price you pay has force only because everyone expects it to be followed; most of its force comes from the fact that it is never challenged. The ethnomethodological viewpoint is potentially revolutionary in its implications. Social structures exist only because people believe that they exist, and those beliefs can be successfully challenged by people with sufficient power or self-assurance to override attempted sanctions. The whole fabric of daily interpersonal ceremony, deference, politeness, and authority exists because it is taken for granted, but it is usually backed up by nothing more than potential social disapproval for its violators by those who believe in its solidity. Persons who see social structure as social myth can puncture the bubble; their equanimity in refusing to accept a conventional definition of the situation gives them the psychological advantage, for the power of the upholders of these conventions rests on their self-assurance that their reality is objective rather than a matter of definition. The hippies led a cultural revolution against constraining formal definitions of situations precisely by their capacity to "blow people's minds" with a well-enacted expression of a counterdefinition of everyday realities. Of course, not all enacted invisible social structures are so easily challengeable. A business organization is a network of rules and roles that exists only because people agree that it exists, but short of a general siege of amnesia, the people who run it are not likely suddenly to deny its existence. After all, there are material and psychological advantages to playing this</p>
<p class="calibre1">symbolic game—those who do, make a living, gain some status and authority, and so on. The state, a police force, an army—all these exist only because their members (or at least a sufficient number of them) agree to act as if their rules and positions were real things; but if they can act as such, they can coerce others into believing, too. But even with the advantages of power, comfort, and wealth that human organizational play-acting brings, such organizations are not as stable as they appear on the surface. The formal organizational chart rarely corresponds to the actual arrangements of power and cooperation; generals are often at the mercy of master sergeants, bosses may exercise less influence than their secretaries, and little-known politicians and bureaucrats can dictate to presidents. Reality is negotiable, even in organizations in which a total denial of the ultimate validity of the organization would be impossible, and how people negotiate it determines what will actually happen within it. Moreover, even an organization that can back up its claims to reality with coercive violence is sometimes subject to a crippling wave of disbelief. Revolutions occur when everyone comes to doubt the power of the state, much in the same way that a bank is destroyed when there is a run on its funds.7 From the merest encounter of strangers avoiding each other's eyes on the street, to the mightiest empire, human social order is ultimately a symbolic reality that exists only as long as it is generally believed in, and it changes as people struggle to shift those beliefs to their own advantage. GOFFMAN'S CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONAL NECESSITY Goffman's position is more conservative than this. He is neither a revolutionary nor a hippie. Rather, he stands squarely in the Durkheimian functionalist tradition, a more empirically oriented Talcott Parsons. Life is full of nonpractical ceremonies, but Goffman sees ceremonies as functionally necessary to maintain social order. He explores the underside of life, but he is not really sympathetic to the underdog. Asylums does not condemn hospital personnel for destroying the selves of mental patients, but explains their behavior in terms of the exigencies of a necessarily bureaucratic total institution. In the same vein Goffman's analysis of the rules of politeness and social ceremony is carried out without irony. In his view individuals who do not live up to the rules of polite interaction are justly punished by embarrassment, self-consciousness, or ostracism, for such rules are functionally necessary for social reality to be kept alive. Indeed, Goffman defines mental illness as the incapacity or unwillingness to perform well and to obey the rules of social encounters. Social justice is harsh; if one does not live up to 7Some organizations, of course, are much flimsier than this. Most voluntary associations, such as new political parties, social clubs, Softball leagues, and stamp collectors associations, go through a period of initial enthusiasm about the organization's objective reality. Then most of them find themselves sliding back down into nonexistence through an acceleration of doubt about the organization's survival, as its believers desert the invisible sinking ship of its reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">such rules, one is punished by one's fellows; and since one's self is derived from others, one may well be stuck with a permanently spoiled identity as a faulty social interactant or a mental patient. But all this is necessary to uphold society, to preserve symbolic reality for those who can participate in it. Like most functionalists, Goffman is too ready to see things as necessary simply because they exist. His descriptions of traditional middle-class politeness are becoming outdated. Although he argues that such formalities are necessary to protect the boundaries of the self and to maintain a clear definition of reality, the increasing informality and frankness of interpersonal manners in the most modern sectors of American life illustrates how flexible people can be. They are tougher than Goffman supposes, capable of more honesty, and willing, at times, to put up with an ambiguous, and freer, reality. In the end Goffman is not willing to follow through on his own radical realism to the point where he could see how individuals struggle to impose their own definitions of reality on others, and the potentially liberating effect when people begin to realize just how this operates. To be sure, the ethnomethodologists also, for the most part, fail to carry through the social implications of their thought. They confine themselves to analyzing in great detail the rules that seem to govern people's everyday behavior—in effect, turning the speculative philosophical field of epistemology into an empirical research enterprise. THE IMPERIALISM OF PHILOSOPHY A great driving force in the development of all this recent microsociology has, in fact, come from philosophy. There has been a philosophical revolution since the beginning of the twentieth century, and its waves have spread slowly to neighboring disciplines. The initial influence for change comes from even further afield—from a controversy that exercised mathematicians at the turn of the century. This was the conflict between the "formalists," who believed they could construct a complete system of basic axioms and definitions, from which they could rigorously deduce any possible mathematics; and the "intuitionists," who argued that mathematics could not be made into a closed system but that its advancement depended upon working out proofs for each new problem as it came along. In the early years of the twentieth century, the formalists made their most ambitious move. The British philosophers Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead tried to show that an axiomatic system of pure logic could be constructed to encompass the basic number system, and thus it would encompass the foundations of all mathematics. And Russell's student Ludwig Wittgenstein soon attempted to create a similar system for human language, thus formalizing the basis of the other side of culture. But these formalist efforts failed. Russell and Whitehead found they had generated paradoxes within their system—contradictions in the basic logic itself. In 1931 the German mathematician Kurt Godel proved that no set of</p>
<p class="calibre1">axioms is ever complete, for it is always necessary to have at least one principle that stands outside the system; and if that principle is to be incorporated into a new, more comprehensive system, yet another principle must stand outside of that, and so on. At about the same time, Wittgenstein was abandoning his earlier effort at a closed philosophical system of language and coming to the conclusion that language is not just a finite universe of meanings that can be combined in different ways but a set of games that one might play—actions that one might do with words rather than merely a list of things at which one might point. Thus talking about things is only one language-game among many; asking, demanding attention, joking, impressing someone—all these actions are other language-games, just as real as the game of applying names to things that philosophers had taken as the only true discourse. This victory of the intuitionists has been spilling over into sociology ever since about 1950. Garfinkel and the ethnomethodologists, with their concern for indexicalities and for infinite regresses of meanings, are translating Wittgenstein's and Godel's discoveries into the language of sociology. Thus we come to see how social meanings are not so much given like concrete things we can point to, but are just contents of our social actions. And they are empirically visible in the language-games that make up most of our social realities. In his recent work, Goffman, too, has captured the spirit of this philosophical revolution. With typical elegance, he sets out the main idea by expounding on the concept of "frames" and their contents. A situation is like what we see inside a picture frame while we observe it from the frame that surrounds it. Yet we can always step outside that frame and make it the content we are now observing, thereby putting a new frame around the content. Reality, then, is like boxes within boxes, if we do not make certain social moves to focus it within a controllable frame. Goffman shows that human actors are always concerned with keeping their frameworks in order; even when we are stepping in and out of frames, there is no escaping the dramaturgical impact of our framing behavior. In Goffman sociology and philosophy become merged, and on this spot the search for the stage machinery by which social reality is constructed comes into ever-sharper focus. THE INFLUENCE OF MICROSOCIOLOGY The potential effect of Goffman and the ethnomethodologists on the field of sociology is enormous. For the first time there opens up a real possibility of sociology's becoming a science—a precise and rigorous body of knowledge that explains why people act as they do in relation to each other and why the symbolic products that we call organizations, institutions, cultures, and societies take their particular patterns. This was not a real possibility as long as sociologists remained at arm's length from the observable reality they were trying to explain, dealing with it either through vague abstrac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions or through the static and secondhand accounts of what people do gleaned from survey questions about their attitudes. Human social behavior has finally become the central focus of attention, not in unrealistic laboratory situations but in the real-life encounters that make up the substance of society. Furthermore, Goffman's model of social performances provides us with a tool for fruitfully organizing this material, simultaneously pointing to the series of events that mold and express an individual personality, the actual dynamics of cooperation and authority that make up an organization, and the negotiation of bonds of sociability and intimacy that knit together social classes and endow them with a status and a group culture. The combination in Goffman of Durkheim and Mead foreshadows a new and powerful social psychology, in which Freud's paradoxes of the conscious and unconscious begin to yield to explanation. Goffman and the eth- nomethodologists offer an approach to the empirical realities of organizations and classes that, applied through the heritage of Weber, can pinpoint the dynamics of the larger structures that link together face-to-face groups into a world society. From this vantage point in time we are beginning to see a new vision of humankind, which was only dimly and partially perceived by the thinkers of the past. In the work of Freud, Darwin, and Spencer, of Durkheim, Weber, Mead, Goffman, and many others, we are reminded of human beings in the long perspective of biological evolution: distinctively gregarious and aggressive animals, linked to their fellows by elaborate emotional interactions, capable of symbolic communications that evoke unseen and unseeable realities, putting on collective symbol plays before the audience of their fellows and recapitulating them inside their own heads as symbolic thought, and thus filling our bare physical planet with that invisible world we call society. We struggle like animals for domination in a group that we need too much to wish to destroy; our weapons are not only teeth and nails and their mechanical extensions in human-made tools of violence, but rituals and communications that play on others' emotions and guide them by the images before their eyes and in their minds. Through these efforts groups are created and other people are excluded from them; organizations are formed and their control disputed; vast industries are produced; art and science and the rest of our symbolic culture arise, forming an invisible network that dominates even the dominators and comprises the spiraling complexity of human consciousness in the face of the inert chemical universe. Our own realization of these processes is gradually taking shape into a sociology. And if the sociologies of the far past—of the times of Marx, Spencer, and Sumner—have helped to create the popular worldviews of our day, we may expect the popular awareness of the future to take on a new sophistication and a new tone from the sociological advances of today: a new sophistication and a new tone from the sociological advances of today: a new sophistication about the dilemmas and intricacies of a world in which human beings are free to conflict with each other, even as the chains of interdependence lock them in; and a new tone resulting from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new image of humankind. Thinkers of the past have seen human beings as creatures of their heredity or of their history of rewards and punishments, a thing of blind trial and error, or a cog in a larger structure or environment. All these models contain elements of truth, but the best sociology gives yet another image of the fundamental nature of human beings: creatures who create their own actions and their meanings and construct new realities where none existed before. Constrained as we are in what we can easily or are likely to create, nevertheless the social world is our own product. The solid world dissolves, opening up a universe of possibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Contemporary Sociological Theory in France, Germany and the United States It is notoriously difficult to have detachment about one's own times. But we are already close to the end of the twentieth century. One era is passing away, another is in the making. No doubt some of the intellectual events that are happening right now are a significant part of our story of the discovery of society. But we will not really know what is significant until later, when such events can be considered retrospectively from the vantage point of many decades in the future. Only the twenty-first century will be able to judge the intellectual accomplishments of the late twentieth century. It is in a tentative spirit, then, that we try here to bring the "discovery of society" up to date with some of the intellectual developments of our own times. We will provide a brief introduction to some of the representative theories of the sociological world: those of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu in France; Jurgen Habermas in Germany; and Randall Collins and Immanuel Wallerstein in the United States. One might argue with our selections; other theories could just as well be provided. Our only rationale is that we think these lines of thought are interesting. And for obvious reasons (considering that one of the theories we will deal with is that of one of the present authors), our selections have been those that were especially easy for us to produce. MICHEL FOUCAULT: HISTORY AS DISCOURSE Michel Foucault (1926-1984) has been in recent decades the most talked about of French intellectuals. Strictly speaking, he was a historian not a sociologist. But he was crossing disciplinary boundaries from the very beginning, observing psychiatric practice in mental hospitals during the 1950s/ and teaching classes in psychopathology at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. Combining these materials led him/ naturally enough, to begin 251</p>
<p class="calibre1">publishing on the history of madness and then broadening out into related topics. Thus we have a series ranging from Madness and Civilization (1961) to The Birth of the Clinic (1963) to Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (1975) to The History of Sexuality (1976). This is interesting enough material, all right, but how does it qualify Foucault as the leading intellectual in France, and a thinker that sociologists must take into account? The answer is that Foucault was a man with a program. His most important book, The Archeology of Knowledge (1969), laid out an argument for a new way of conceiving history, and indeed any intellectual discipline. We can grasp how powerful his claim is when we realize that he means we must reconceptualize every intellectual discipline/ not just the social sciences but the natural sciences as well, and not just the theoretical and scholarly ones but the applied, practical fields. What can all these have in common? They are all forms of discourse. Instead of reflecting or investigating the world, these disciplines construct the very nature of our world and determine the way we behave. They are ways of talking, and of not talking; as such they are intrinsically social, and they are sources of power in the deepest sense. Concern with discourse did not originate with Foucault. It has been a theme of linguistics and literary studies, and more recently, of the philosophy of language; and the application of linguistic concepts (most notably by the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss) to society and its products is the key to the movement known as French structuralism. But Foucault is not merely a structuralist, although he acknowledges some kinship to that movement. One might say Foucault took a fresh approach to the whole topic of discourse. Levi-Strauss and the other structuralists examined societies and their products as systems, structured by signs in relationship to each other. Levi- Strauss and others, for a while, seemed to be searching for the underlying code that governed the symbolic system of a society. Following some fundamental principles of linguistics, the structuralists expected these systems to be constructed out of binary oppositions: distinctions between pairs of categories. Later, the structuralist program came under attack, and "poststructuralists" and "deconstructionists" argued that the codes were not merely binary, or that no such code could be found, or that signs themselves are historical products which are endlessly subject to rein- terpretation. Structuralism, which began as a search for some eternal, universal underlying properties of the human mind, eventually turned into a radical relativism in which nothing at all could validly be said. (The last is the position of the most famous of the "deconstructionists," Jacques Derrida.) Foucault maintained his distance from these debates. Since he began as a historian rather than an anthropologist, literary critic, or philosopher, he was never tempted to imagine a closed system of signs; and he felt no need to break out from that system, either. His subject was always real human beings in the midst of the material conditions of their lives. His vivid description of the lepers in the Middle Ages, or the prison cells and factory buildings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, exemplifies the kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of baseline from which Foucault worked, and which kept him immune from the idealist tendencies of the structuralist and poststructuralist intellectuals. Foucault always had his eye on power, control, struggle, and historical change. At the same time, he was concerned with the history of ideas. But this did not mean merely the history of intellectuals; it meant the history of ideas in practice, like the practice of the doctors, the prison reformers, the psychiatrists, and the factory managers whom Foucault studied. Foucault was thus able to offer a theory of how ideas interact with the social world, ordinary life at its most ordinary, even at its grubbiest level. There is a lot of shock value in Foucault's writings, but this is only the superficial part of what brought him attention. His fame comes from a deeper source—from his attempt at a theory of the connection between discourse, power, and history. Discourse as a System of Constraints What is discourse? At first glance, it is talking, communicating: It seems to use signs to designate things. This was the starting point of structuralist linguistics, the relationship between signifiers and that which they signify, together with the relations among the signs themselves. But Foucault argues that discourses are not merely groups of signs, but are practices which constitute the objects of which they are speaking. Discourse is more than signs pointing to things or oppositions among signs. Foucault sets as his task to analyze what is this "more than." One way to look at this is to recognize a system of discourse as a system of exclusion or constraint. It is a set of boundaries as to what can be said and what cannot be said; and accordingly, if something cannot be said, it cannot even be thought about. Foucault suggests there are three great forms of exclusion: the division between madness and reason; prohibited words; and the will to truth. Let us look briefly at each of these. Madness and Reason. Discourse is always supposed to be meaningful. No one listens to nonsense. But where is the dividing line drawn, and how? This is historically variable. Here we see a reason Foucault conceives his studies of madness and of psychiatry as uncovering a crucial form within civilization. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the modern profession of psychiatry appeared. Foucault regards this as no minor development, but as a fundamentally new way of structuring the relationship between reason and unreason. It is a crucial fault line between historical epochs. He attempts to show this by examining the way in which the materials of the new psychiatry— the people who are its patients, the problems which are their diseases—were handled before and after the rise of the new discipline. The shift is not merely an intellectual one, as if the doctors' theories about mental disorders had changed from theories about fevers and affections of the brain to a new conception of "nervous diseases," and later, with Freud and his generation, to a purely psychological conception of causes and cures. For Foucault shows that the whole complex of practices</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding the dividing line of madness and reason shifted its grounds during this time. In the Middle Ages, madness was just another category of the untouchables, the outcasts of society. Just as lepers were segregated into their encampments of horror, the mad might be gathered together on a ship and put adrift in the sea. All this was connected with religious conceptions, with a notion of God's unfortunates, people who were accursed, but by the same token, had something of the holy about them. It was not a matter for the province of medicine, but a matter of the public organization of society. All the different classes of unfortunates were mixed together, and houses of confinement mingled the insane with the poor, the unemployed, with debtors, vagabonds, and prisoners. When we reach the watershed of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the social connections are remolded in an entirely different direction. Modern psychiatry takes shape as a set of practices, designed no longer to exclude madness from society, but to contain and control it. Reformers like Tuke in England and Pinel in France cut the tethered madmen from their chains, and put them in specialized institutions under programs which were to inculcate them with reasonableness and self-restraint. It was a movement of humanitarianism and enlightenment; but at the same time, it placed a new stress on the inner control and reform of the individual. Furthermore, the methods that were put into action were part of a complex which is found in many spheres. The mental hospital, the insane asylum, is an institution for surveillance, for control, for changing people's behavior; madness is to be dominated by reason. Parallel developments happen in other spheres. The poor and diseased had similarly been outcasts of medieval society; sometimes they were the objects of charity, and the focus of a religious message. They were a fact of life, part of the universe of sin, suffering, and atonement. But with the dawning of "modernity," the beggars too are brought under a program of social control, to be organized into workhouses and put to obligatory labor. Apparently further afield, but conceptually just around the corner, criminality undergoes a similar transformation. Where once criminals had been publicly tortured, mutilated, and executed, they too are put into the new institutions of discipline; ritual exclusion is replaced by specialized organizational control. And this shift is not merely at the margins of society; it affects even the central sphere of work, as laborers lose their independence and become herded into factories. Prisons, schools, army barracks, hospitals, factories, and reformatories all come to resemble each other. This shift, taken as a whole, is a good example of what Foucault means by a "discoursive formation" or system of discourse. We find, at the modern end, a way of conceiving the world; in particular, we have a dividing line between reason and unreason, crystallized upon the technical discourse of the psychiatric profession. The way we think today, and hence the way we see the world, is based on this conception of reason and its boundaries. But the ideas of psychiatry did not simply come from observation of the world, nor are they a straightforward development from the earlier, less ac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">curate theories of premodern medicine. They are part of a much wider shift in the organization of society, from one system of discourse to another. In the modern world, what is normal or abnormal is now judged by professionals with their specialized systems of control. This is the social transformation that constitutes the modern system of discourse. Prohibited Words. Another way in which a system of discourse shapes our world is by allowing what can be said, and excluding other things. There are many ways in which Foucault could illustrate this point. He chose sexuality, no doubt because it is such a striking example, in any society, of the difference between what is proper and improper. Foucault again draws on before-and-after portraits of the transformation of modern Europe. In the seventeenth century, there was considerable frankness in regard to sexual behavior; by modern standards, the codes regulating the coarse, the indecent, and the obscene were lax. Sexuality, one might say, was part of the public sphere, and its pleasures and power relations, physical attractions and repulsions were out in the open, subject to a conventional discourse. By the nineteenth century, there is an entirely different way of treating sex. Silence becomes the rule regarding most aspects of sex; conceptions of morality and virtue are elevated, and not only enjoin sexual monogamy but make any public attention to eroticism itself a scandalous violation. Sexual behavior of course does not go away. The height of prudery in the Victorian era was also a time of massive prostitution, when proper bourgeois gentlemen frequently had mistresses, and society had a whole backstage of sexuality. Foucault stresses again that the issue is not behavior, but discourse. It is not just a matter of what people did, or what they thought about what they did; it is, rather, a field of conceptions and possible enunciations, of things that can be said and things that cannot be said. In other words, there is a new dividing line between the respectable and the unrespectable, enforced by the new system of sexual discourse. Sexual behavior can still go on, but it is shaped into its own sphere, where it must take account of this dividing line. It must hide itself away into privacy or even secretiveness. Hence the whole experience of sex takes on a new quality. Foucault argues that Freud in the twentieth century, and the subsequent movement to open up sexuality as a new personal style of liberation, does not fundamentally transform the system of discourse and exclusion laid down in the previous century. Foucault charges that Freudian psychiatry only reinforces the mainstream conception of what is normal, and helps patients adjust to it. Whether Foucault is right about this may be open to question. That is, there may be a still newer, twentieth-century system of discourse which changes once again the field of possibilities in regard to sex. But it is probably too early to judge this very surely. And whatever the historical specifics turn out to be, any new system of discourse will no doubt turn out to have its own areas of exclusion, possibilities that it does not allow people to consciously consider.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Will to Truth. One of Foucault's most radical arguments is that the very conception of truth is itself one of the exclusionary systems of discourse. That discourse should be oriented toward truth is a characteristically modern idea. We live in this form of discourse, and hence we take it for granted. Again, Foucault shows the historical dividing line that brought us to where we are today. For example, the European penal laws of the seventeenth century and earlier were based on a notion of right; there were certain self-evident principles to be defended—obedience to God, the authority of the king, the dignities reserved for the nobility, and so on—and punishments were carried out to uphold these principles. The shift to modern penology is not merely a shift toward greater humanitarianism, a wave of sympathy which abolished the tortures and carnivallike public executions of the previous period. More fundamentally, Foucault argues, modern penology is a shift in how laws are justified. Henceforth, laws of all sorts are justified because they are based on "true discourse"; they are the products of rational discussion, leading to truthful conclusions. One might say that modern penal laws are supposed to be "scientific," but Foucault's point goes deeper than this: Modern science itself arises because of the ascendancy of this new form of discourse, discourse dominated by the "will to truth." Foucault's use of this term "will to truth" echoes Nietzsche. As we have already seen in Chapter 4, Nietzsche proposed to turn modern scientific and critical consciousness back upon itself. Writing at the time when anthropologists were starting to explain the social institutions in remote tribes as the products of particular social causes, Nietzsche declared he would look at modern civilization in the same way. Our own institutions and moralities are no more eternal verities than those of any ancient or tribal society of the past; they are all the results of historical processes, and each is destined—so Nietzsche argued—to change into something else. One of the main traits of our modern civilization is the emphasis it places upon science, upon rationality, upon a faith in the power of the human mind to discover truth. But this attitude is more faith than actuality; it simply indicates a form of the human will to power in our times. It is a will to truth, that hides from itself by seeing only the truths that we have allegedly encountered. Foucault is, at least partially, an heir to this Nietzschean way of looking at the modern world. Like Nietzsche, Foucault tries to uncover the ways in which we have socially constructed this emphasis on truth, and with it have excluded all the other ways that discourse can operate. What are these alternatives? One of them, Foucault points out, can be seen by looking at ancient Greek society, in the period just before the first philosophers (in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.) created the modern ideal of the love of truth. (The word "philosophy" itself means "love of knowledge.") The earliest Greek society, as depicted in Homer, was enveloped in rituals: sacrifices to the gods, readings of omens to predict the future, attempts to ward off catastrophes. This was a form of discourse, Foucault argues, but it was a discourse</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned only with what it did, not what it said. Rituals were an attempt to react to the world, and to mold it. Rituals did not express a philosophy which saw the world as ruled by gods and invisible forces; its main thrust was not to describe the world at all, but to act on it. With Thales, Heraclitus, Socrates, and the other philosophers, the whole form of discourse changed. Discourse was now oriented toward truth, toward contemplation and description; discourse for the first time was judged by what it said, by what it pointed to beyond itself. Foucault thus stresses that we should understand the basis of our own discourse, our own concern with truth. Truth is not an absolute but a historical product, the focus of a form of discourse that emerges only at particular times and places. The more basic form of discourse is practice, not consciousness. That we have elevated consciousness to the ideal form of discourse is just the particular, contemplative, and intellectual form of discursive practice in our own times. Discourse and Power Discourse is also a system of power. It implies who is authorized to speak, and who may not. Some persons must remain silent, at least in certain situations, or else their utterances are regarded as unworthy of attention. We see this in the example of the medicalization of madness. In medieval society the conception of madness was part of religious discourse and the practice of public segregation; the entire community was involved in recognizing and acting out the borderline between madness and normalcy. The watershed of the nineteenth century has given madness over into the hands of experts, whose opinions alone count on this subject. In a similar way, there is power underlying the system of discourse which constitutes sexuality. The sexual behavior which can be talked about openly has a different social status than sexual behavior which must remain behind the screen. The system of discourse produces repression at the level of feelings and thoughts; though a hidden and seemingly agentless system of control, it is a real power in society nonetheless. The educational system itself, says Foucault, is primarily a system of power. The system of educational discourse focuses what we can say and think about; it constitutes what objects are real; what is public, what is private, what is under the province of technical specialists. The schools, in Foucault's eyes, are a set of rituals through which individuals pass; the end result is to divide persons into those who are authorized to speak of particular subjects and those who are ruled out from serious speaking by their lack of expertise. Modern society, unlike other societies, is dominated by the written word, by the form of discourse embodied in legal rules, bureaucratic reports, and professional technicalities. All this makes up the basic system of modern power. Power, then, is Foucault's overarching theme. Most of his historical studies concern transformations in the system of power. Medieval society</p>
<p class="calibre1">was rather coarse and brutal, a society in which everything took place under the pitiless eye of the public. Power was more nearly transparent, and everything was directed toward maintaining the boundaries by direct exclusion and repression: Lepers and madmen were herded to the outskirts of town, criminals and heretics were burned in the marketplace. Modernity, for Foucault, is a shift toward a different organization of power. Now there is a sharp split between public and private, and the border between them is controlled by specialists with their own professionalized discourse. The modern prison, the insane asylum, the factory, the bureaucratic welfare system, are all applications of the same structure; all institute discipline behind closed walls. Foucault would argue that the psychoanalyst's office is no more than an extension of this prevailing model. The means by which we attempt to escape from the confinements of modernity, Foucault suggests, are no more than continuations of the basic structure. Foucault's analysis, of course, is not the last word on this subject. There are many ways in which the late twentieth century is different from the earlier "modern" times Foucault wrote about; and there may well be more historical shifts in the system of discourse than Foucault recognizes. There are probably more forms of power than he takes account of, and more ways in which people struggle against power. Foucault has popularized a way of seeing the entire world under the aspect of discourse; it remains to extend his model still further. From the point of view of sociology, we might look at Foucault's fame in yet another way. In the narrower sense, Foucault might be regarded as a specialist in the historical sociology of deviance. But as Durkheim pointed out, deviance does not merely concern the margins of society. Deviance provides us with something like a natural experiment, showing us the conditions that hold society together by comparison with the occasions on which society falls apart. Foucault makes use of the history of deviance in exactly the same way. He is above all concerned with what it tells us about social control; he focuses on the abnormal for the light which it casts on the normal. The picture Foucault gives is that the normal is socially constructed, and historically changeable. This is a powerful continuation of one of the main insights of the sociological tradition. PIERRE BOURDIEU: SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE AND CULTURAL CAPITAL The French intellectual milieu is rather different from the specialization which dominates in the English-speaking world. Leading French academics are also intellectuals in the broadest sense, who make their voices heard on philosophy and politics, literature and art, as well as in social science. We have already seen this in the case of Foucault. Similarly, the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote plays and novels, as well as an existentialist philosophy that included his own version of psychoanalysis; later in his career,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartre produced a quasi-Marxian philosophical system under the title of Critique of Dialectical Reason that can be regarded as a combination of philosophy and sociology. The anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss not only developed a theory of tribal kinship systems, but his works on primitive mythology were expanded into a system of analysis, structuralism, which exerted vast influence on philosophy and literary theory. Within recent French sociology, the most important figure is perhaps Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu has not had the same degree of public fame as Foucault, Sartre, or Levi-Strauss. But for sociology he is more immediately relevant. For one thing, unlike other French intellectuals who touch on the theory of society, Bourdieu is a professional sociologist, actively involved in research. For many years he has directed the Centre de Sociologie Europeenne in Paris, the most important empirical research institute in France. Thus he has had the advantage, over the purely theoretical efforts of other French intellectuals, of being able to dig up new research information. It is worth noting, too, that although Bourdieu has reaped most of the fame for these research efforts, he has been assisted by many talented collaborators, such as Jean-Claude Passeron, Jean-Claude Chamboredon, Luc Boltanski, and others. His group has studied the cultural structure of modern life in the educational system of France, as well as other aspects of culture, high and low: museum going, amateur photography, home decor, the competitive field of the high-fashion designers, and the factional structure of intellectuals. From Bourdieu's research group, we learn more about the differences within a modern society than from any previous sociologist. But Bourdieu is more than a describer of the worlds in which different social classes live. He is a theorist, who develops his own position by borrowing and synthesizing from Durkheim and Marx, as well as from the anthropologists Marcel Mauss and Levi-Strauss. Moreover, Bourdieu adds a comparative dimension from his own experience, early in his career, when he did anthropological field work on the Kabyle tribe in the mountains of Algeria. Both in tribal societies and in industrial capitalist societies, Bourdieu proposes that culture is an arena of stratification and conflict. Culture is itself an "economy," which is simultaneously related to what we more conventionally call "the economy"—that is, the production and distribution of goods and services. Stratification in the cultural economy and in the material economy are reciprocally related, as cause and effect of each other. For Bourdieu, culture is a realm of power struggle, related to the struggle over the means of violence that characterizes the realm of politics. Hence Bourdieu's central concept, symbolic violence. This is defined in Reproduction: In Education, Society, and Culture, which Bourdieu wrote with Jean-Claude Passeron, as "power which manages to impose meanings and to impose them as legitimate by concealing the power relations which are the basis of its force." Such power is very widespread. It makes up the content of formal schooling, but also of child rearing, of the styles people display in public, of religion, and of the communications media. Their legitimacy as cultural meanings by which people define the world and each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other's place in it is based upon force. But this force is hidden, and necessarily so. The school teaches a culture authorized by the dominant class, but the school must claim to be neutral in all class conflicts, for only by appearing to be neutral can it add any power to the dominant side. One of Bourdieu's main contentions is mat culture does have a relative autonomy, adding its own specific force to lhat of sheer physical and economic coer- in arbitrary selection from the universe of arbitrariness; it cannot teach cultural rela- cion. The culture of the school is possibilities, but it must hide this tivism without undermining itseli'. The theme comes out strongly in Bourdieu's most theoretical work, Outline of a Theory of Practice, where he draws heavily upon his Algerian tribal materials. Society, he claims, is held together by deception, or mis- recognition. Here Bourdieu gives his own twist to the Durkheimian tradition. Durkheim had argued that .society is held together by ritually created beliefs in its gods. In Bourdieu's sense, this involves a fundamental mis- recognition, since society creates the gods, but must hide this fact from itself because only by believing in the gods as objective can the belief be effective. Marcel Mauss had extended Durkheim's ritual theory to the exchange of gifts which is the basis of the pririitive economy. Giving, receiving, and reciprocating gifts is strongly hedg id with social obligation, since it is an insult to refuse a gift, and a rejects &gt;n of social ties if one does not repay one gift with a return gift. But the very idea of a gift is that it is felt to be voluntary rather than a mere payment for previous goods; hence one cannot carry out a gift exchange at all in the proper, and obligatory, spirit unless involved in it. took up in his Elementary Structures of ctures of tribal societies from the political one denies there is any obligation This is the line Levi-Strauss Kinship, to derive the various strr. and economic alliances produced by marriages—which Levi-Strauss analyzes as gift exchanges of women between families. Bourdieu criticizes Levi-Strauss for not placing enough emphasis on the ideological aspect of kinship rules; the official beliefs as to what constitutes a high-status marriage is itself imposed by the force of the dominant families, who are struggling for advantageous alliances But Bourdieu also carries this model of misrecognized exchanges still further, by showing that not only marriages, but also tribal feuds and vendettAs are a kind of gift economy. Among the Kabyle, insults and murders must be avenged, in order to keep up a family's honor. At the same time, a istrong family must give insults and start fights, for it is only by having ei Lemies that one can show honor. But one must carefully choose with whorr one will fight. One dishonors oneself, for example, by challenging, or accepting a challenge from, an opponent who is too weak to fight properly. Cany ing out fights with proper enemies, then, brings honor to both sides, and :onstitutes another hidden gift exchange. Bourdieu goes so far as to refer to it as an economy of "throats" cut by the murderer's knife, which are "lent" and "returned." It is an economy of honor, carried out under the giise of physical coercion. Here Bourdieu even manages to show symbolic violence misrecognized as real violence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Bourdieu, this case is not an extreme one. "Every exchange," he says, "contains a more or less dissimulated challenge, and the logic of challenge and riposte is but the limit toward which every act of communication tends."1 This is Mauss's theme again, for every gift holds the prospect of dishonoring its recipient, if he or she cannot repay it with an equally prestigious return gift; it is upon this logic that the competitive gift-giving in the potlatch was played. And a theme of Levi-Strauss as well: For the regularities of tribal marriage patterns breed not only alliances but also hatreds and wars when expected exchanges are not satisfactorily carried out. The borderlines from appeasement to alliance, and again from alliance to rivalry, are thin ones. It is this logic that Bourdieu has generalized. The exchange of culture in this misrecognized form is the basis of the reproduction of the entire society. In modern society, schooling reproduces the distribution of cultural capital among social classes. The content of the dominant schooling is the culture that corresponds to the interests of the dominant classes. This constitutes cultural capital, the chief instrument of transforming power relations into legitimate authority. Each new generation passing through the school system thus reproduces the structure of legitimation: Those who are successful in the system acquire legitimate domination, while those who are unsuccessful acquire a sense of the legitimacy and inevitability of their own subordination. This constitutes a double reproduction, in that both the structural relations among the classes are maintained, and particular families within each social class pass along their advantages, or disadvantages, from generation to generation. The principal means by which this transmission occurs Bourdieu calls the habitus. This means the internalization of an arbitrary cultural standard, at first in the family, later reinforced in the school. The habitus grows over time by feeding upon itself; consumption of a certain kind of culture, such as museum going, gradually develops into a need for more of the same. Hence children from culturally advantaged or disadvantaged homes not only start in the world with varying cultural dispositions and possessions, but increase their distances from one another as time goes along. Schooling, in this view, does not so much create symbolic capital as develop it into more refined forms; as in learning one's native language, one begins practically and customarily, later, consciously and systematically. Once finished with schooling, individuals carr}' a fund of culture which, if it is worth enough on the existing cultural market, gives them entree to particular occupations and social circles. This movement of individuals through a/system of cultural inculcation thus reconstitutes the structure of society. In tribal societies, symbolic capital consists of honor, of kinship ties, and of myths such as those which define the dominant and subordinate places of men and women in the order of things. This culture hides stratification, 'Pierre Bourdieu, Outline of a Theory of Practice (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 14.</p>
<p class="calibre1">by defocusing it, and by creating ^;he authorized categories through which group members must talk and think about the world. Culture reproduces the entire structure of society, including its material economy. Here again we find the logic of misrecognition and symbolic violence. The tribal economy seems to eschew strict economic calculations, and seems instead to work on an ethos of alternating oenuriousness and extravagance. Kabyle families bankrupt themselves to put on a display of lavish spending at a wedding, or go to any lengths to on to traditional family lands. Yet all of these are moves in the economy of honor. Like the vendetta exchange of "cut throats," these extravagances and refusals of utilitarian considerations are means of gaining family honor and hence social power. For the family with much prestige will have a wi|de network of persons who are obligated to it by its extravagances; such a jamily can call upon many helpers when there are collective tasks to be done. Such a family will have many fighters when it engages in warfare, and many workers when there is agricultural work. Thus expenditures on the symbolic market bring their return in power and in renewed material v wealth. The various realms flow into and reproduce one another. This argument, Bourdieu beliibves, is quite general. Symbolic capital is always credit. In the tribal economy, it consists of obligations accumulated, which can be cashed in the form of a work force or fighters at the times when they are needed. Such symbolic capital circulates, like money, in a market. "Wealth, the ultimate basis of power, can exert power, and exert it durably, only in the form of symbolic capital."2 Wealth can reproduce itself only if it is turned into forms that generate social obligation, and hence the alliances and deferences that make up social power. The same is true in a modern capitalist society, where tie forms of cultural domination shift but the principle remains the same. In either case, the cultural market operates as symbolic violence: "the gentle, Invisible form of violence, which is never recognized as such, and is not so much undergone as chosen, the violence of credit, confidence, obligation, personal loyalty, hospitality, gifts, gratitude, piety."3 Such a circulation o: cultural capital, in fact, is the most economical mode of domination. Bourdieu's view of history consists of a typology of the two versions of society he has considered: rural Algeria and modern France. These correspond to two modes of domination. There is a domination which is constantly being made and remade ir personal interactions; and a domination which is mediated by objective and impersonal media. The former consists of the ritual exchanges and vendettas of tribal society; the latter of the impersonal organizations which dii iistribute titles, whether these consist of property deeds or academic degrees. The difference between the two types of society is "the degree of or. jectification of the accumulated social capital."4 In the tribal society, pow er is continually negotiated by individu- 2Ibid.,p.l95. 3rbid./P.192. "Ibid., p. 184.</p>
<p class="calibre1">als on their own behalf. Hence such societies strike the modern observer as both more brutal and also more personal and humane than one's own. In the modern society, domination is based upon objective mechanisms—the competitive structures of the school system, the law courts, and the money economy—and hence its products appear divorced from people and take on "the opacity and permanence of things."5 The transition between the two types occurs when the culture is no longer the immediate possession of everyone who uses it, but becomes stored in writing. Then specialists begin to monopolize culture, and to develop it into esoteric forms of religion, art, and specialized knowledge. This primitive accumulation of cultural capital is Bourdieu's counterpart of the Marxian primitive accumulation; it marks the transition to class societies. A further stage in objectification of the system of domination occurs with the elaboration of the educational system. Whereas the personalized society of ritual exchanges is local and fragmented, the educational system unifies all cultural capitals into a single market. Formal educational degrees are to cultural exchange what money is to the material economy; both create a single standard of value, and guarantee free and universal circulation. Bourdieu goes so far as to say that an educational system producing certified degrees guarantees that one can always convert cultural capital back into money at an objectively fixed rate: that investment in culture always pays off economically at the same level. Once a society organized in this way comes into being, Bourdieu sees only very limited possibilities for its transformation. Class society continuously and objectively reproduces itself. Political and economic upheavals cannot change its structure, precisely because of the relative autonomy of the cultural system. Neither the Marxists nor the Third World nationalists promise any relief, for these are movements formulated by intellectual rebels, who themselves have come to the top by virtue of their superior cultural capital. A Soviet type of society, dominated by the possessors of ideological capital, would constitute no formal change in the structure of domination. Nor can the school system itself be successfully destratified. Every movement in this direction has been a failure. Citing French data in the post-World War II period, Bourdieu shows that social classes have continued the same rank ordering of educational attainment, even though school attendance has expanded massively. Nor can reforms within the style and content of schooling change the situation. For the initiative in such reforms is always taken by highly cultivated intellectuals, themselves the products of the system that they are changing. The shift to the "free school" environment, to "soft" discipline and an emphasis on autonomy and creativity, remains nevertheless a mode of cultural inculcation and social selection, and one that most favors the children of avant-garde families. The newest, freest culture only adds another level of sophistication to an accumulation of cultural capital. There is no escape from the circle: The person who deliberates upon culture is already cultivated. 5Ibid., p. 184.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only formal education, btjt all spheres of culture are both stratified and stratifying. In Bourdieu's huge work, Distinction, he and his fellow researchers demonstrate that these (relationships are found in all spheres of culture, from tastes in painting and music to the kinds of food one eats, the way one entertains friends, the furniture one buys, the sports one watches or participates in, the makeup one wears, the bodily contours one clothes or displays, as well as the politics and public issues one is concerned with or rejects. These are products of one's position within the structure of society, and they serve to reproduce that .structure over time. For instance, the taste for art: Bourdieu shows that the1 upper-middle/upper-class elite divides rather sharply from the lower-middle/working-class nonelite over the kinds of art works it considers beautiful. The lower echelons insist upon a more substantive, content-oriented standard of beauty (a sunset, a picture of a first communion), while the elite rejects these as sentimental and prefers pictures which have a fcrmal aesthetic, even if the content itself might be an everyday or even ugly object (a photograph of gnarled hands). The two aesthetics are hierarchizing, in that the "elite" overviews, transcends, and subsumes the lower; classes' standards. The elite practices a one-upmanship that always stay:; one jump ahead of the "average" standard of appreciation. Not only can objects of ugliness be transformed into works of formal beauty; but when] the lower-middle class becomes more educated into appreciating abstract ;irt, the elite jumps ahead to prefer lower- class sentimental kitsch or "pop art," as an ironic distancing from what used to be the high-status art. | Tastes in art are only one illusl ration of the class struggle which goes on implicitly in every realm of culture. This form of struggle is particularly insidious because it appears to transcend the vulgar level of claims to economic domination and organized power. The upper-class aesthetic self-consciously distances itself from mere money, mere material things—as if there were not a tremendous material investment not only in the art objects themselves, but even in the years (or generations) of training necessary to appreciate art and to establish one's standards around them. Furthermore, the elites indulge in their standards dogmatically and without self-criticism, because these standards seem to deny mere mundane stratification. Social boundaries are maintained automatically because persons feel someone else would not be much fun to associate with, because they don't like the same kind of entertainment, and because conversation with them leads too easily to arguments over matters of taste. The same persons might be "liberal" or even radical in their avowed beliefs, and would never allow themselves to snub someone else on what they thought was a matter of social class. Aesthetics, and especially the aesthetics of everyday life and cultural consumption, are so powerful in reproducing the class structure precisely because they claim to stand outside it. Bourdieu's system is completely closed. It is totally cynical, totally pessimistic. We are eternally doomed, to stratification, and to misrecognition of our bonds. We cannot get outside bur own skins; we can only change places</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside an iron circle. In this respect, Bourdieu is probably too extreme. He places all his emphasis on the reproduction of the system of stratification, not enough on variations that have occurred between different times and places among human societies. A better-rounded picture would show more of the conflict which actually takes place in societies, and the organizational struggles by which groups do manage to reshape the stratification systems, at least to some degree. The strength of Bourdieu's system is his effort to create a truly general economics. His analyses of cultural capitalism and symbolic violence might be called "a Marxism of the superstructure." More precisely, he claims that the distinction between the economic and noneconomic spheres must be abolished. Conventional economics is but "a particular case of a general science of the economy of practices, capable of treating all practices, including those purporting to be disinterested or gratuitous, and hence noneconomic, as economic practices directed towards the maximizing of material or symbolic profit." So far, Bourdieu has provided us only with a sketch of this system. For Bourdieu's economics still lacks precisely what Marx attempted to provide, a dynamism for historical change, and a mechanism for internal struggle and revolution. JURGEN HABERMAS AND THE SEARCH FOR REASON It is the concern for transformation and revolution that strikes us most when we cross the Rhine into another intellectual scene. The most influential sociologist in Germany in recent years is Jurgen Habermas. Habermas is actually a philosopher by training, but he has argued that pure ideas themselves are empty without praxis, application to ameliorating our real social circumstances. As a result, he has pushed further than anyone else in turning all philosophical issues into questions for sociology, and in constructing a comprehensive theory about society and its direction of change. In all these respects, Habermas is the inheritor of the Frankfurt school, the group of neo-Marxists whom we have already mentioned in Chapter 2 (including Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse). Habermas himself was trained by the Frankfurt school after World War II, and in the 1960s he was regarded as its leader in the younger generation. During the radical student movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Habermas called for a "critical sociology" which would examine the sources of alienation in the modern world, not only within the capitalist economy, but within every institution, including governments, bureaucratic agencies, and science itself. He advocated a "long march through institutions" to emancipate human capacities. But Habermas also criticized German student radicals over the issue of using violence to resist and change capitalist society, and eventually broke with the radical movement. 6Ibid., p. 183.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the 1970s and 1980s, Habermas gradually moved away from Marxism, to build up his own general theory of society. This is expressed most comprehensively in his Theory of Communicative Action. Habermas takes on the heroic task of restoring the ideal of reason as the standard and goal by which every form of thought and action is to be guided. Although the entire twentieth century has bfeen eroding such claims from the point of view of relativism, naturalism, subjectivism, or the fragmenting process of analytical sophistication, Habermas steps in to restore the Enlightenment ideal of all-penetrating reason. More than that: Habermas wants to defend the belief in progress, in a world-historical evolution toward the realization of reason in the world. It is not only the Enlightenment that Habermas wishes to revive, but a secularized version of Hegel. As a sociological basis for this iprogram, Habermas draws upon a particular version of Max Weber. Habermas interprets Weber as a cultural deter- minist. According to this view, Wjeber saw the driving force of world history as a long-term rationalization of worldviews in the West. From this flowed the type of personality dominated by the Protestant ethic, and the social institutions of modern capitalism, along with the rationalization of every other sphere of social life. Habermas claims he is following Weber, except to the extent that Weber was pessimistic about the rationalized society which had emerged in the twentieth century, the "iron cage" of bureaucratization and the heartless capitalist economy. Habermas intends to rescue the progress of reason, by claiming that it is the specifically capitalist version of rationalization that is I to blame for differentiating the system's requisites from the lifeworld. In e-ffect, capitalism has captured rationalization in a purposive-instrumental form; hence the task of social reconstruction is to free reason in all its dimensions from this narrower application. Habermas attempts to eliminate Weber's pessimism about the modern outcomes of this process, by reformulating his scheme in the context of twentieth-century philosophical Marxism. Habermas' end product is what he calls the critical theory of society. Before describing Habermas' system, it is worth commenting on the way in which he claims to draw upon Weber. Weber is an extremely complex theorist; in one side of his argument he emphasized idealistic factors, while in other areas he stressed material conditions and conflict. Habermas places all the emphasis on the idealist side; and he makes Weber into much more of a linear evolutionist thaa he actually was. Although Weber often analyzed the effects of ideas on social action, he just as often revealed the social conditions under which particular kinds of ideas arose. Without an autonomous unfolding of culture1, Habermas has much less grounds for his own theme of an immanent teleology toward reason in world history. Habermas shows very little interest in Weber's writings on material organization and interest groups. For Habermas, these provide only the "external factors" for the unfolding of the immanent logic of the rationalization of worldviews. But a different interpretation of Weber could say that these "external factors" are the driving mechanism in the whole development,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that the ideological sphere is derivative of them. In short, Habermas' view of world history is a good deal more like that of Talcott Parsons than what Weber actually said in many of his works. But let us now leave this point aside, and examine the system as Habermas constructs it. The Theory of Communicative Competence Habermas' basic strategy is to broaden the old conception of truth as objective knowledge, by placing it on a social foundation. In his earlier writings, Habermas discovered and discussed the work of George Herbert Mead (hitherto virtually unknown on the Continent) and his conception of thought as internalization of conversation. This places old epistemological problems in a new light. The problem of the isolated Cartesian ego attempting to deduce the existence of the external world dissolves once one realizes that thinking itself already implies the existence of other people, of an outside world from which thought is internalized. Cognition is social cognition. Habermas has never pressed the formal epistemological issue very hard, since he has always been more concerned with knowledge relevant to issues of social reform than with the precise extent to which one can establish the truth claims of any particular statement. It has been enough for him to guarantee some degree of objectivity in any statement, provided it is based on genuine social discourse. And since the social world has to a considerable degree a self-defining quality to it, Habermas can be content with the criterion of social agreement as sufficient grounds of objective truth. If a social movement can come to agreement, through open discussion, on its aims for reconstructing society "in the common public interest," then what further degree of objectivity might one want? At least so seems to run Habermas' line of reasoning. Habermas embodies a vestige of the 1960s New Left, with its participatory democracy and its Utopian ideals for social reconstruction. Add to this another popular movement, psychoanalysis, and particularly its most social form, the "encounter group," with its method of relentless honesty and self- revelation—and one has the background ingredients of Habermas' intellectual project. (The vogue of psychoanalysis in America, though, was in the 1930s and 1940s, while encounter groups have faded since the early 1970s. But in Europe of the 1980s, these remained relatively new movements of public interest, and they have inherited especially large hopes with the general decline in the popularity of Marxism.) Habermas, in other words, is something of a carryover from the activism of the 1960s. In many respects, this is probably a good thing, especially in our present era lacking in idealism and commitment. But it also gives Habermas certain liabilities from an intellectual point of view. . Habermas' main achievement is to broaden the concept of rationality. Traditional philosophy had confined this to propositional statements about the objective world or the logical connections of concepts. Habermas argues that ascertaining objective truths of this sort is only one kind of rationality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Habermas believes there is a standard of rationality for other kinds of speech acts than constative assertions. Modern linguistic philosophers, following John Austin, have pointed out that many statements have "illocu- tionary" force: They do not merely say something (like "My house is gray."), but do something (like "I hereby declare you husband and wife."). According to Habermas, such "regulative" speech acts as excuses and apologies, and institutionally bound speech acts such as marrying and oath taking are interpreted as kinds of normatively regulated social action. They can be judged according to their degree of Tightness in establishing interpersonal actions: That is, they are rational insofar as they conform to objectively recognized social norms. Hence such speech acts, too, are oriented toward reaching interpersonal understanding, and they can be criticized as to whether or not such understanding is reached, and whether the speech act was properly carried out according to accepted norms. Regulative speech acts thus have the same degree of objectivity as do constatives; the only difference is that in the latter case the referent is the natural world, in the former the social world. A third type of speech acts—expressives—do not have this objective reference, since their function is to externalize an individual's subjective experience. As social actions, Haberrrlas assimilates these to Erving Goffman's dramaturgical action, which he interprets as ways that one dramatizes to other persons the character of one's inner self. But even this subjectivity, and its aesthetic qualities in expression, are not exempt from the critical standards of rationality. For one's subjective world can be truthfully or falsely represented; hence there ii&gt; a possibility of reaching complete social understanding, provided that thej individual expresses him/herself honestly and effectively. To the extent that this does not happen, the procedure of open questioning—Do you realty mean that? Was that what you meant to convey?—can ultimately bring trie truth into the open. In this way, the whole world might be made transparent to social understanding, and rationally objective agreement established everywhere. Of course Habermas is not so naiive as to provide nothing but an idealized picture of communication. Often, perhaps most of the time, communication falls short of these high standards. One way in which this happens is via a fourth category of social action, which Habermas labels "strategic action." This is self-interested action, oriented toward controlling or influencing others rather than coming to! an understanding with them. Habermas includes Austin's category of "p6rlocutions" in this rubric, as speech acts oriented toward having a certain effect on the listener (confusing, embarrassing, flattering, and so forth). He also includes imperatives, as efforts to carry out one's own will rather than to arrive at a mutual agreement. Strategic action, of course, has .1 certain rationality, insofar as it can be judged according to standards oil effectiveness in achieving its aims. But it is a rationality that Habermas does not approve of, since (1) it is carried out by selfish means, and hence does not have the mark of social agreement which is central in Habermas' conception; and (2) strategic speech action</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermines the "rationality" of constative, regulative, and expressive speech actions, since its success depends precisely on deception rather than openness as to aims and means. Habermas admits that most everyday speech acts may contain an element of strategic action. But he believes that this is analytically secondary, and that such strategic elements can be removed. How is this to be done? In the same way as any other imperfections in communicative action can be remedied: that is, by open, unimpeded discourse. The method is simply that questions can be asked until satisfaction is attained. For constatives, one questions whether the objective and logical conditions really hold; for regulatives, whether the norm is properly applied (and on a deeper level, whether the norm itself is to be accepted by the group); for expressives, whether there is sincerity and also aesthetic effectiveness. Openness to free speech is the key, an openness which must continue unimpeded until uncoerced agreement is reached. Habermas thus provides an inspiring extension of the liberal tradition. Nevertheless, regrettably, one may question whether it is adequate either as social science, or as a realizable, or even a completely desirable, ideal in the world. As Social Science. Habermas' effort to assimilate speech-act theory to categories of social action is laudable. But the version of social science that he uses is not a particularly sophisticated one. His scheme is rather like that of the structural-functional categories of Talcott Parsons. In particular, Habermas takes the very important type of speech acts—regulatives—and interprets them simply as normatively regulated action. To rest explanation upon "norms," as in the manner of the sociology of the 1950s, is superficial, since this practice typically confuses (a) the sociological observer's description of a pattern of behavior; (b) an imputation that the actor has an internalized standard of the Tightness of that pattern; and (c) the theory that (b) explains or is the cause of (a). Normative theory in sociology, in other words, glibly jumped from description to explanation, without any empirical comparison of the conditions under which various patterns of action occur. It is largely for this reason that normative theorizing has faded away, and theories with more empirically explanatory leverage have taken its place. On the level of social action, Habermas uses the work of Erving Goffman, from whom he derives the category of dramaturgical action. He draws heavily on Goffman's early book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which Habermas interprets as being about how individuals express, or conceal, their subjective attitudes. In other words, Habermas picks up the popular, superficial impression of Goffman as how to be a con man in everyday life. Habermas then modifies this with his "rationality" theme, since if one can conceal something, nevertheless that implies a standard by which truthfulness can be established by unconcealing it. But this misses an important element in Goffman's analytical stance. First of all, Goffman is basically</p>
<p class="calibre1">a Durkheimian, for whom the world is a moral order which happens to be constituted by rituals. Goffman's innovation is to show that such rituals take place throughout everyday life. So Goffman (and Durkheim) is giving us a theory of the causal conditions under which normative ideals are created socially. Ideals, including moral ones, are not a deus ex machina with which to explain social structure; they are, rather, products of social interaction. And they are variable products: Different kinds of ritual interactions, based on different situations of social class and power, produce different cultures, which establish the boundaries of particular (and often antagonistic) social groups. Goffmanian sociology is not just another subtype of speech act, with an aesthetic and subjectivistic core, but is a major tool for establishing the priority of sociological explanations over disembodied normative ones. There is another respect in which Habermas misunderstands Goffman. Habermas thinks that Goffman is dealing with the expression or concealment of subjective states. But this is what Goffman explicitly denies. Much of Goffman's work is a crusade against the idea that there is a primordial subjectivity, which is then externalized by communication. As befits a Durkheimian viewpoint, Goffman argues that the self is actually a bundle of different things, really stances taken in various kinds of interactions. The self may be a "sacred object" to which we give ritual respect, but by the same token it is also a modern myth which actually fluctuates with the footings one takes in different levels of social interaction. As Realizable Ideal. Habermas' main concern, though, is not explanatory social theory but a practical guide to rational social reconstruction. This is a noble aim, and Habermas deserves to be honored for attempting it with such thoroughness against almost the entire weight of twentieth-century thought. But does his program promise success? Unfortunately, one might fear that it does not. His advice is that a situation of open discussion should be instituted, to go on until freely arrived at agreement is reached. The criterion of rationality is the existence of this discourse, the ability to put every speech action into debate, as a subject for questioning, against the standards of validity which Habermas has outlined. But we can still ask: Why and under what conditions would people actually engage in discussion of this sort? And if they did, would they arrive at the agreements he projects? Habermas proposes that people should give up the use of imperatives, the engaging in strategic action, the pursuit of individual self-interest. Instead they should pursue the "common interest of all." But this seems to be a statement of exhortation and faith. There is nothing in sociological theory that suggests that people will generally, everywhere, and as a rule, give up on strategic action, or that they would be able to construe "the common interest" in a fashion which would be satisfactory to literally everyone in the world. Habermas does not even explore the social conditions under which some people will be moved, some of the time, to act toward such ideals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ideal of a lengthy, or even endless, discussion on all questions is not as practical as Habermas thinks. Robert Michels' Iron Law of Oligarchy, by which democratic-participatory organizations are taken over by a self-perpetuating elite, is partly due to the fact that discussions are tedious. The more people who try to speak, the longer it takes to get agreement on anything. Hence the sheer structural difficulty of arguing through to a general social consensus is implicitly a program for turning society over to a few specialized intellectuals, those who are most committed to lasting out these lengthy debates. Habermas actually may be formulating an ideology for such intellectuals, aggrandizing their own interests in taking the forefront by claiming that they are acting out an ethical imperative. Habermas' ideal is naive from the point of view of contemporary sociology of science, concerned with exposing the social interests of intellectuals behind the objectified reality-constructing they perform. One can ask, too, whether most questions are actually likely to lead to agreement. Habermas thinks this is unimportant, that it is enough to show the criterion under which agreement might be framed. But this is a hollow achievement, if particular issues cannot actually be resolved. Is it realistic to assume that any amount of argument between, say, proponents and opponents of abortion could finally change their minds? And this is aside from the problem of the sheer limitations of cognitive capabilities. Discussion, no matter how extensive, will not solve problems of social planning if there are complex contingencies on the macro level which lead to unpredictable outcomes. Here, even if agreement were reached, it does not follow that rationally effective action would follow from it. As Desirable End. Habermas seems to envision the ideal society as an omnipresent encounter group, in which people everywhere will be questioning each other's every statement, and on every level. Constative, regulative, and expressive speech acts alike will be brought before the forum of group attention, and scrutinized until absolute truth, rectitude, and sincerity prevail. Perhaps this would be liberating, from the point of view of a certain ideal. But how would it be in real life? Leaving aside the fact that the discussion would be literally endless, taking up all of everyone's time and preventing anything else from being done, would we finally feel realized and made whole by this condition? I think, instead, that most people would revolt against this endless probing, this endless exposure. Although talk would ostensibly be going backward, digging toward its foundations, it would actually progress outward in time, building commentaries upon commentaries. It would produce a society of endless reflexivity. It would attempt to do what, in fact, Harold Garfinkel claims people in everyday life seek to avoid doing: falling into the pit of infinite regress of justifications and thereby making a cognitive chaos out of the taken-for-granted order of their lives. On the whole, then, Habermas' effort to reconstruct society as a Utopia of free and unconstrained communication appears to be a failure. But it is a heroic effort, and German sociology has again acquired world attention be-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cause such themes have even been raised. To be sure, other leading German sociologists, such as Niklas Luhman, have given a much more pessimistic vision of social constraints; and there are still other theoretical positions to be found. But the combination of philosophical depth and broad sociological concerns continues to be one of German sociology's most distinctive contributions. It is in German sociology that the Utopian and emancipatory tradition is most likely to be found in the world today. RANDALL COLLINS: CONFLICT THEORY AND INTERACTION RITUAL CHAINS We come, finally, to North America. Here sociology operates in a specialized mode. There is less crossing over disciplinary boundaries, less political addresses to the public. American sociologists would no doubt like to have this wider impact, but intellectuals here simply do not play such a role as public figures as intellectuals do in Europe. But it is a mistake to believe that American sociology is merely an empirical enterprise, and that we import all our theoretical ideas from abroad. In previous chapters, we have already seen that the United States has its own tradition of constructing theories: for instance, Cooley, Mead, and the symbolic interactionists, and more recently Goffman and Garfinkel. America's most notable strength has been in microsociology, but it also has a tradition of building comprehensive theoretical syntheses, such as that of Talcott Parsons. As a contemporary sample, we include a section on one of the present authors' efforts at constructing a comprehensive sociological theory. Randall Collins developed his theory during the 1970s and 1980s as a deliberate effort to cumulatively synthesize the sociological knowledge of the past century. His belief is that sociology has been gradually moving ahead, and can make still greater gains in the future. To be sure, sociology has always consisted of warring schools of thought, which prefer to emphasize their differences rather than their agreements, and tend to deny that anyone else has made much progress. But if we step back from the intellectual polemics, Collins believes, we can see a thread of developing knowledge from both theories and research. In its own way, sociology has been acquiring a core set of principles which make it into an explanatory science. The most important aspect of such a science, Collins holds, is not whether it states laws in mathematical form, backed up by statistical evidence. Often the nature of our laws is too complex to be stated in this way without losing their most important insights; and often the qualitative evidence—from historical comparisons, observational studies of organizations, participant observation, and interpretation of face-to-face interaction—has provided us with our most basic understanding of the way social processes work. This is not to rule out mathematical formulations and statistical research, but only to put them in proper focus, as contributors to a larger enterprise, rather than its central core.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Collins' view, sociology can be a science in the sense that it produces explanations of why things happen in a particular way at a particular time. That is, we look for the conditions under which something happens, and the conditions under which it does not happen; and we pay attention to the conditions which produce variations all across the board. We look for the fundamental generative mechanisms in human interaction, from which all the features of different societies are derived. But societies are complex and historically changing; and within any one society, there are usually many different social groups. The generative principles we are looking for must be capable of producing a great deal of complexity, and many individual differences. The key is that there are multiple generative mechanisms—not a huge number, but at least a few. For instance, as we will shortly see, Collins believes that power processes and status processes are fundamental building blocks of stratification and organization. It is by combining and re- combining these elements in many crosscutting combinations that sociology is capable of explaining the diverse behavior of individuals and their relationships, which make up the social structure. Collins takes his inspiration from theoretical principles of Weber and Durkheim, as they are backed up by more recent empirical research. From Weber, he takes the viewpoint that stratification and formal organizations are the two keys to all other areas of sociology. That is, virtually all groups can be seen as some aspect of stratification; and the institutions of human societies—political, economic, religious, educational, and so forth—are best analyzed according to the principles of organizational theory. If we can explain these two areas, we can derive most of the rest. Stratification of Order-Givers and Order-Takers Weber's theory of stratification is multidimensional, focusing on class, status, and power. Class refers to social divisions within the economic realm: the market relations of property and work. In Collins' view, this economic realm is not itself intrinsically organized; the very existence of classes depends upon the other two dimensions, status groups and power structures. Status always refers to groups, people who tend to associate together and to exclude outsiders. Status groups are one fundamental type of social network. These groups are a major influence of life styles and beliefs. As we shall see in Collins' micro theory, explaining status groups links Weber's theory with Durkheim's. Power, for Weber, is a crucial category because it refers to the state and its politics. In Weber's macro theory, the state is a crucial organization because it is the ultimate location of coercive force as well as of legitimacy. The state undergirds the economic system; capitalism would not be possible without the legal system which upholds property and regulates financial transactions. Weber's theory of the state, moreover, is his theory of bureaucracy, and of related kinds of formal organization. In this way, the three-dimensional theory of stratification (class, status, power) links to organization theory, since power refers to positions within formal organiza-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions. Weber himself was mainly concerned, in his macro theories, with the organizational structure of the military and the government. Collins broadens this theoretical emphasis. He treats power analytically. That is, power does not exist only in the realm of the state. There is a political aspect to every organization, including businesses, churches, schools, clubs—wherever there are formal structures divided into positions. In this sense, then, Collins proposes that the fundamental generative structure of economic class is really power. The way individuals make a living, their access to the material means of production, is most immediately structured by their power positions in organizations. On the micro level, then, power and class collapse into a single dimension. Collins then proceeds to build a theory about this dimension of power-classes. People who are in positions of power are order-givers in everyday life. The process of giving orders, and of being responsible for their organizations, creates a particular worldview and set of motivations. Order- givers tend to be proud, self-assured, energetic, and formal; they identify themselves with their organization and its ideals. In effect, order-givers indoctrinate themselves with their own ideologies, becoming true believers in the ideas by which they justify giving orders. Collins uses Goffman's model of interaction rituals in everyday life to explain this pattern. Order-givers are "frontstage" personalities; they are constantly putting on performances, acting out the official side of their organization. This is intrinsic in the nature of power. For power has to be enacted, over and over again in face-to- face situations; the order-giver must convince others that he or she represents the organization, which will back up whatever he or she demands. But an organization is nothing more than a coalition of persons, and the order-giver is putting on a performance to convey the belief that his or her power coalition exists. The order-giver, then, must be always thinking of the organization, acting out its reality. The order-giver has an "official" outlook on the world, because he or she is always performing power rituals. People who take orders have a different class culture. They are passive audiences of the power rituals carried out by their superiors. Consciously or unconsciously, they feel that these rituals are being used to push them around. Accordingly, order-takers tend to withdraw from official ideals. How much they withdraw depends on how coercively power is applied. In extreme power situations, order-takers become subservient, passive, and fatalistic, giving the dull compliance that was characteristic of slaves, serfs, and prisoners. Most of the working class today is not in such an extreme condition of powerlessness; accordingly, their class culture has shifted toward milder forms of alienation. Typically, there is cynicism about work and about bosses in general, and a tendency to identify with one's local group rather than with the organization and its official ideals. In our affluent modern societies, working-class culture consists in identifying away from formal organizations, placing most of one's emphasis upon one's leisure life. In Goffmanian terms, the working-class culture of order-takers is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"backstage" culture, emphasizing one's private life and displaying cynicism about what goes on on the frontstage. The dominant class of order-givers, on the other hand, consists of "workaholics," people who identify strongly with their careers, and who let these structure most aspects of their lives. The foregoing description, of course, picks out only two abstract points of the continuum of class situations. Some persons are very high-ranking order-givers, in whom the most extreme versions of frontstage, official worldviews are dominant; others are middle-level order-givers, those who have power in some relationships, but have to take orders from others, while still other face-to-face relationships take place between equals. Collins uses the order-giver/order-taker model as a set of generative principles, from which the various intermediate positions can be derived as well as the extreme positions. Collins' view of class conflict, then, is rather different from that of the orthodox Marxists. Power-classes exist wherever there are hierarchic formal organizations; they exist in Socialist societies as well as in capitalist ones, and in churches, schools, and many other realms as much as in businesses. Order-givers versus order-takers is a fundamental split, but one in which the two parties are usually quite unequal. For the order-givers are highly mobilized; they are already linked together in a network, and they are energized by their everyday interactions, while the order-takers tend to be localized, passive, and withdrawn. There is plenty of underlying strain between top and bottom in any organization, but this rarely comes out into overt conflict. Typically the order-taking class is fragmented, and its members withdraw psychologically from their formal organizations into their private lives. Most conflict, Collins proposes, takes place at a different level: between different factions of order-givers themselves. It is mainly the higher classes who are engaged in conflict with each other. Conservatives and liberals are both led by members of the order-giving class; the main difference between them is in the kinds of organizations in which they work, and with which they identify. If holding power, after all, is the mechanism which makes persons identify with ideals, it is not surprising that the people who are most committed to fighting for their ideals are order-givers. The underlying splits are usually between organizations rather than between power-classes. Conservatives tend to come from the business world, whereas liberals are more likely to be employed in the nonprofit sector such as government agencies, education, and the media. Even radicals like the Marxists themselves can be best explained by the organizational positions held by certain types of intellectuals: typically in elite universities well insulated from outside pressures, or sometimes (as has been more common in Europe) as full- time officials of labor unions or journalists in the left-wing press. Left- and right-wing political activists try to mobilize the masses beneath them, to awaken the slumbering antagonism between order-giving and order-taking classes. But this happens only seldom, usually depending on an organizational crisis which shakes up the whole structure. Most of the time, politics</p>
<p class="calibre1">is a maneuvering between rival groups of order-givers, who mask their own positions in their general statements of ideals and their claims to be representing the interests of lower groups. The Horizontal Dimension of Status Rituals There is a second dimension of social interaction which can crosscut the hierarchy of order-giving and order-taking. We can also ask: How tightly organized is the network of people who associate together? Here Collins draws on Durkheimian theory of social solidarity. Durkheim spoke of the "moral density" of interaction, which Collins prefers to call the "ritual density." Once again there are variables. How much of the time is an individual in the presence of other people? And are these always the same people, or are they different ones coming and going? If someone is constantly surrounded by people, and these people are always the same, the result is to subject the individual to very strong pressures for conformity. This group has a structure which Collins calls a "natural ritual." The process of interaction focuses people's attention on the same thing, and creates a strong sense of the boundary of the group. Symbols are generated which come to represent the group; and however arbitrary those symbols may be, the individual conforms strongly to them, and expects conformity from other people. This is what Durkheim called "mechanical solidarity"; it is the situation of isolated small groups, of certain tribal societies, and of rural communities. But Collins uses this model analytically: That is, there is an aspect of this kind of structure within modern society as well. Some persons live in localized, relatively closed groups, little pockets of high social pressure on the individual, which are the main carriers of traditionalism and moralistic conformity. At the other end of the continuum, individuals may spend very little time with a group, and when they interact they do so with a great variety of different people. When individuals are in this situation—more time alone or in privacy, and interacting with cosmopolitan networks rather than an unchanging local group—they tend to think relativistically and abstractly. This dimension, too, is an analytical one. Some persons are at the extremes of high or low ritual density, but there are also many gradations in between. And within the course of one's life, one may move in and out of different kinds of group situations. Small children, for example, are usually in a situation of high ritual density, always being in the presence of a small family group. Many of the characteristics of children's mentality and moral judgments follow from this structural situation, such as children's tendency to literal-mindedness and their expectations of complete conformity to the local customs with which they are familiar. Collins also proposes that adults can go through episodes of high ritual density; a couple in love, for instance, is creating a little private cult of extremely high ritual density, making each other into sacred objects. We can see now how society can contain many different individuals, each one with a somewhat unique personality. There are only a few basic</p>
<p class="calibre1">generative mechanisms, in Collins' view, but each person can have a slightly different combination of experiences on the dimensions of order-giving- and-taking and of ritual density. There are power experiences in different spheres of one's life: in all the different positions one has held at work, but also in the power structure of one's life at home, at school, and in other organizations. Not only do these experiences shape one's mentality as order- giver and order-taker, but these interactions will also have some degree of ritual density, which shapes one's tendency to identify with particular symbols and to expect conformity from other people. Every individual's "personality" is really the precipitate of all their social experiences as they have laid down their personal track through social networks. Interaction Ritual Chains Collins' later theory focuses on the dynamics by which individuals move through these dimensions of social experience. Collins proposes that each interaction is a kind of ritual, which can be analyzed as somewhere on a continuum of ritual intensity. Highly successful interaction rituals (IRs) are conversations in which the participants attain a strong focus of attention, create a common symbolic reality they believe in together for the moment. As the result of this, they come away with a recharged feeling of social solidarity. Collins calls this "emotional energy"; it is a generalized emotion of confidence and good feelings, a propensity to take the initiative, to act spontaneously in a certain direction. In what direction? Toward the persons and symbols which, in one's last set of encounters, have produced the most successful interaction rituals. For interactions also generate symbols: The things that one has talked about in a successful interaction become "sacred objects" in the Durkheimian sense, which symbolize membership in that little group. Each conversation in everyday life, banal as it may seem, nevertheless carries an unconscious freight of social meanings; gossip about friends can carry the significance of successful membership in some localized group of the recent past, just as certain buzzwords about politics, or technical terms used by a professional group, quickly signal who is a member of what larger network. Everyday interaction thus energizes certain symbols, by loading them with ritual significance as emblems of membership. Collins refers to this as "cultural capital" (a somewhat expanded version of what Bourdieu means by the same term). In Collins' model, interaction proceeds according to a kind of social marketplace. Individuals gravitate toward those interactions in which they have received the most favorable amounts of emotional energy. But interactions are not always successful. Individuals who have better "market position" may not be very interested in spending much time, or much intimacy, in exchanging symbols with some other individual; those who are "rich" in cultural capital and network connections will tend to seek out their best deal, and that will be with persons who can provide a similar exchange of cultural capital, not with someone who is "poor" in cultural capital and net-</p>
<p class="calibre1">work connections. Furthermore, some interactions take place in formal organizations, in which one side is an order-giver, the other an order-taker. These various interactions can either raise or lower one's emotional energy. Collins hypothesizes that successfully giving orders raises one's emotional energy, whereas taking orders reduces it. The result is that the order-giving class also comprises the more dynamic individuals, who take initiative in favor of their ideas (and thereby further their power); the order-taking class tends to be more apathetic. This is one of the hidden dynamics of stratification: It is a stratification of emotional energy, as well as of more obvious material goods. Emotional energy can also be won or lost on the horizontal dimension of status rituals. Being accepted into a group raises one's emotional energy, especially when the group is successful at generating a high level of emotional solidarity (which may be something as simple as laughing together at a party). But being rejected by the group lowers one's emotional energy and makes one depressed. Collins thus visualizes society as made up of long intersecting chains of interaction rituals. Each person comes into his or her next interaction with a past history, coded in the form of certain symbolically charged ideas, and a certain level of emotional energy. What will happen in the next interaction, though, has to be negotiated; it cannot be predicted in advance even if we knew all about the individual's cultural capital and emotional energy, because the interaction ritual is constructed by all its participants together. How the cultural capitals and emotional energies match up in that situation will determine how successfully the ritual goes, and who will be dominant or subordinate, accepted or rejected, superficial or intimate. At the end of the interaction ritual, each individual will come out of the situation with a renewed level of his or her emotional energy, whether up or down or constant, and with a set of cultural symbols which have been charged with the additional significance of group membership. Whether or not those particular individuals ever meet again, they have primed each other with the ingredients that will make up the next interaction. The Micro-Macro Connection Collins attempts to build up a systematic theory of the larger structures of society, starting from these micro chains. His argument does not reduce society to the individual. As we have just seen, it is the interaction that loads up the individual with motivations and ideas; personalities are precipitates of the experience individuals have as they move through chains of interaction. The basic unit is not the person but the chain of situations. The macro world consists of nothing but situational chains; "organizations," "states," "societies" are only words that people use, except insofar as there are real chains of individuals acting them out. Collins thus attempts to derive the principles of macro organizations as much as possible from the generative mechanisms operating in situations. For example, his organizational theory</p>
<p class="calibre1">uses the principles of conflict and control deriving from the mechanism of order-giving-and-taking, together with the mechanism of solidarity through ritual group density. But in doing so, Collins discovers the way in which the macro structure also exists in its own right. Organizations are nothing more than chains of social interactions, but the shape of these chains is itself a macro variable. The sheer number of persons and of interaction ritual chains, the way in which these chains are concentrated or spread out in space, and the amount of time over which chains form are macro variables. It is these that make up the macro structure, and they have a strong determining effect on what kinds of interaction rituals can take place within those chains. The individual personality is shaped by the local parts of the networks of interaction which make up the larger society. The upper power-classes, for instance, have their kinds of micro experience of giving orders because of the way they are located in the large-scale coalitions which link together organizational chains; the lower power-classes are equally fated by their peripheral locations, so to speak, at the loose ends of these chains. And other persons live in the middle realms of these networks, between the extremes. Ultimately, Collins proposes, sociology could provide a precise description of the factors operating on any given individual, setting their life chances as they construct their future ritual encounters. And on the macro level, we could translate the variables of political, organizational, and other ideological constructs into the real effects of micro generative mechanisms strung together in numerical patterns across time and space. IMMANUEL WALLERSTEIN'S WORLD SYSTEM Immanuel Wallerstein illustrates yet another side of current American sociology. In recent decades, there has been an upsurge of interest in historical sociology: that is, history as treated by sociologists themselves. Where most historians are specialized and avoid the theoretical implications of their own work, some sociologists have taken historical materials in order to make comparisons and construct explanatory models of the major features of society. Some notable works have been published in this vein, including Charles Tilly's resource mobilization theory of protest movements, based on his historical studies of revolutionary and nonrevolutionary movements in the history of France; Barrington Moore's analysis of the three routes to modernity—capitalist democracy, socialism, and fascism; and Theda Skocpol's comparative theory based on the great revolutions in France, Russia, and China. Perhaps the most ambitious of the historical sociologists is Immanuel Wallerstein. Working with a dedicated group of collaborators, and making use of a terrific range of historical sources, Wallerstein has developed a model of the entire world as a unit of social transformation. In Wallerstein's model, individual societies do not control their own fates. To understand the development of any particular society, we must</p>
<p class="calibre1">place it in the context of the world system. The capitalist world system which has come into being since the sixteenth century has relegated particular societies to positions of nondevelopment. To be more precise, the world is divided into a network between areas which are core and those which are periphery, together with those in the semiperiphery and in the external area. For Wallerstein, the term "world" is not to be taken strictly literally. A world system does not mean the whole globe, but a world-in-itself, a set of societies that are linked together but are relatively autonomous from what lies outside the set. There are two main types of world systems: world empires, which are tied together by a dominating state which extracts economic tribute from the others; and world economies, which have a multiplicity of political units tied together by warfare and by economic exchange. There is also a third possible type, a socialist world government, which does not exist, although Wallerstein believes it may in the future. Wallerstein doubts there truly are Socialist economies in the twentieth century, but only Socialist-controlled states within the capitalist world economy. The crucial distinction is between situations in which a conquest state dominates the economy by taking tribute (that is, a world empire), and those in which no state is strong enough to do so (a world economy). An imperial state, like ancient Rome or medieval China, limits the autonomous development of the economy. State officials are supreme and need make no concessions to low-status merchants; nor, in the absence of military competition among states, is there an incentive to rationalize the state apparatus and its economic policy. On this point Wallerstein follows Max Weber's ideas about the obstacles to early capitalist development. On the other hand, competition among states means that rulers must make concessions to mercantile and financial interests. The sheer pluralism of political power in the world system, then, is a crucial element in economic growth. Within a world economy, some states are stronger than others, politically and economically. These are the core states. They are able militarily and economically to dominate the periphery, thus creating an international division of labor among different types of labor systems. Cheap labor on the periphery (in the form of plantations, slavery, or other cheap-labor systems) builds up wealth for the core. This structure is crucial for several reasons. It enables the core states to have a free and relatively well paid labor force, thus reducing the amount of costly class warfare internally, and provides a mass consumer market for economic products. Core states tend to become cumulatively richer: Their wealth enhances their military power, which in turn increases their wealth. A core position also enables the state to escape the vicious cycle that tends to undermine state finances. States attempting to build up their military strength need officials to collect taxes, and money to pay their armies. But the state officials tend to eat up much of the wealth themselves. This was particularly so in medieval states, in which the nobility kept much of the revenue, and passed along the burden of taxes to the peasants below. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">the peasants were squeezed too hard, though, they were likely to revolt, which in turn raised still further the cost of controlling them militarily. There is a vicious circle of expanding power and the economic costs of supporting that power. This is a reason states tend to rise and fall, sometimes getting ahead of others in power, and then losing out as the costs of their wars and their domestic struggles for control mount up. Some powerful states, like Spain and France in the sixteenth century, got caught in ruinous wars against each other, and suffered internal economic crisis and social upheaval as a result. Hence they fell out of their core positions, and in the case of Spain, became part of the semiperiphery. The way out of this vicious circle, Wallerstein points out, was successful expansion into the periphery. Thus England, with lower military expenses and fewer foreign entanglements, emerged from the sixteenth century economically and politically stronger than its rivals, Spain and France. England went on to dominate the next phase of colonial expansion, into the Americas and Asia, reaping economic benefits from her colonies that enabled her to become dominant in Europe. But just as Spain and France had their rise and fall, so eventually did England; and the United States, which rose to become the most powerful core state of the mid-twentieth century, also seems destined to lose world hegemony. There is a mechanism behind this which Wallerstein attempts to isolate. The capitalist world-system process is inherently cyclical. The cycles are analogous to the periodic crises of Marxian economics (described in Chapter 2), except that in Marx's theory their periodicity is about ten years; in Wallerstein, about one hundred to one hundred twenty-five years. In effect, Wallerstein has enlarged the Marxian model from the internal dynamic of particular societies to the entire world system. Like Marx, Wallerstein too expects the cycles to end with a Socialist revolution; but for Wallerstein, the only kind of revolution that can truly transform the capitalist system must be a world revolution. Wallerstein's cyclical dynamics go as follows. Core societies have high- skill, high-wage economies of production; peripheral societies have low- skill, low-wage economies. Prosperity in the core societies depends upon their ability to exploit the low-wage periphery, and also upon the effective demand for the high-priced goods which their own labor force provides. An expansionary cycle (A phase) begins when the demand for high-wage goods (for example, manufactured products) is greater than the supply, and the demand for low-wage goods (for example, raw materials) is also greater than the supply. Hence the core societies expand their economic tentacles into new regions of the globe. This results in an increased flow of goods from the periphery, which in turn expands production of high-priced goods in the core. The whole world economy is in a boom phase. The turning point comes when the supply of goods from the periphery exceeds demand (B phase). Foreign expansion slows down, because it is no longer profitable. This causes core production to stagnate. There is a downturn in the growth of the world economy. Eventually the cycle bottoms out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During this time, capital becomes more centralized, preparing the way for a new expansion. The accumulation of capital is a recurrent process through each trough of the cycle. Also during the time of stagnation, unemployment and other economic miseries for the working class cause an upsurge of class struggle. The result is to force some redistribution of income. This increases demand for goods, setting the expansion cycle in motion once again. Wallerstein and his colleagues propose that there is a double cycle (A1-B1-A2-B2). The first cycle of the pair has a milder downturn than the second; at the end of the pair of cycles, there is an especially great crash, in which low-wage production not only stagnates but also contracts, and high-wage production (which is always more elastic) takes a very sharp drop. The political side of this cycle is not only that class conflict increases during the downturn phases, but also that rivalry between core states erupts into especially severe warfare at those times. It takes the entire double cycle, making up one hundred years or more, for political hegemony in the world system to shift, when the older hegemonic core state drops down and its place is taken by another. A new world power emerges during the Al phase, comes to predominance through Bl, reaches its height in A2, and declines in B2. The shift of hegemony from one core state to another is not accidental, but is tied to economic advantages. A state becomes hegemonic when its production, commerce, and finance exceed those of other states; hence, it can invest in the military force that enables it to dominate the international arena. But such hegemony always slips away. Ultimately hegemony depends upon a technological edge and upon relatively low internal costs of maintaining order. In order to keep class conflict within bounds, increasing concessions must be made to the workers. These concessions raise the costs of production. Since technology always diffuses away from its home country through imitation elsewhere in the world, another state with lower initial labor costs can seize the edge. Thus there is a continuous movement in and out of the core, and also in and out of the semiperiphery. As one can see, although Wallerstein is writing about the past, many elements in his model look like they are applicable to the current situation in which world economic domination by the United States is being challenged by Japan. Wallerstein sets forth his theory in a massive four-volume work, The Modern World-System. To date, three of the volumes have appeared. Each volume comprises one major cycle of the world system. Volume I describes the initial takeoff of the capitalist world economy in Western Europe from 1450 to its final crash around 1640; politically, this was the period of the rise and fall of the Spanish empire. Volume II goes from the crisis of the 1600s to another turning point around 1750; during this time the Netherlands rose to become a hegemonic empire, challenged by the absolutist regime in France and by the rise of English power. Wallerstein's Volume III deals with the period from 1750 to 1917; this is the period of what we conventionally call the industrial revolution, but in world-system terms it is the period of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">British Empire and its rise to overwhelming economic and political power. That period comes to its crisis in the world wars of the early twentieth century. In Wallerstein's long-term perspective, World Wars I and II (1914-1918 and 1939-1945) are really the same world military crisis, punctuated by an uneasy truce. They mark the turning point which will take up Volume IV: the twentieth century, in which Britain declined and domination passed to the United States. This cycle, too, if Wallerstein's model is correct, will have its closing crisis, sometime in the twenty-first century. Today's commentators are suggesting that the new successor to world hegemony is already on the horizon, in the shape of Japan. Wallerstein's fourth volume has not yet appeared, so we do not know the details of his prognosis. But Wallerstein does not expect that the cycles will go on forever. It is not necessarily the case that Japan will emerge as the core power of the capitalist world economy in the next century, because the theory also contemplates that the current cycle may be the last one. For one thing, the evidence suggests that the cycles have been growing shorter, presumably because the mobility of capital around the world has accelerated. Even more important, there are trends that have inherent limits. These are the trends to include a greater percentage of the world area in the capitalist world economy, a greater percentage of personal incomes in the form of wages (rather than unpaid coerced or traditional labor), and a greater percentage of capital in the form of machinery and goods rather than land. Once the reserves of unexploited land, labor, and nonmecha- nized production have dried up, the core states will no longer be able to expand into the external area. No new colonies can be created, no new societies added onto the periphery for the core to exploit. The basic mechanism of capitalist growth in the world system will have disappeared. Class conflict at a high level of mobilization will become unavoidable throughout the world. The system will only be able to survive this final crisis by transforming itself into something entirely new. Wallerstein's bet is that this final resting place will be a socialist world government. Wallerstein's projection of the future ending of capitalist cycles expresses the Marxian revolutionary theory in a new form. Marx's predictions of revolution within the leading capitalist societies failed because those societies drew their economic strength from their positions in the world system. The Communist states that existed during the twentieth century in Russia, China, and elsewhere came to power, not because of capitalist crisis in the economies of those countries, but because of the way former governments were destroyed in the wars engendered by the world system. It is for this reason that they are not truly socialist societies, as envisioned by Marx. Wallerstein thus reformulates the whole Marxian model, and proposes a logic by which Marx's predictions will come true in the end, but only on a much more massive scale. A crucial question nevertheless arises. From the perspective of the 1990s, can we still say that a Marxian analysis has any relevance? Did not the anti-Communist revolutions of East Europe and Russia during</p>
<p class="calibre1">284 The Vicissitudes of Twentieth-Century Sophisticatwn 1989-1991 change the nature of the whole ball game? The answer, surprisingly, may still be no. Wallerstein has argued that the world system as a whole has been capitalist for a long time; the socialist states tried to opt out of the system, but they could not. Whenever they engaged in international trade they did it on capitalist terms. At best they could act as a kind of a business corporation organized along socialist lines internally; but externally they had to deal with world markets and finances the same as any other capitalist. Thus Wallerstein argues that one of the reasons the socialist states fell was because they became tied into the capitalist world system to such a degree that their own economies were squeezed by capitalist competition; and their heavy investment in military expenditures could only make the situation worse. To understand the downfall of the socialist bloc, one of the key theories that we need may be the dynamics of the capitalist world. And we will need it even more in order to understand the future of Russia and the other fragments of its former empire as they become increasingly capitalist. The question remains whether this theory is true. Many elements of it are attractive, and may well be good approximations of how the world system affects the position of societies within it. In effect, Wallerstein tells us that the individual society is not a useful level of analysis, and that the causes of social change come from the outside in. This seems to be on the right track. But there are other aspects that are less convincing. How severe are the crises of the world economy? Are they severe enough to bring the whole system to an end? This is not to downplay the struggles and conflicts which take place within capitalism; but it is not yet theoretically convincing that these processes could not go on for centuries into the future, without coming to an end. Wallerstein projects that world socialism is the only transition point which can bring the cycles of world capitalism to an end. It is a good question, though, whether world socialism or any other stable resting point will ever exist, even hundreds of years from now. To whatever degree we are convinced by Wallerstein's model, its intellectual ambitiousness and scope cannot be denied. It shows, once again, sociologists at their best, taking up the major challenges of explaining what goes on in our world. Whatever modifications eventually need to be made in Wallerstein's theory, it is a guidepost toward a wider understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CHAPTER FIFTEEN The Impact of Women in Sociology in the Late Twentieth Century You may have noticed that most of the names dealt with in this book are men's. Some women have always been involved in the study of society, but until recently they have been submerged. Men have dominated the formative period of sociology, much as they have exercised domination elsewhere in society. This was also true in most other intellectual fields, including philosophy, history, and science; the main exception has been in literature, where women have had the most creative influence. It is with the women's revolution of the late twentieth century that male domination has been challenged and broken through; and it now appears that sociology at the turn of the twenty-first century is going to take a major part of its leadership from women. As with everything else, we can use sociology to explain how this pattern has come about. We need to combine two lines of analysis: the sociology of gender stratification and the sociology of intellectual life. Gender stratification has varied in degree throughout different periods of world history and different types of societies. In tribal and kinship-based societies, before the rise of the state, the position of women was often fairly favorable. In some of these tribal structures the religious system and the symbols and myths centered on females. But the influence of women in the ideological sphere did not carry over into the intellectual specialties of philosophy and science, for the simple reason that these specialties did not exist, for either men or women. What knowledge existed was embedded in practical or religious activities; there were no separate communities of intellectuals to carry on specialized research and build up their own traditions of thought. One of the ironies of history is that as the so-called civilizations arose, with their urban-based upper classes and their literate traditions, the intellectual traditions that emerged were largely monopolized by men. This male monopoly over the means of intellectual production was part of a larger pattern in which men controlled the structures of politics and economics as well. This is not to say there were no splits and conflicts among men; but the intellectual battles, as well as the political, religious, and 285</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic ones, were largely carried out between one faction of men and another. Women were not homogeneous either, but they were carried along in the class structure of male society. Thus upper-class women were largely confined to status-oriented activities around the household; women were sometimes idealized as members of the aristocracy, or prized as sexual objects and confined to harems; in either case their sphere was restricted and separated from men, who controlled the realm of production. Things were different with women of the working class; they did a great deal of work, but it was the dirty work relegated to servants, or the tasks of manual labor in such areas as textiles and farming. So neither the women of the upper nor of the lower classes had many opportunities to become intellectual leaders. Even the women who specialized in religion did not have the resources of men, who were priests and monks; women could become devotional mystics but not theologians. The one intellectual arena in which women had advantages was literature. This was especially true in the times when literature was centered around upper-class courts and the salons of the aristocrats. Thus we find in ancient Greece the famous woman poet Sappho, prominent in the literary circle on the island of Lesbos. In medieval Japan, for a period the great writers were all women, including Lady Murasaki Shikibu, who wrote the epic Japanese novel The Tale of Genji. It is not surprising that the contents of the great novels centered on a combination of love affairs and the careers of upper-class families, because this arena of sexual intrigue and marriage politics dominated the lives of people in the upper-class households. This was a realm in which men and women both participated, and the early novelists tended to be women who specialized in their observations of what was going on around them. One might even say that the earliest sociological research and analysis took form in these novels; where the men writers were busy idealizing the exploits of warriors and conquerors in their unrealistic epics, the women writers were taking a cool and realistic look at the backstage maneuverings that made up the real content of upper-class life. Thus in Europe some of the first sociologists appear in the guise of novelists; Jane Austen and Charlotte and Emily Bronte dissected the world of the marriage market and the status struggles of the middle and upper classes even before a more formal sociology emerged with Comte and Marx. Let us consider now how ideas develop in intellectual disciplines. Creativity typically occurs in social networks. The individuals whose ideas become influential are usually connected to other thinkers who are already in the center of intellectual life. Using Bourdieu's term, one can say that cultural capital is passed along in these networks; in Collins' analysis, creativity is a kind of emotional energy that builds up in their interactions. We have seen many instances of this throughout The Discovery of Society: Comte comes from the main network of Paris intellectuals and he gets his start as secretary to Saint-Simon; Marx and Engels begin in the network of the revo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lutionary Young Hegelians in Germany who branch off from their master, Hegel. Durkheim was in a group which led the reform of the French universities around the beginning of the twentieth century; Weber grew up in the main German political and intellectual network at Berlin and later became the center of a network at Heidelberg. If we apply this model of intellectual life to the position of women, we can see that one of the ways in which women got excluded from intellectual influence was that they usually were not allowed into these male networks. The most important intellectual capital was being passed along in places that typically were not open to women. Some women, however, were able to get into the networks; at first, this happened mainly through their family connections. For instance, the first woman to become truly famous in psychology was Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud's daughter. This was true for the novelists, too. Mary Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein, was the daughter of the famous anarchist writer William Godwin and the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, and she married the famous poet Percy Shelley. Mary Ann Evans, who took the masculine pen name George Eliot, became a famous novelist in the 1860s after she began living with one of the members of the intellectual circle in London around Herbert Spencer and the evolutionists. Max Weber's wife, Marianne Weber, was a noted scholar in her own right; she was one of the leaders of the German feminist movement in the early twentieth century, and she wrote a comparative history of the legal rights of women which influenced her husband's comparative sociology.1 Family and personal connections, though, were usually not a strong enough basis for women to become the influential leaders of the intellectual world. These connections provided a foot in the door, but they needed to be expanded before women would start to have a distinctive impact in a field like sociology. One arena in which women independently moved into positions of leadership was radical political movements and their more moderate reformist counterparts. Rosa Luxemburg was the first woman to make a major contribution to Marxist theory. She developed the analysis of imperialism in the early twentieth century, arguing that capitalism could survive only as long as there was a noncapitalist market outside of it where it could find consumers for its surplus production. Capitalism thus rested on its overseas colonies and its spheres of influence in what we now call the Third World. According to Luxemburg, capitalism would collapse as soon as it had brought the whole world into one big capitalist market. When the 'Many of the distinguished women sociologists in the earlier generations of the twentieth century were related to men sociologists. Helen Lynd co-authored the pioneering community studies of "Middletown" with her husband Robert Lynd; the "Thomas principle" (if situations are defined as real, they are real in their consequences) was jointly published by W. I. Thomas and his wife Dorothy Swaine Thomas. Jessie Bernard, the pioneering sociologist in the study of male and female spheres, was married to Luther Bernard, an early president of the American Sociological Association; Helena Lopata, an important sociologist of the family, is the daughter of Florian Znaniecki, whom we met in Chapter 10.</p>
<p class="calibre1">monarchist government of the German Kaiser fell at the end of World War I, Luxemburg helped to lead a left-wing uprising that attempted to establish a socialist state. The revolt was crushed by conservative forces, however, and Luxemburg was killed in 1919 in Berlin. At about the same time in the United States, Jane Addams was pursuing a more reformist version of Rosa Luxemburg's attempt at social revolution. Inspired by a visit to the program for workers' education that was developing in London in the late 1800s, she founded Hull House in Chicago, one of the pioneering institutions in social work. She was a leader in the crusade for humane treatment of new immigrants to America, for overcoming the conditions of slum housing in the cities, and for factory inspection to guard against dangerous work conditions. She fought for protection of children and for the rights of women, including the campaign for women's suffrage. For her pacifist activities, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Addams had connections with the early sociologists at the University of Chicago; and George Herbert Mead threw his political support to the activities of Hull House and the reform movements in Chicago. We should note the difference, though, between the kinds of influence that the men at the university had and the influence that Addams had at Hull House. The male sociologists, although active in various social reform movements, had their greatest long-term influence in the style of research that was carried out and in the general theories they developed. Reform movements and practical activities, by their very nature, tend to be embedded in local conditions. The issues of slum housing in Chicago and of factory regulation at the turn of the century have been forgotten with the passage of time; other local issues have emerged and superseded these. The theoretical schemes tend to be more permanent, since they are more easily passed along to subsequent generations through the intellectual networks. George Herbert Mead's theories of the mind and the social self are better remembered than his participation in Chicago reforms. Jane Addams had a powerful impact upon the social reforms of her day, and she left her legacy in building up the profession of social work. Still, the theorists and the researchers whose findings become part of our general picture of the patterns of social life have a long-term advantage, because their ideas become propagated through the intellectual networks and the educational system and are transplanted to many different contexts. Jane Addams and other women like her (along with men whose careers were centered on social work) did not become central figures in the development of sociology because of this difference in where they are located in the networks. The scholars who dominated the academic system of sociology had a wider sphere of influence because they controlled the more general and abstract ideas; and these scholars continued to be predominantly men. Perhaps we can see now why the impact of women in the intellectual core of sociology waited until the last part of the twentieth century. By the 1960s, two major developments occurred simultaneously. One was that women began to become a considerable proportion of university students;</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the 1970s, there were more women than men students. Women were closing in on the core academic networks where the main traditions of ideas were being developed. And in the 1960s, there was a massive student movement on university campuses, connected to the civil rights movement to end the segregation of blacks from whites in the United States. Activists called this simply the Movement, since it comprised many different branches, including civil rights, opposition to nuclear arms and to the Vietnam War, and later the women's movement. As we have just seen, women had become influential leaders in radical and reform movements several generations before women had won more than a foothold in the academic world. By the 1960s and 1970s, everything was coming together: Women political and social reform activists now were riding a wave with the expanding presence of women in the universities themselves. It is not surprising that the major impact of women in sociology dates from this time. Women from the student generation of the 1960s and 1970s have become a large proportion of the leaders of sociology at the end of the twentieth century. Where previously women had practiced sociology under a different guise—as in literature—or were lodged in practical activities, they are now at the core of the discipline. This period begins what one might call the Golden Age of women in sociology. The following sketches just a few of their contributions. A REVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF REVOLUTIONS: THEDA SKOCPOL The 1960s made American students aware of massive social conflict to a degree that did not exist for a long time before or since. One could no longer assume that the state was always the good guy, the democratic guarantor of law and order; some of us who lived through that period remember the police dogs that were unleashed on the crowd of civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, and other violent repression by the respectable agents of society. The authors of this book were in the concerned crowds that gathered when voting rights volunteers in the South returned to their college campuses after the summer of 1964, when several of their fellows had been murdered by deputy sheriffs in Mississippi. The atmosphere grew increasingly polarized; university officials often joined in the crackdown on the civil rights demonstrators, obstructing them from organizing on campuses to demonstrate against racial segregation in the surrounding communities. Most students in this phase were committed to what was called "nonviolent direct action"; taking their inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi's movement to free India from the British in the 1940s, they put their bodies in the way of their opponents but offered no resistance when force was used against them. One of the authors remembers carrying a sociology book into a huge demonstration at the administration building in Berkeley, which we were occupying nonviolently to protest the suspension of several students</p>
<p class="calibre1">who had led civil rights demonstrations. The sociology book was by Georges Sorel—it is described in Chapter 6 of this book—and the setting made for a wonderfully vivid lesson of how group solidarity arises from taking part in a conflict when one feels one is morally right. It was our experience of minirevolution; for a few tumultuous days the work of the university ground to a halt while everyone focused on the student revolt, and eventually the university gave in and granted new political rights for students on campus. Events like this took place on many student campuses across the United States during those years. The tactic of nonviolence was not always maintained; and things heated up especially in the latter part of the 1960s as the struggle for civil rights boiled over into violent uprisings in many black communities. In the summer of 1967, fighting raged for several weeks in the streets of Detroit and Newark, and dozens of people were killed. Other issues came in, including the demonstrations against United States participation in the Vietnam War. Conflict escalated, and then began to decline. By the early 1970s, some measure of civil rights reform had been enacted, most of the official segregation was abolished, and both the black communities and the university campuses settled down. For students who lived through that period, social movements, conflict, and revolution were not abstract ideas, but vivid realities; we believed we knew what they were about. Of course nothing like a real revolution ever beset the U.S. government during that period; there were minirevolutions in particular communities and on one campus or another. Nevertheless all this left a residue in the thinking of sociologists who grew up in that setting. Part of this was the recognition that revolutions could occur without necessarily falling into the classical Marxian scenario; a revolution did not have to be set off by an economic crisis, and it did not have to involve the uprising of an economic class. Theda Skocpol was the young sociologist who most thoroughly reaped the consequences of that insight. Skocpol was a student at Michigan State University during this period. In her autobiographical sketch, she describes herself as coming from a small-town midwestern family to a huge university during the boom in student enrollments. There was something for everyone: Football, fraternities, and sororities for those who wanted a good time; serious study groups for others; and enough student political activists, too, to sweep one into the sense of the larger movements that were happening across America. Skocpol joined a civil rights education project in Mississippi, where she met her husband; she credits her marriage to an egalitarian male as one of the factors that encouraged her career at a time when women—especially married women—were not taken very seriously in the academic world. As we know, intellectual creativity usually involves linking into the network of important thinkers of the previous generation; and Skocpol did this with her next step, going on to graduate studies at Harvard and picking up the key advances of the time. Just a few years before, the Harvard scholar Barrington Moore, Jr., had published his monumental comparative work on the trajectory of revolu-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tions in agrarian societies. Moore was concerned not so much with the causes of revolutions as with their outcomes; he asked why some revolutions led to capitalist democracies, others to communism, and still others to Fascist authoritarian regimes. Skocpol saw that the causes still had to be explained: Why do the major revolutions happen in the first place? The result appeared in 1979 with her book States and Social Revolutions. The focus was the three great revolutions which transformed the modern world: the French Revolution of 1789, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Revolution of 1949. Skocpol reverses some long-standing Marxian ideas. Revolutions are not caused, she asserts, by economic contradictions bursting through the bonds of existing political relations, and revolutionary agents are not rising social classes. New economic organizations and new classes appear not before, but after a successful revolutionary transformation. Thus the French Revolution cleared the way for large-scale markets and for the bourgeois class to appear in the nineteenth century; the Russian and Chinese revolutions created socialism at the same time that they created a mass industrial working class. It used to be believed that the socialist revolutions were anomalies, skipping stages in the natural sequence from feudal to capitalist to socialist economies. Not so, Skocpol argues; the revolution creates the economic structure that comes after it. The main causes of revolutions are not economic at all, but political. This is not to say that politics is just a free play of power, and that revolutionaries can do whatever they wish if only they have the will. The crucial point is that politics too is grounded in a structure, the state; and the state goes through its own crises. Borrowing a theme from Weber, Skocpol points out that the state has interests of its own. These interests are above all international: political chiefs are concerned about their international prestige, and hence with the military power that enables them to get prestige. If the state faces outward, it must also look inward; the leaders of the state must compete with the dominant classes inside their boundaries for the economic surplus to put to use in paying their military bills. As a number of historical sociologists have shown since Skocpol wrote, the administrative apparatus of the state grew up initially as a device for supporting armies and navies; eventually the state bureaucracy became so big that it needed huge sums to support itself. Skocpol broadens the way we think about class conflict. The members of the state thus constitute a kind of social class. They represent a distinctive way of making a living: by military and administrative appropriation. The state, we now see, is not merely political; it is also an economic agent in its own right. If the state is military at its core, we have the starting point of a new theory of revolutions. Revolutions are not possible as long as the military apparatus of the state holds together. The most basic condition for revolution is the breakup of the army and internal security forces which keep the state in power. Previous theorists of revolution had concentrated on other factors which miss the central point. One cannot simply point to the motivation of the rebels; whether they are motivated by economic grievances, relative de-</p>
<p class="calibre1">privation, or cultural strain, they still can have little effect as long as the state maintains its military strength. What, then, causes military breakdown? Here Skocpol turns to her comparison of the great revolutions. France, Russia, and China all had the potential to be Great Powers on the world scene, but were overextended or poorly organized militarily. Their efforts to keep up with more powerful states brought about fiscal crises in the state budget; for some of these states, too, there were actual defeats on the battlefield which disintegrated the armies. Moreover, one could see the revolutionary crisis coming long before the event, because the international dynamic behind it had been going on for a long time. States attempt to keep up with their military rivals, and whatever their enemies do they must emulate. Thus the French in the 1700s felt it necessary to keep up with the naval power of the English; the Russian rulers around 1900 attempted to modernize to keep up with the European states; China's reforms responded to Japan and to the Western colonial powers. In attempting to keep up with outsiders, rulers introduce changes which in the long run tend to seal their own fates. For revolutions to be truly major, the military breakdown above and outside must be combined with pressures from within and below. The older theories of revolution are not entirely wrong; the uprising of mass movements is part of the dynamic that makes a revolution especially sweeping in its effect. Skocpol notes that there are several different types of revolutions. In the first category are the so-called Great Revolutions, in which there is not only a political but also a social transformation, and in which these changes are accompanied by a class upheaval. In the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions, these class uprisings took the form of peasant rebellions. Another type of revolution, however, consists essentially of political revolutions. Examples of these include the English revolutions of the 1600s, which brought about the dominance of liberal parliamentary government, and the American Revolution of 1776-1783. There are also nation-building revolutions of the sort that have happened throughout the Third World in the middle of the twentieth century. In all these cases, the main dynamic is the breakdown of the military control of the old ruling apparatus. In other words, there is a breakdown at the top and a resulting revolution in political structures; but in the case of a merely political revolution this does not coincide with a massive uprising at the bottom that feeds into transforming the entire social structure. Skocpol weaves together her historical comparisons to prove her point. France, Russia, and China had the conjuncture of external-plus-internal crises. On the other hand, England had a political revolution, triggered by a fiscal strain based on its foreign policy expenditures; but there was no social revolution, since the crisis from above was not accompanied by a peasant revolt from below. Similarly, the Meiji Restoration in Japan, which overthrew the rule of the Shogun in 1867 and set off the period of rapid modernization, was the result of a military crisis as outside powers intruded into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Japan; there was no massive internal upheaval, and the brief civil war was among different factions of the aristocracy. In the "Great Revolutions" of France, China, and Russia, there were structural bases for internal revolt as well as for state breakdown. In all of these places, there were long-standing problems of the rural economy, and these were pushed to the point of revolt by the very efforts of the autocratic state to reform from above. Following up the themes of her teacher Barrington Moore, Skocpol points out that these governments unwittingly built up the ability of the peasants to revolt. The aristocrats were often removed from direct supervision of the day-to-day work on the farms, leaving the peasants alienated against a distant ruling class. And the government encouraged a collective organization of the peasants in each local area; this was done for administrative purposes of making it easier to collect taxes, but it had the effect of giving the peasants an organizational base which they could use in mounting a revolt. Once the central apparatus of the state broke down from external pressures, these internal conditions guaranteed that the social revolt would be very powerful indeed. One of Skocpol's major contributions comes at the point where most theories of revolution ended. She asks: Why is revolutionary reconstruction possible after the initial breakdown? Most of the other theories never raise the question at all, since they apply only to the initial phase. Yet there is no intrinsic reason the state should reemerge, and in a more centralized and strengthened form at that. Why shouldn't the state just keep on fragmenting after the first round of revolution, until it ends up in small parts or is swallowed up by foreign conquerors? Why does the state come out of these Great Revolutions vastly strengthened? The logic of Skocpol's argument is that the structural conditions behind the major social revolutions are ultimately in the military apparatus and in its international relations. The long-term cause of the military breakdown was that these states attempted unsuccessfully to expand their military capacity. In order to do this, prerevolutionary states tried to extract more surplus from their own population by tightening up their internal controls. These states became paralyzed in an effort to do this; for their own aristocracies resisted the efforts of the state bureaucrats to squeeze more taxes out of these economies. The effort of the state to become externally stronger led to internal conflicts, and this is what finally precipitated the process of revolution. In the long run, the revolution enabled the state to do better what it had set out to do initially: to become more streamlined and more powerful. It just happens that the old rulers of the state were no longer around to see this outcome; neither were their main opponents, the aristocrats who tried to stand in their way. The leaders of the revolution, in every case, came from the class of minor officials, the cla^s that was most involved in prerevolutionary administrative reform. They were not the Marxian class rising from the new economy; in France, they were not the rising bourgeoisie breaking through the ranks of the aristocracy; in Russia and China, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were not the workers rising up to challenge the bourgeoisie. They were instead the aspiring administrators, those who were acquiring new positions as the state bureaucracy expanded. In the great revolutions, a two-edged crisis broke out around these cadres of the expanding state. Militarily things broke down at the top, leading to fiscal crisis and the disorganization of the army; socially the peasants were revolting from the bottom, often with destructive violence. Both of these crises were solved by the revolution. The military crisis eventually was overcome because these states had the potential resources to build a powerful apparatus of coercion; the old-line aristocrats who stood in the way of the expanding state were destroyed in the peasant revolt. The peasants, on the other hand, supplied the energy of the revolution but they were in the wrong place in the structure to reap its rewards. They could destroy but they could not take over. What did take over was the centralizing state, now in the hands of its young, junior officials. When the other pieces of the wreckage of the old regime were swept away, they were left on the center of the stage. Skocpol's argument in 1979 made a powerful impact because it answered one of the big questions left over from the Marxist theory of revolution. Why didn't the Communist revolutions in Russia, in its Eastern European satellites, and in China lead to a withering away of state power? Why wasn't the result of the revolutions an increase in human freedom? Why instead did they give rise to highly centralized forms of authority, and to totalitarian dictatorship? Skocpol showed that the state is the central focus in leading up to a revolution; it is a battle all along over how powerful the state is going to be, and how many resources it is going to extract from the rest of society. History of course moves along. There have been other revolutions besides the great social revolutions of France, Russia, and China. Many of these have fitted Skocpol's model of political revolutions which occur without much change in the social structure; and here too her model of external pressures and military/fiscal breakdown has done good service. By the late 1980s, it was apparent that the Russian state itself was breaking down; first it lost control over its East European satellites, and then by the early 1990s it was undergoing an anti-Communist revolution on its home ground. Is the advance in sociological theory which Skocpol represents capable of explaining these processes as well? Some of the main elements of her theory play an important part. The Soviet state began to break down at the center before popular movements were allowed to mobilize against it from below. Military and fiscal strain weakened the center; factional battles broke out between rival groups of conservatives and reformers over how to improve the power of the state. As these struggles intensified, the Russian-dominated Soviet Union was no longer able to control its East European satellites; the breakdown at the center spread to the periphery. Skocpol's model of state breakdown through international military relations once more shows one of the keys to a revolution.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, can we call this a great revolution, a social revolution as well as a political revolution? As of the early 1990s, there is clearly a path toward a social revolution as well, as reformers attempt to radically dismantle the Socialist economies and replace them with capitalism. This is a great surprise for a Marxian theory, but it is not so strange for Skocpol's model; after all, she indicates that the economic structures and classes tend to be formed as the result of revolutions, rather than beforehand as causes of them. Perhaps we will come to see history as more like a series of grand flip-flops, with the switching mechanism coming from the international arena of military strains and budget crises. When such a crisis coincides with internal conditions which organize a class revolt, the economy is switched: from capitalism to socialism, or the other way. Probably we have not seen the last of this sort of dynamic. Here Skocpol's work brings us up to the frontier of our knowledge. She has not been alone in working on the theory of revolutions. We now understand much more about the various kinds of revolutions; we understand more about the economic role of the state inside a society, and about the geopolitical principles which affect the power of the state externally. The "minirevolutions" of the United States during the 1960s, which attuned a generation of sociologists to think in new ways about revolutions, have paid off with a broader theoretical understanding of the dynamics which change our world. Through work like that of Theda Skocpol, sociology's older traditions are revised and expanded; doubtless the generation of her successors will take them even farther. BUILDING THE THEORY OF GENDER STRATIFICATION: RAE BLUMBERG, JANET CHAFETZ, AND JOAN HUBER As a member of the 1960s generation, Theda Skocpol became attuned to the issue of revolution. Other women of that generation focused on the issue of the women's revolution. The feminist movement has a long history, going back to the activists of the 1800s who fought for women's rights. With the achieving of women's right to vote in the United States, England, and other countries around 1920, this so-called "first wave" of feminism died down. A small group of activists kept the issue alive, but the larger public was not listening. The 1950s was a period when the public ideology stressed the role of women as mothers and homemakers and denied that women should be working at careers outside the home. Ironically, this was a time when the white-collar work force was expanding to include a very large number of women: but in positions such as secretaries, taking orders from men. Other features of the situation were undermining the ideology of separate male and female spheres. If women were expected to devote their lives to bringing up a family, the first order of business was to get married, and this meant finding a man. And since middle-class men were now all attending college, women had a good reason to go to college too. But once they were there, other possibilities for women arose besides the marriage mar-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ket: learning about professional careers, becoming intellectuals or political activists. When the student movement took off in the 1960s, women were very much a part of it. Thus the "second wave" of the women's movement began in the late 1960s, as a branching off from "the Movement" for civil rights and peace. The best-known feminist theorists of that period were especially likely to come from literature. This is not surprising, in the light of the fact that women first made their mark in the intellectual world as novelists and poets. Literary critics like Kate Millett and Germaine Greer wrote critiques of male domination and of the ideologies that uphold it. Marxist activism had been the other arena in which women intellectuals had gained a hold; so we find the use of Marxian theory by feminist writers like Juliet Mitchell and Shulamith Firestone. It was an expanded Marxian tradition, featuring not only class struggle but also sexual domination based on patriarchy and relations of reproduction. A number of feminist writers drew also on Freudian theory, purged of Freud's own male biases and modified to account for the roots of gender inequality. In Chapter 8 we reviewed Nancy Chodorow's theory of mothering, which attempts to explain gender inequality in terms of personality differences deeply rooted in early childhood. The traditions of women intellectuals were strongest in literature and in psychoanalysis, and specifically sociological contributions to feminism were a little slower to receive attention. Nevertheless sociology was in an especially good position to explain the dynamics of gender change. The issues are essentially these. Cultural and psychological approaches to gender inequality are good at description and critique; one is able to show how deep and pervasive are the aspects of male and female differences and inequalities. The resulting picture, though, is a static one. If there are many subtle and deeply rooted processes reproducing the system of male domination, how is it possible to change them? Cultural and psychological models of gender domination must end up either as pessimistic or as putting their hopes on a sudden, almost miraculous, change in consciousness. Marxian theories, on the other hand, have a dynamic of change; but they have a problem in applying this specifically to gender. For one thing, gender stratification existed before capitalism, and it continues to exist in the Socialist societies; accordingly, there is an additional process of gender stratification which exists over and above class domination. This is usually labeled "patriarchy." But to label something is not to explain it; and there is still the problem of showing how this "patriarchal" inequality rises and falls. If "patriarchy" is immutable, then we are back with the same problem as the cultural and psychological theories, unable to show a path toward a different future. Sociology is in an excellent position to solve this problem. For sociology is the theory of the causes and effects of social patterns; and if most sociologists did not take a very good look at gender inequality before the 1960s, there was nothing to prevent the new generation from doing just that. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">order to understand the causes of a social pattern, we need to examine the widest range of variation we can find, and to isolate the factors which make the difference. Max Weber, for instance, had done this in looking at state, religion, and economy across world history, trying to isolate the factors which gave rise to modern capitalism. Durkheim had done something similar with his comparison of mechanical and organic solidarity. In the mid- 1960s, Gerhard Lenski had assembled the data on economic inequality across societies ranging from small hunting-and-gathering bands up through the great agrarian empires and the systems built upon industrial technology. When sociologists began looking for the general causes of gender inequality in the 1970s, they drew upon this comparative method. A number of women sociologists were involved in this kind of comparative analysis, including Rae Lesser Blumberg, Janet Saltzman Chafetz, and Joan Huber. (Some men worked in this area too, but they have received enough attention, so we will leave them aside here.) The resulting theories play up different aspects of the situation, but there is an overall viewpoint which has been supported by different angles of approach to the evidence. So we can describe the building up of a general theory of gender stratification. Among the most colorful of the comparative sociologists of gender is Rae Lesser Blumberg. She has pursued comparisons from many sorts of data. From the library and the computer files she makes use of the anthropological comparisons in the Human Relations Area Files, as well as the kinds of historical accounts that Lenski used to study economic inequality in medieval agrarian societies. Rae Blumberg is also a field researcher of world-ranging scope. Coming from the idealistic generation of activists of the 1960s and early 1970s, she joined the Peace Corps and was sent to South America. Revolutionary and anti-American movements abounded. On the other side, U.S. agencies were active in trying to head off Communist influence in the hemisphere, pushing both covert and overt programs. Rae Blumberg found herself in the middle of all this. The Peace Corps and the Agency for International Development (AID) worked directly with the poor, trying to foster economic development; and this brought American staff members into the arena where the movements of discontent thrived. At the same time, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the military attaches worked through the U.S. embassies, coordinating military aid to forces that were considered to be friendly to the United States, and attempting to undermine movements and even governments that were considered unfriendly. Blumberg describes the situation in Bolivia in the early 1970s. The government, which had come to power in a previous coup, was considered too left-wing by the United States, which supported conservative generals attempting to overthrow it. On the other side were ultra-left guerrillas. Between the two, rumors of impending coups swept through the capital every few weeks. From time to time, one had to duck gunfire in the streets, or hope for luck in not being at the places where a bomb blew up. The cir-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cles of embassies and international organizations were full of deception and intrigue. Arms merchants and arms purchasers mingled under varied cover, ranging from the Middle East to militarized Asian bastians like Taiwan and Korea. Blumberg found that she was being followed by the representative of an American religious charity, apparently an agent who was suspicious of her knowledge of U.S. plans to bring down the leftist Bolivian government by economic manipulations. Pulling connections, she got herself out of Bolivia. Over the years, both in her Peace Corps days and later, Blumberg has continued her firsthand comparative studies. To understand the position of women, she argues, one must see their position within the economic division of labor. And to understand why these positions differ, one must see a wide range of such arrangements. Blumberg has flown into the remote jungles of Venezuela, to study horticultural tribes where raiding and female infanticide were practiced. She has studied the Indian tribes of the Andes, some of which had old traditions of female crafts which constituted a crucial part of economic production. The harsh realities of politics and violent conflict were often present. Working in Guatemala in the 1980s, she came across whole villages that were burned out by government forces, destroying the population to put down resistance movements and keep a dictatorial government in power. In Venezuela, she wrestled with an attacker who broke into the university laboratory where she was working on her data. Flying into Nigeria late at night, she found herself being "assisted" through customs by a couple of men who were very curious about the money and jewelry she was carrying; unable to shake them off outside the airport as she searched for a taxi, she finally approached a soldier with a submachine gun. Nigeria was split between three warring tribal groups; it was a gamble of two chances in three, she felt, that the soldier was of a different tribe than the men who were escorting her into the dark. The gamble paid off; she got free, with the soldier's aid, and drove off into the curfew of nighttime Lagos to follow up her latest research project. In her studies of women in the developing economies, Blumberg has found herself traveling inconspicuously in a crowded bus to avoid demonstrations, sometimes in government vehicles or even armored cars, sometimes with nervous drivers making their way through a road known for ambushes. The discovery of society, for Rae Blumberg, is both a dedication and an adventure. Blumberg's approach to the theory of gender stratification can be illustrated by her examination of the Israeli kibbutz, and her answer to the puzzle: Why do these experiments in social equality, which minimize the organization of the family and bring children up communally, nevertheless end up with men dominating the important positions? The answer, Blumberg decided, is a two-step chain. Men and women are supposed to share the work of the kibbutz equally, but in fact men do the main work, such as driving the tractors in the fields; women tend to be in charge of the children's nursery and the laundry. And since the economic prosperity of the kibbutz depends on its agricultural output, men's work in this sphere gives</p>
<p class="calibre1">them greater prestige and greater power in the community. The most important sector economically is the one that determines gender power. So now for the second step in the chain: How did women become concentrated in the laundry and men in the fields? The answer is of general significance for the way societies have been organized at different times in history. Where work is compatible with the activities of women in bearing and caring for small children, that work tends to be done by women. Work which would take women away from the home, whether driving tractors in the fields or hunting for game in early tribal societies, tends to be monopolized by men. Let us consider now the general theory to which Blumberg contributed, along with Chafetz, Huber, and others. First, let us consider the overall pattern of world history. Since the approach of this general theory is economic, we need to begin with the differences in the economic base. In hunting-and- gathering societies, gender inequality was usually fairly low. (Blumberg and Chafetz here are following the classification of social types developed by Lenski, which was mentioned above.) In horticultural societies, the picture is more mixed. These societies are supported by growing crops in small gardens. Typically there is a complicated kinship system, sometimes organized around women's lineages and/or women's place of residence, sometimes organized around male lineage and residence. In some of these societies women are fairly prominent in power and ideology; some are male-dominated; some are split into sharply separate spheres, which amounts to an open "war of the sexes." Here we may find adult men living in separate houses for warriors, maintaining taboos against the women, who live in their own huts with the children and see the men mainly for sexual contact. Agrarian societies are the civilizations of ancient and medieval history that we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Here the economy has expanded to large-scale farming, using plows, animals, and sometimes massive irrigation systems. There is much more economic surplus than before, and this goes into building a class system dominated by the aristocracy. Women now depend upon the class position of the men in their families, and have little autonomous power. Upper-class women are often tightly controlled. Along with this went a cult of virginity; women were regarded primarily as sexual objects who were to be guarded at all costs. For men, there was the other side of a dual standard: Men's sexual exploits were often admired, just as women's were restricted. Women of the working class were the most exploited group in these societies; not only did they perform most of the menial work but they were also targets for the sexual machismo of upper-class men. When we come to industrial societies, as they developed from the 1700s in Europe, we find that gender inequality drops somewhat from the extremes of agrarian societies. But change comes slowly and goes through two large phases. In the earlier phase of industrial societies, gender relations change in all social classes. Upper-class women are not so restricted; working-class women, on the other hand, begin to get some protections from exploitation</p>
<p class="calibre1">at work and sexually. The ideal woman in this phase comes to be regarded as the middle-class housewife and mother; she is considered to be supreme in her own sphere, but it was also considered desirable to protect her by separation from the male sphere of work. Finally there is the phase when a women's movement mobilizes against this separation of spheres. There is a trend toward integration and equality in the traditional male realms of work and politics and also of bringing men into the traditional female realms of housework and child rearing. In the late twentieth century, these trends obviously are still a long way from finished. How can these differences across human history be explained? The general theory of gender stratification focuses on the intersection of several causes: (1) women's economic position; (2) women's reproductive position; and (3) male and female politics. With regard to economic position, both Blumberg and Chafetz point out that the historical differences correlate with the kind of work that women do. In hunting-and-gathering systems, most of the food production comes from gathering rather than hunting; and since women do most of the gathering, this gives them a key economic base and gives them a fair degree of social power and prestige. In horticultural systems, women again contribute the most production, since it is typically women who do the gardening. But now we arrive at a complication. It is not simply who does the work that determines stratification, but who controls the property. In some horticultural tribes, for instance, there is a male supremacist complex; the women do the work but the men appropriate it because they are organized into military groups which dominate the macrostructure of society. This kind of economic analysis, we can see, is leading toward another kind of factor which determines the property system. In agrarian societies, women's social position sinks to the lowest scale in world history. This is related to the fact that women now tend to have the lowest input into economic productivity. The center of the economy is in heavy agriculture, or in herding animals, or again sometimes in seafaring and in long-distance trade; all of these activities are monopolized by men, while women work as servants or perform the smaller tasks around the farm. And even where a woman works, men tend to control her property as their own. Here we have a strong negative on both dimensions: women's economic power and women's social status and power are both low. Finally, industrial societies. Here we have evidence that as women get more income under their own control, their power position increases both inside the home and in the larger society. Sometimes this happens through inheritance, but most often through women's own careers; a woman's power now tends to depend upon how much she makes in comparison to her husband or to other men around her. These comparisons lead us to two further questions: Why do women have the kinds of work they do in these different societies and why are women only sometimes able to control their own property, while at other</p>
<p class="calibre1">times the fruits of their labor are taken over by males? The first question leads us to consider the reproductive sphere; the second to consider politics. With regard to the reproductive sphere, Blumberg, Chafetz, and other theorists have pointed to the extent to which work is compatible with women's pregnancies, nursing, and child rearing. This leads to a further issue. Why is it that women sometimes are heavily concentrated in having babies and spend much of their lives caring for children? Yet in other times, women have far fewer children, or spread the child-care responsibility around so that some of the women at least are free to do other things. Joan Huber and other contributors have put together a theory to answer this point. When a society has a high death rate or a big demand for children for other reasons, women are especially valued as mothers. Women tend to be pregnant through much of their adult lives; when they are not pregnant they are breast-feeding small children. There is a vicious circle: Societies with a high death rate have poor health and medical conditions, making childbirths very dangerous, so many women die in childbirth. Add to this the fact that many children die before they grow up, and we see a vicious circle which feeds the death rate and keeps up the demand for still more childbirths. And since women are continuously bound up in the reproductive sphere, they have little opportunity to get the kinds of economic productivity which would give them a source of social power. How can they escape this vicious cycle? Several conditions have sometimes intervened. When medical conditions improved or the environment was favorable, the death rate was lowered, taking some of the pressure off to have many children. In addition, through technologies of birth control, especially the invention of effective contraceptives in the early twentieth century, the birth rate could be dropped lower still. And finally the invention of the sanitary baby bottle around 1910 made it possible, at least in principle, for a mother not to be constantly in close proximity to her small children in order for them to be fed. As the result of all these factors, birth rates have generally fallen in the twentieth century, and so have the proportion of their lives that women spend in child rearing. At the same time, women's economic opportunities have gradually widened. We still need to examine one more factor in explaining gender stratification. Both of the previous factors—economic position and the reproductive sphere—are sometimes overriden by a third factor. Women sometimes do much of the work but reap few of the rewards because men end up appropriating the property. And although women in the twentieth century are no longer forced by social conditions to spend their lives breeding children, it still took most of the century for a change in their career patterns to come about. The third factor that intervenes is the political system, operating at the larger, macro level. Blumberg, Chafetz, and other gender theorists recognize how large-scale politics can keep women from gaining the economic positions they might otherwise have. In some colonial societies in Africa,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for instance, European rulers bypassed the women's networks which were traditionally in control of local economic life and appointed male chiefs. In the early twentieth century, labor unions often pushed for laws which restricted women from certain types of factory work; this was supposed to protect women from heavy working conditions, but it also guaranteed jobs for men. How then do we account for male advantage in controlling politics? This part of the theory of gender is not as well developed in those theories that start from an economic or reproductive viewpoint. One line of theory, based on some ideas of Max Weber and developed by Randall Collins, points out that much depends on how the state is organized militarily. Men have usually monopolized weapons and fighting; and when the state consisted primarily of bands of warriors or of aristocratic families living in armed castles, this military monopoly translated into a male control of the state. As long as men controlled the state, all the state ideologies were male oriented too; and whenever the state intervened in private life, it did so to back up the property and sexual advantages of males. According to this political theory of gender, the crucial turning point came when the modern bureaucratic state emerged. The state is separated from the aristocratic families which used to dominate its policies; the way is opened to reform movements and eventually to peaceful control by voting rather than by the wars and alliances of the aristocrats. This provided an opening for women to negate traditional male control at the macro level; it remained only potential, though, until women were actually mobilized to throw their weight into politics. Now we encounter a crucial problem for all three of our lines of theory: economic, reproductive, and political. By the time industrial societies are fairly advanced, the conditions in all three of these theories have swung toward those favoring relative equality for women. Why, then, have the changes taken so long to come? The bureaucratic state under civilian control already existed in the 1800s; a low death rate, baby bottles, and birth control existed by around 1910; jobs in the industrial society moved predominantly toward the white-collar sector where women's labor was easily available. Why then was there a 60-year or so lag before women really got mobilized to break down the barriers of gender segregation? Janet Chafetz suggests a theory for this lag. Male control of the macro- level structures of society translates into ideological beliefs of the appropriate way to behave in micro-level situations. When men control the higher occupational positions, women have few role models like themselves in these kinds of positions. Their self-images, rather, are of women they see most frequently: mothers, homemakers, secretaries, and nurses; or in the mass media, actresses who specialize in sex appeal. The ideological definitions of male and female activities thus reinforce the way jobs are actually divided up; it is another vicious circle. How can women break through this circle? Chafetz points out that if the circle can be reversed, so that there are many women in professional and managerial careers, it will provide a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">definition of male and female and mobilize even more women to seek these kinds of careers. And since economic position flows into power position in the home, the whole social structure will move in an egalitarian direction. What seems to break through this ideological stumbling block is primarily in the realm of politics. Political movements that bring women into the public eye stir up widespread feelings that go far beyond the people who take part in the movements. This is why feminist movements have been mobilized during the periods when women's career ambitions suddenly rise. It happened to a lesser degree around the turn of the twentieth century, when the feminist movement mobilized for suffrage. And it happened again in the 1970s and 1980s, with the second wave of the women's movement. Politics consists of conflicts, and it is not surprising that the period of women's mobilization in the 1970s gave rise to tremendous controversy. One aspect was the appearance of backlash movements, the mobilization of conservative women as well as men against the new legal and social trends. Thus movements arose which stressed the preeminent value of women as mothers and homemakers and opposed women's careers outside the home. Nevertheless, as Chafetz and her collaborators point out, these backlash movements are usually not as strong as the movement for gender change. The size of the backlash movement depends on the size of the movement it is mobilizing against, which means that the conditions that mobilize women into demanding better economic payoffs are already present. An antifeminist movement is always too late to bring the structure back to its old condition, because those changes in the structure in the first place (the changes we listed earlier in this theoretical account) were already shifting the balance of power. The political movement of women is like a spring which has been loaded by underlying structural changes; the ideological conditions we just outlined keep the spring down, but once a mobilization starts, it is like unleashing the spring. All of these varieties of gender stratification theory are optimistic about the long run. The conditions which favor gender equality have been shifting for a century toward the women's side. The question is, how long will it take? Chafetz offers the most explicit projection. If favorable economic trends continue, she suggests, the demand for women's labor will continue to grow; this should be especially strong as the white-collar sector comes to dominate the occupational structure. When the current cohort of baby boomers retires around 2010-2020, the next cohort with its mobilized female labor force should be a gender-egalitarian one. Chafetz also casts a wary eye on a pessimistic projection. When there have been economic downturns in the past, men usually pushed women back out of the labor force; short-term economic gains that women had won were subsequently lost. Under this scenario, the big danger is another economic catastrophe, like the Great Depression of the 1930s. If that happens— and the rickety financial structure of the world economy in the 1990s is none too reassuring on this score—women may again be pushed back out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the labor force, and male domination in all spheres will return. Perhaps both of these scenarios omit some crucial pieces that we have not foreseen. Political factors have been the joker in the deck at various times in the past, and we should not expect economic and reproductive trends alone to totally determine the future either. We can expect the politics of gender to be involved in more battles: over new aspects of job legislation, child care, reproductive rights and restrictions, and family laws. Sociological understanding of the dynamics of gender stratification has been maturing; doubtless we will have more to learn about it in the future. WOMEN AND THE FUTURE OF SOCIOLOGY We could go on, if there were more space, to discuss the theories and discoveries of women in a wide range of sociology. Today, talking about the work of women sociologists is tantamount to talking about the field as a whole. In the macrosociology of the world system, for example, one would have to consider Janet Abu-Lughod, who shows us that the capitalist world system which arose in the sixteenth century out of a European core was not the first world system. Abu-Lughod takes us back to a previous world system in the thirteenth century, the "High Middle Ages," when Europe was just one end of an economic chain that stretched all the way to China, and in which India and above all the Islamic world were at the center. Instead of "the rise of the West," Abu-Lughod tells us, our real problem in explaining modern history is to account for "the fall of the East." Women are prominent in microsociology as well. In any survey of the field one would have to deal with Karen Cook, a leader in exchange theory and social networks. In the sociology of science, Karin Knorr-Cetina formulated a radical "social constructionist" position to show how what is considered to be knowledge is created in the activities of scientists in the face-to- face action in their laboratories. In the sociology of organizations, a leading figure is Rosabeth Moss Kanter, with her insightful portrait of the way careers—of both men and women—are made in the internal politics of the big corporation. The methodological approaches pioneered by women range from hard to soft; Nancy Tuma is one of the creators of the statistical method of "event history analysis"; Arlie Hochschild developed an interpretive theory of emotions stressing the fluid and cognitive processes by which people define their feelings through "emotion work." Dorothy Smith developed her "standpoint theory," which argues that any group, men or women, majority or minority, produces a theory which expresses the standpoint of that particular group. Smith thus interprets feminist theory as a standpoint which opposes male viewpoints with a distinctive feminist viewpoint. It has been argued that men's methods in sociology are hard and impersonal; that women's methods avoid mathematics, statistics, and objectivity, and instead concentrate on qualitative data and subjective understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Men, it is said, go for abstractions and generalities; women go for the unique and particular. To be honest, the authors of this book can hardly endorse a position which calls for cutting sociology into two uncommunicat- ing halves. On this issue, we are old-fashioned liberals: we believe in equality, participation, and cooperation. We do not wish to retire into a men's zone of sociology, while the women retire into their separate zone. As we have examined the discovery of society throughout this book, we have seen that many kinds of methods were used. Many standpoints were the bases from which sociological explorations have been launched; nevertheless they all come together into an ongoing body of knowledge that is called sociology. The men who were first in the kinds of social settings in which sociology could be done analyzed society from both objective and subjective viewpoints. Marx had both economics and dialectics; Weber focused both on bureaucracy and on verstehen. Thinkers like Mead, Goffman, and Garfinkel showed the objective elements in the subjective and the subjective side of objective structures. Since the 1960s, when women began to fill the forefront of the discipline, women sociologists have done important work in virtually every kind of sociology. As women, they often bring distinctive standpoints from their social backgrounds and sensitivities. Yet another crucial part of their social surroundings as sociologists is that which they share with male sociologists: the intellectual networks in which creativity always operates and the passing along of cultural capital from the generations of the past. Future historians of sociology will see our lifetimes as a period in which several new streams flow together into the older river. Sociology is a community, stretching over the generations, comprising now both men and women, engaged in the ongoing discovery of society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bibliographical Suggestions There is no satisfactory overview of the whole development of sociology, but the scope of its history can be gathered from Howard Becker and Harry Elmer Barnes, Social Thought from Lore to Science, 3 vols. (New York: Dover, 1961), which tells about most of the main figures plus an extraordinary number of minor ones, ranging from ancient Greece to modern Afghanistan. At the other extreme there are books such as Raymond Aron, Main Currents in Sociological Thought (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1968), and Robert Nisbet, The Sociological Tradition (New York: Basic Books, 1966), which treat just a few of the classical European thinkers. Much information on the lives and sociopolitical surroundings of the great sociologists is found in Lewis Coser, Masters of Sociological Thought (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1971). We are also beginning to apply the sociology of science to sociology's history in a serious way. One of the best of such efforts is Nicholas Mullins, Theories and Theory Groups in Contemporary American Sociology (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1973). Recent developments are analyzed in Randall Collins, Sociology Since Mid-Century (New York: Academic Press, 1981). For neighboring disciplines, the reader could consult Joseph Schumpeter's masterful History of Economic Analysis (New York: Oxford University Press, 1954), and Marvin Harris, The Rise of Anthropological Theory (New York: Crowell, 1968). Chapter One The Prophets of Paris: Saint-Simon and Comte The Enlightenment background of the early French sociologists is brought wonderfully alive by the Frenchman Paul Hazard in European Thought in the Eighteenth Century (New York: Meridian, 1963) and is given a thorough German treatment by Ernst Cassirer in The Philosophy of the Enlightenment (Boston: Beacon Press, 1955). The lives of Saint-Simon, Comte, Fourier, and others are found in Frank Manuel, The Prophets of Paris (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1963). A good selection of Saint-Simon's work in paperback is Henri de Saint-Simon, Social Organization and Other Writings, Felix Markham (ed.) (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1964), and of Comte's work, Auguste Comte: Sire of Sociology, George Simpson (ed.) (New York: Crowell, 1969). Comte's lengthy System of Positive Philosophy is heavy going. Chapter Two Sociology in the Underground: Karl Marx Marx is still eminently readable, although this is least true of his masterpiece, Capital (New York: Kerr, 1906). A good selection of his and Engels' writings is in Lewis S. Feuer, Marx and Engels: Basic Writings on Politics and 306</p>
<p class="calibre1">Philosophy (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1959). The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (New York: International, 1963) is a fine example of Marx as a historian of contemporary events. The theory of gender stratification is given in Friedrich Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (New York: International Publishers, 1972). Marx's uncompleted system is sketched in his unpublished manuscript, Grundrisse (New York: Random House, 1973). Erich Fromm's Marx's Concept of Man (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1961) gives Marx's early humanist philosophy; Fromm's introduction is a useful guide to some rather difficult writing. Herbert Marcuse, Reason and Revolution (New York: Humanities Press, 1954), is the classic exposition of Hegel's system and its transformation into Marx's; Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964) contains his revival of these themes, now popular with factions of the new left. The history of Marxism is most absorbingly told in Edmund Wilson, To the Finland Station (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1953), beginning with Marx's eighteenth-century predecessors and continuing up to Lenin in 1917; Isaac Deutscher, Trotsky, 3 vols. (New York: Vintage, 1965), continues the story through the tragedy of Russia in the 1920s and 1930s. George Lichtheim, Marxism (New York: Praeger, 1965), gives a scholarly analysis of the Marxian system from the 1830s up to the present. The major modern biography of Marx is David McLennan, Karl Marx, His Life and Thought (London: Macmillan, 1973). Marx's economics is updated for current issues in Paul A. Baran and Paul A. Sweezy, Monopoly Capital (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1966), Andrew Gunder Frank, Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1967), Arghiri Emmanuel, Unequal Exchange (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1972), and James O'Connor, The Fiscal Crisis of the State (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1973). Other developments in Marxist thought include Jurgen Habermas, Legitimation Crisis (Boston: Beacon Press, 1975) and Louis Althusser, For Marx (New York: Pantheon, 1969). The continuing power of a sophisticated and nondogmatic Marxian sociology is illustrated by Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1966), Immanuel Wallerstein, The Modern World System (New York: Academic Press, Vol. 1, 1974; Vol. 2, 1980; Vol. 3, 1989), Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, Schooling in Capitalist America (New York: Basic Books, 1975), Perry Anderson, Lineages of the Absolutist State (London: New Left Books, 1974), and Theda Skocpol, States and Social Revolutions (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979). Marxian and feminist theories are compared in Natalie J. Sokolov, Between Money and Love: The Dialectics of Women's Home and Market Work (New York: Praeger, 1980). Chapter Three The Last Gentleman: Alexis de Tocqueville Tocqueville's Democracy in America, 2 vols. (New York: Knopf, 1945), is read everywhere; his Old Regime and the French Revolution (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1955) is even more worthwhile—short, concise, delightful in idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">and expression. Tocqueville tells much of his own life story in his Recollections (New York: Columbia University Press, 1949). Tocqueville's work, as well as that of Saint-Simon, Comte, Durkheim, Sorel, and many others in this book, can hardly be understood apart from the history of France; Alfred Cobban, A History of Modern France (London: Penguin, 1957), outlines the story extremely well. George Pierson, Tocqueville and Beaumont in America (New York: Oxford University Press, 1938), describes what Tocqueville saw and did not see on his visit to America. Tocqueville's ideas about mass society have been given modern currency by J. L. Talmon, The Rise of Totalitarian Democracy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952), and Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1954). Chapter Four Nietzsche's Madness Nietzsche's collected works are published in many editions. The Portable Nietzsche, edited by Walter Kaufmann (New York: Viking Press, 1954), is a good paperback reader, including all of Thus Spake Zarathustra, The Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist, as well as selections from other works. The Birth of Tragedy and The Genealogy of Morals are published together in a Doubleday paperback (Garden City, N.Y.: 1956). Important secondary sources on Nietzsche include Walter Kaufmann, Nietzsche (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1950), Erich Podach, The Madness of Nietzsche (London: Routledge, 1931), and numerous works in French and German. Rudolph Binion, Frau Lou: Nietzsche's Wayward Disciple (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1968), tells of the woman who was a friend of both Nietzsche and Freud. Perhaps the most revealing picture of Nietzsche is in Peter Fuss and Henry Shapiro (eds.), Nietzsche: A Self-Portrait from His Letters (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971). Chapter Five Do-Gooders, Evolutionists, and Racists Of the Anglo-American tradition, the works most worth reading today are William Graham Sumner, Folkways (New York: Mentor, 1961), and Herbert Spencer, Principles of Sociology (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1884), Vol. 1. Spencer's work must be sampled selectively, as it is padded out to enormous length by all sorts of curious examples—but one must remember that he was being paid to serialize his work for a magazine monthly. The utilitarian tradition is described in Elie Halevy, The Growth of Philosophical Radicalism (Boston: Beacon Press, 1955). About all that anyone would ever want to know about early American sociology is found in L. L. and Jessie Bernard, Origins of American Sociology (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1965), and Roscoe C. and Gisela J. Hinkle, The Development of Modern Sociology (New York: Random House, 1954). Herman and Julia Schwendinger, Sociologists of the Chair (New York: Basic Books, 1974), put this development in its political context. Richard Hofstadter's The Age of Reform (New York:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vintage, 1955) and his Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (New York: Vintage, 1966) give the proper historical setting. The vogue of biological and racial explanations is hard to grasp from most modern histories, which leave this out because of their own bias as to what is important (and a good image) for the field. An exception is Pitirim Sorokin's Contemporary Sociological Theories (New York: Harper, 1928), which gives the full flavor of the pre-World War I intellectual milieu. The basic text for Edward O. Wilson is Sociobiology: The Abridged Edition (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1980), which is divided into sections on Social Evolution, Social Mechanisms, and The Social Species. It emerged from the sourcebook in research, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). On Human Nature (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1978) is a Pulitzer Prize winner which deals with the perspective on the challenge of human survival and the question of free will versus genetic determinism. A primary sourcebook of John C. Lilly is Lilly on Dolphins: Humans of the Sea (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press, 1975), a revised edition of two earlier works: Man and Dolphin (New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1961) and The Mind of the Dolphin (New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1967). Lilly's personal, social, and intellectual growth is described in The Scientist: A Novel Autobiography (New York: Bantam Books, 1981). Chapter Six Dreyfus's Empire: Emile Durkheim and Georges Sorel Durkheim's major works are The Division of Labor in Society (New York: Free Press, 1964), Suicide (New York: Free Press, 1966), The Roles of the Sociological Method (New York: Free Press, 1938), Socialism (New York: Collier, 1962), Professional Ethics and Civic Morals (New York: Free Press, 1958), and The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (New York: Collier, 1961). They are all well worth reading. Miscellaneous papers on and by Durkheim are in Kurt H. Wolff (ed.), Emile Durkheim: Essays on Sociology and Philosophy (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965). Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937), Vol. 1, and Edward A. Tiryakian, Sociologism and Existentialism (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1962), give critical assessments. Major works in the French Durkheimian tradition are Marcel Mauss, The Gift (New York: Norton, 1967), and the writings of Claude Levi-Strauss, to which the best introduction is his Structural Anthropology (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1967). Important empirical developments of Durkheim's theories include Guy Swanson, The Birth of the Gods (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1962); Kai Erikson, Wayward Puritans (New York: Wiley, 1966); Mary Douglas, Natural Symbols (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1970); and the materials summarized in Randall Collins, Conflict Sociology (New York: Academic Press, 1975), chapters 2 through 4 and 7. The definitive intellectual biography of Durkheim is Steven Lukes, Emile Durkheim, His Life and Work (New York: Allen Lane,</p>
<p class="calibre1">1973). A brilliant sociology of science analysis of Durkheim's milieu is given in Terry N. Clark, Prophets and Patrons: The French University and the Emergence of the Social Sciences (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973). Georges Sorel, in addition to Reflections on Violence (New York: Collier, 1961), wrote The Illusions of Progress (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969). A good collection of his works is in John L. Stanley (ed.), From Georges Sorel: Essays in Socialism and Philosophy (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976). Sorel's intellectual biography is given in James H. Meisel, The Genesis of Georges Sorel (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Wahr Publishing, 1951). Sorel, Durkheim, and others of the fin de siecle generation in Europe are treated in H. Stuart Hughes, Consciousness and Society (New York: Vintage, 1961). Chapter Seven Max Weber: The Disenchantment of the World Max Weber's works are voluminous and still of great value. His great (and uncompleted) lifework, the comparative studies of the world religions, is found in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (New. York: Scribners, 1958), The Religion of China (New York: Free Press, 1951), The Religion of India (New York: Free Press, 1958), and Ancient Judaism (New York: Free Press, 1952). A short summary, based on his lectures, is in General Economic History (New York: Free Press, 1950). Weber's main generalizing efforts are found in Economy and Society, 3 vols. (New York: Bedminster Press, 1968); parts of this are in paperback as The Theory of Social and Economic Organization (New York: Free Press, 1964), The Sociology of Religion (Boston: Beacon Press, 1963), The City (New York: Free Press, 1968), Max Weber on Law in Economy and Society (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1954), and From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1946). The last also contains Weber's famous lectures "Science as a Vocation" and "Politics as a Vocation." Other writings are collected in The Methodology of the Social Sciences (New York: Free Press, 1959). Finally, Weber's Rational and Social Foundations of Music (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Press, 1958) is a tour de force in the sociology of cultural history. The major commentary on Weber is Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1962); see also Talcott Parsons, The Structure of Social Action (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937), Vol. 2; Randall Collins, "Weber's Last Theory of Capitalism: A Systematization," American Sociological Review 45 (1980); and Randall Collins, Max Weber: A Skeleton Key (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1986). Some applications of Weber's analysis from very different points of view are found in Reinhard Bendix, Kings or People (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978), Talcott Parsons, Societies: Comparative and Evolutionary Perspectives (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1966), Bryan S. Turner, For Weber (London: Routledge, 1981), and Randall Collins, Weberian Sociological Theory (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986). No truly satisfactory personal biography of Weber is yet available.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marianne Weber, Max Weber: A Biography (New York: Wiley, 1975), provides his wife's viewpoint. Arthur Mitzman, The Iron Cage (New York: Knopf, 1970), gives a speculative psychoanalytic interpretation that sees Weber's life as a persistent failure. Martin Green, The Von Richthofen Sisters (New York: Basic Books, 1974), fills in information on the liberated milieu of Weber's later life, when he became connected via his mistress to such people as D. H. Lawrence and the radical Freudian fringe. Chapter Eight Sigmund Freud: Conquistador of the Irrational An excellent anthology of Freud's classic essays is A. A. Brill, The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (New York: Modern Library, 1938), which includes selections from Psychopathology of Everyday Life, The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious, Totem and Taboo, and The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement. The Collected Papers, 5 vols. (London: Hogarth Press, 1953-1956), contains substantial and wide-ranging material for the serious student, while John Rickman, A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1957), is a top-notch sampler for beginners. The classic biography is Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (New York: Basic Books, 1961); however, Maryse Choisy, Sigmund Freud: A New Appraisal (New York: Philosophical Library, 1963), is the most intimate, in-depth psychological portrait of the founder. Freud's views on religion and culture are amplified in The Future of an Illusion (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1957) and Civilization and Its Discontents (New York: Norton, 1961). Outstanding secondary sources include Erich Fromm, Sigmund Freud's Mission (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959); Philip Reiff, Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (New York: Doubleday, 1961); Paul Roazen, Freud: Political and Social Thought (New York: Knopf, 1968); and David Bakan, Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition (New York: Van Nostrand, 1958). In Life Against Death (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1959), Norman O. Brown applies psychoanalysis to history in an illuminating manner. Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization (New York: Vintage, 1962) explores humankind's potentialities for regeneration in terms of freedom from repression. Hendrik M. Ruitenbeek (ed.), Psychoanalysis and Social Science (New York: Dutton, 1964), selects eleven key essays that probe the integration of the social sciences and psychoanalysis in America. Paul Robinson, The Freudian Left (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), sums up the contributions of Reich, Roheim, and Marcuse. Feminist treatments of Freud include Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of Sex (New York: Morrow, 1970), and Juliet Mitchell, Psychoanalysis and Feminism (New York: Pantheon, 1974). Nancy Chodorow's important revision of Freud is The Reproduction of Mothering (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978). Source material for Jung includes the following works: Modern Man in Search of a Soul (New York: Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, 1933) is a presentation of the contemporary crisis of humanity in psychohistorical, cultural,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and transpersonal, or spiritual terms; Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1961) is a fascinating scientific autobiography; Man and His Symbols (London: Aldus Books Limited, 1964) is a good beginner's textbook for students of Jung. Refer to his Collected Works (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1953-1967) for in-depth research. Excellent secondary sources with social orientation are by I. Progoff, Jung's Psychology and Its Social Meaning (New York: Evergreen Books, 1955); E. Neumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1954); M. Serrano, C. G. Jung and Hermann Hesse: A Record of Two Friendships (London: Routledge, 1966); E. Whitmont, The Symbolic Quest (New York: Putnam, 1969); and R. Wilhelm and C. G. Jung, The Secret of the Golden Flower (London: Routledge, 1962). Chapter Nine The Discovery of the Invisible World: Simmel, Cooley, and Mead Simmel's works are available in Kurt. H. Wolff (ed.), The Sociology of Georg Simmel (New York: Free Press, 1950), and Conflict and the Web of Group- Affiliations (New York: Free Press, 1955). Essays by and about Simmel are in Kurt H. Wolff (ed.), Essays on Sociology, Philosophy, and Aesthetics by Georg Simmel et al. (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), and Lewis A. Coser, Georg Simmel (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965). On Simmel, see Nicholas J. Spykman, The Social Theory of Georg Simmel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1925), and Lewis A. Coser, The Functions of Social Conflict (New York: Free Press, 1956). The major works of Charles H. Cooley are Human Nature and the Social Order (New York: Schocken, 1964), Social Organization: A Study of the Larger Mind (New York: Schocken, 1962), and Social Process (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Press, 1966). He lays down his optimistic, beginning-of-the-century sociology in this trilogy. Cooley displays his breadth and depth of interest in Sociological Theory and Social Research (New York: Kelley, 1969), which contains selected early papers. The best secondary source is Albert J. Reiss (ed.), Cooley and Sociological Analysis (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1968), which is a collection of essays on Cooley's significance by contemporary theorists. George H. Mead's primary contribution to social psychology is found in Mind, Self, and Society, Charles W. Morris (ed.) (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934). The Philosophy of the Act (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1938) contains an analysis of the stages of the act, which is relevant to Mead's theory; The Philosophy of the Present (La Salle, 111.: Open Court, 1959) includes important material on the self in relation to time; and Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1936) presents a classic chapter on the problem of society, in addition to valuable work on the philosophic foundations of twentieth-century scientific sociology. Worthwhile secondary sources are Jerome G. Manis and Bernard N. Meltzer, Symbolic Interaction: A Reader in Social Psychology (Boston: Allyn &amp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bacon, 1967), and Herbert Blumer, Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1969). The latter is an exposition of symbolic interactionism by Mead's foremost sociological pupil. A different slant on contemporary schools is given in Sheldon Stryker, Symbolic Interactionism: A Social Structural Version (Menlo Park, Calif.: Cummings, 1980). John Dewey's Human Nature and Conduct (New York: Modern Library, 1957) is his treatise on social psychology, and William James, Psychology: Briefer Course (New York: Collier, 1962), contains valuable material for understanding the development of self theory. See also John J. McDermott (ed.), The Writing of William James (New York: Random House, 1967), and Paul E. Pfeutze's original work, Self, Society, Existence: Human Nature and Dialogue in the Thought of George Herbert Mead and Martin Buber (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1961). The entire movement is reassessed by J. D. Lewis and R. Smith, American Sociology and Pragmatism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). The best treatment of Mead as philosopher is David L. Miller, George Herbert Mead: Self, Language and the World (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1973). Chapter Ten The Discovery of the Ordinary World: Thomas, Park, and the Chicago School The history of the Chicago school is given in Robert E. L. Faris, Chicago Sociology (San Francisco: Chandler, 1967). The studies of Thomas and Znaniecki, Park, and their followers are described in John Madge, The Rise of Scientific Sociology (New York: Free Press, 1962). Representative writings may be sampled in Morris Janowitz (ed.), W. I. Thomas on Social Organization and Social Personality (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), Ralph H. Turner (ed.), Robert E. Park on Social Control and Collective Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), Otis Dudley Duncan (ed.), William F. Ogburn on Culture and Social Change (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964), and Albert J. Reiss, Jr. (ed.), Louis Wirth on Cities and Social Life (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966). Also of interest is the famous textbook by Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess, Introduction to the Science of Sociology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921). Primary source material on W. E. Burghardt Du Bois includes the following: The Autobiography of W.E.B. Du Bois: A Soliloquy on Viewing My Life from the Last Decade of Its First Century (New York: International Publishers, 1988) includes a comprehensive bibliography plus a calendar of his public life. The Souls of Black Folk (New York: Signet, 1982) is a collection of essays, originally published in 1903, Against Racism: Unpublished Essays, Papers, Addresses, 1887-1961, edited by Herbert Aptheker (Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1985), provides new material. Du Bois' oratory is collected in W.E.B. Du Bois Speaks: Speeches and Addresses 1890-1919, 1920-1963 edited by Philip S. Foner (New York: Pathfinder, 1988). Du Bois writes of the richness of African civilization and culture in The Negro (New</p>
<p class="calibre1">York: Kraus-Thomson, 1988) with a new introduction by Herbert Aptheker. John Brown (New York: International Publishers, 1987) is the historical biography of the abolitionist martyr. Many of Du Bois' writings for The Crisis are included in An ABC of Color (New York: International Publishers, 1969). The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study (New York: Schocken Books, 1967) is Du Bois' most enduring empirical work, originally published in 1899. Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880 (Cleveland: Meridian, 1962) is his historical defense of Reconstruction governments with an economic interpretation of northern discrimination. The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870 (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1970) is still a classic in the field. Key secondary sources include Elliot Rudwick, W.E.B. Du Bois: Voice of the Black Protest Movement (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1982); Rayford W. Logan (ed.), W.E.B. Du Bois: A Profile (New York: Hill and Wang, 1971); Arnold Rampersad, The Art and Imagination of W.E.B. Du Bois (New York: Schocken Books, 1990); and Leslie Alexander Lacy, The Life of W.E.B. Du Bois: Cheer the Lonesome Traveler (New York: Dial Press, 1970). On E. Franklin Frazier see the chapter by G. Franklin Edwards in Robert K. Merton and Matilda White Riley, Sociological Traditions from Generation to Generation (Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1980). Chapter Eleven The Construction of the Social System: Pareto and Parsons Pareto's The Mind and Society, 5 vols. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1935), is best approached through the selections in Joseph Lopreato (ed.), Vilfredo Pareto (New York: Crowell, 1955). The most notable recent interpretation of Pareto is Charles Powers and Robert Hanneman, "Pareto's Equilibrium Theory: A Formal Model and Simulation," in Randall Collins (ed.), Sociological Theory 1983 (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1983). Talcott Parsons' first major work, The Structure of Social Action (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937), contains an important interpretation of Pareto as well as of Alfred Marshall, Durkheim, and Weber. Parsons' other works include The Social System (New York: Free Press, 1951), Essays in Sociological Theory (New York: Free Press, 1954), Toward a General Theory of Action (with Edward Shils) (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1951), Economy and Society (with Neil J. Smelser) (New York: Free Press, 1956), Societies: Comparative and Evolutionary Perspectives (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice- Hall, 1966), and the introductory essays in Theories of Society (edited with Edward Shils, Jesse R. Pitts, and Kaspar Naegele) (New York: Free Press, 1961). Commentaries are found in Max Black (ed.), The Social Theories of Talcott Parsons (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1961), and Alvin W. Gouldner, The Coming Crisis in Western Sociology (New York: Basic Books, 1970). Other varieties of functionalism are presented in Kingsley Davis, Human Society (New York: Macmillan, 1949), and Robert K. Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (New York: Free Press, 1968), and are debated in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the papers collected in N. J. Demerath III and Richard A. Peterson (eds.), System, Change, and Conflict (New York: Free Press, 1967). Representative works of modern functionalists include Neil J. Smelser, Theory of Collective Behavior (New York: Free Press, 1963); S. N. Eisenstadt, The Political Systems of Empires (New York: Free Press, 1963); and Robert N. Bellah, Tokugawa Religion (New York: Free Press, 1957). Parsons' evolutionism has been extended by recent German sociologists: Wolfgang Schlachter, The Rise of Western Rationalism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981); also Niklas Luhman, Trust—Power (London: Wiley, 1979). Parsons' works have been reappraised in the four-volume work of Jeffrey Alexander, Theoretical Logic in Sociology (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981-1983). Chapter Twelve Hitler's Shadow: Michels, Mannheim, and Mills Robert Michels' main work is Political Parties (New York: Collier, 1962); also available in English is his Introductory Lectures on Political Sociology (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1966). Karl Mannheim's translated works include Ideology and Utopia (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936), Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1940), Diagnosis of Our Time (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1943), Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge (New York: Oxford University Press, 1952), and Freedom, Power, and Democratic Planning (New York: Oxford University Press, 1950). C. Wright Mills wrote The New Men of Power (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1948), The Puerto Rican Journey (New York: Oxford University Press, 1950), White Collar (New York: Oxford University Press, 1951), Character and Social Structure (with Hans Gerth) (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1953), The Power Elite (New York: Oxford University Press, 1956), The Causes of World War Three (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1958), and The Sociological Imagination (New York: Oxford University Press, 1959). His collected papers are edited by Irving Louis Horowitz under the title Power, Politics, and People (New York: Oxford University Press, 1963). A continuation of the spirit of both Mannheim and Mills is found in Alvin W. Gouldner, The Dialectic of Ideology and Technology (New York: Seabury Press, 1976). Chapter Thirteen Erving Goffman and the Theater of Social Encounters Erving Goffman's main works are The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1959), Asylums (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1961), Encounters (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1961), Behavior in Public Places (New York: Free Press, 1963), Interaction Ritual (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1967), Strategic Interaction (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1969), Frame Analysis (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974), Gender Advertisements (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979), and Forms of Talk (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981). A collection of commentaries is found in Jason Ditton (ed.), The View from Goffman (London: Macmillan, 1979). Harold Garfinkers work is presented</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Studies in Ethnomethodology (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1967). Important background for American ethnomethodology is Alfred Schutz, Collected Papers (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1962-1966). Schutz's work has also been developed in Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1967). Also important are Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (New York: Macmillan, 1953), and John Austin, How to Do Things with Words (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1962). Recent developments in ethnomethodology are introduced in Hugh Mehan and Houston Wood, The Reality of Ethnomethodology (New York: Wiley, 1975), and are given in advanced form in Aaron Cicourel, Cognitive Sociology (Baltimore, Md.: Penguin Books, 1973). The British version of ethnomethodology and Marxism is shown in Barry Sandywell, David Silverman, Maurice Roche, Paul Filmer, and Michael Phillipson, Problems of Reflexivity and Dialectics in Sociological Inquiry (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1975). Efforts to tie this modern mi- crosociology to traditional sociological concerns are in Karin Knorr-Cetina and Aaron Cicourel, Advances in Social Theory and Methodology: Toward an Integration of Micro- and Macro-Sociologies (Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981). Anthony Giddens draws upon Goffman and the ethnomethod- ologists in The Constitution of Society (Oxford: Polity Press, 1984). Chapter Fourteen Sociology in the Late Twentieth Century Primary source material of Michel Foucault includes the following: Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason (New York- Random House, 1973; French original, 1961), a study of madness from 1500 to 1800 and the birth of the asylum. The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception (New York: Random House, 1975; original, 1963) is a history of the emergence of clinical medicine. The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Random House, 1970) is a detailed historicolinguistic analysis of the emergence of the human sciences and the recent concept of "man." The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language (New York: Random House, 1972; original, 1969) is his main methodological work on history and the discursive regularities. I, Pierre Riviere, having slaughtered my mother, my sister, and my brother: A Case of Parricide in the 19th Century (New York: Random House, 1975) is Foucault's editorial version of the intersections of medicine and law in the case of a madman and a glimpse into the birth of the psychiatrization of law. Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (New York: Random House, 1979; original, 1975) is a classic in criminology and portrays the development of the prison system from the late seventeenth to the middle nineteenth centuries. In The History of Sexuality: Volume I: An Introduction (New York: Random House, 1980; original, 1976), Foucault explores our compulsion to analyze and discuss sex since the seventeenth century. He writes the introduction to a fascinating case study, Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth Century French Hermaphrodite (New York:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Random House, 1980). The Use of Pleasure: The History of Sexuality: Volume Two (New York: Random House, 1986) is a short treatise on ethics and erotics in ancient Greek society. Foucaulf s final work, The Care of the Self: The History of Sexuality: Volume Three (New York: Random House, 1986), represents the theoretical peak of his vocation as a social scientist as he explores sex, ethics, marriage, and a new erotics in the Golden Age of Rome. The best collection of original writings is Paul Rabinow's Foucault Reader: An Introduction to Foucault's Thought, with Major New Unpublished Material (New York: Random House, 1984). Another important work is Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews by Michel Foucault (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University, 1977), edited by Donald F. Bouchard. Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977 by Michel Foucault (New York: Random House, 1980) is Colin Gordon's key editorial guide. This Is Not a Pipe: With Illustrations and Letters by Rene Magritte (Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1983) is Foucault's artistic tribute to the surrealist painter. Recommended secondary source material includes the following: Alan Sheridan, Michel Foucault: The Will to Truth (London: Tavistock Publications, 1980), John Rajchman, Michel Foucault: The Freedom of Philosophy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), Edith Kurzweil, The Age of Structuralism: Levi-Strauss to Foucault (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980), Barry Smart, Michel Foucault (New York: Barry Smart/Ellis Horwood Limited, 1985), presents Foucault as one of the new key sociologists. Hubert L. Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow, Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, With an Afterword by Michel Foucault (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1982), is a sophisticated version of Foucault's writings, theories, and methodology. Mark Cousins and Athar Hussain, Michel Foucault (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1984), places Foucault in the context of theoretical traditions in the social sciences and provides the most extensive references and bibliography to material about the author. The major works of Pierre Bourdieu are Reproduction: In Education, Society, and Culture, written with Jean-Claude Passeron (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1977; French original, 1970), Outline of a Theory of Practice (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1977; French original, 1972), Distinction. A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1984; French original, 1979). Jurgen Habermas' principal works include Legitimation Crisis (Boston: Beacon Press, 1975), Communication and the Evolution of Society (Boston: Beacon Press, 1979), and The Theory of Communicative Action (Boston: Beacon Press, 1984). Randall Collins' principal works are Conflict Sociology: Toward an Explanatory Science (New York: Academic Press, 1975), The Credential Society: An Historical Sociology of Education and Stratification (New York: Academic Press, 1979), Sociology since Midcentury: Essays in Theory Cumulation (New York: Academic Press, 1981), which includes his essay "On the Micro Foundations of Macro-sociology," Weberian Sociological Theory (New York:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cambridge University Press, 1986), and Theoretical Sociology (San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1988). Some important works of recent historical sociology are listed above in the latter part of the bibliography for Chapter 2. Immanuel Wallerstein's volumes of The Modern World-System are cited there. To this can be added Charles Tilly's important works, The Vendee, A Sociological Analysis of the Counterrevolution of 1793 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1964) and From Mobilization to Revolution (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1978), Craig Calhoun, The Question of Class Struggle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), Orlando Patterson, Slavery and Social Death (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1982), and Michael Mann, The Sources of Social Power (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986). Chapter 15 The Impact of Women in Sociology in the Late Twentieth Century On the position of women in creative literature in earlier periods see Ivar Morris, The World of the Shining Prince. Court Life in Ancient Japan (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964); Sarah B. Pomeroy, Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity (New York: Schocken, 1975). On women in radical and reformist movements see Leszek Kolakowski, Main Currents of Marxism, Vol. 2, Chapter III: "Rosa Luxemburg and the Revolutionary Left" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978); Mary Jo Deegan, Jane Addams and the Men of the Chicago School, 1892-1918 (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1988). For the upheavals that set off the most recent wave of the women's movement, see Todd Gitlin, The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage (New York: Basic Books, 1987). The modern comparative analysis of revolutions begins with Barrington Moore, Jr., Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1966). Theda Skocpol's major work is States and Social Revolutions (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979). She reflects on the social conditions of her career in "An "Uppity Generation' and the Revitalization of Macroscopic Sociology: Reflections at Midcareer by a Woman from the 1960s," in Matilda White Riley (ed.), Sociological Lives (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1988). This volume also contains autobiographies by other distinguished women sociologists, including Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Alice S. Rossi. Other works by Skocpol include her edited volumes Bringing the State Back In (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985), and The Politics of Social Policy in the United States (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1988). The early round of feminist theorists from the late 1960s and early 1970s, with their predominantly Marxian and Freudian themes, includes Kate Millett, Sexual Politics (New York: Doubleday, 1970); Germaine Greer, The Female Eunuch (London: MacGibbon and Kee, 1970); Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of Sex (New York: William Morrow, 1970); and Juliet Mitchell, Psychoanalysis and Feminism (New York: Pantheon, 1974). The range of feminist sociology in the last two decades is described in Janet Saltzman</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chafetz, Feminist Sociology: An Overview of Contemporary Theories (Itasca, 111.: Peacock, 1988). Background for the comparative theory of social inequality comes from Gerhard E. Lenski, Power and Privilege. A Theory of Stratification (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966). The sociological theory of gender stratification was developed by Rae Lesser Blumberg, Stratification: Socioeconomic and Sexual Inequality (Dubuque, Iowa: William C. Brown, 1978), and "A General Theory of Gender Stratification," in Sociological Theory 1984, ed. Randall Collins (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1984); by Janet Saltzman Chafetz, Sex and Advantage: A Comparative Macro-Structural Theory of Sexual Stratification (Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Allanheld, 1984), and Gender Equity: An Integrated Theory of Stability and Change (Newbury Park, Calif.: Sage, 1990); and by Joan Huber and Glenna Spitze, Sex Stratification: Children, Housework, and Jobs (New York: Academic Press, 1983). Chafetz's treatment of the dynamics of women's movements and antifeminist movements, written with A. Gary Dworkin, is Female Revolt: Women's Movements in World and Historical Perspective (Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Allanheld, 1986), and "In the Face of Threat: Organized Antifeminism in Comparative Perspective," Gender and Society 1 (1987): 33-60. Randall Collins' comparative theory of sex and politics was first published as "A Conflict Theory of Sexual Stratification," Social Problems 19 (1971), 3-21, and later developed in "Courtly Politics and the Status of Women," in Collins, Weberian Sociological Theory (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986). Path-breaking work by women sociologists ranges from macro to micro. It includes Janet Abu-Lughod, Before European Hegemony: The World System AD 1250-1350 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989); Karen S. Cook, "Network Structures from an Exchange Perspective," in Peter V. Marsden and Nan Lin (eds.), Social Structure and Network Analysis (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1982); and Rosabeth M. Kanter, Men and Women of the Corporation (New York: Basic Books, 1977). Arlie R. Hochschild's major theory of the construction of emotions through "emotion work" is presented in The Managed Heart: The Commercialization of Human Feeling (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983). Sophisticated mathematical sociology is advanced by Nancy Brandon Tuma and Michael T. Hanna, Social Dynamics: Models and Methods (New York: Academic Press, 1984); and by Pamela E. Oliver and Gerald Marwell, "The Paradox of Group Size in Collective Action: A Theory of the Critical Mass," American Sociological Review 53 (1988): 1-8. Dorothy Smith's "standpoint theory" is presented in "A Sociology for Women," in J. A. Sherman and E. T. Beck, The Prism of Sex: Essays in the Sociology of Knowledge (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1979).</p>
