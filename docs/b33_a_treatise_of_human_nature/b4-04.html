		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more usual and more natural for those, who pretend to discover any thing new to the world in philosophy and the sciences, than to insinuate the praises of their own systems, by decrying all those, which have been advanced before them. And indeed were they content with lamenting that ignorance, which we still lie under in the most important questions, that can come before the tribunal of human reason, there are few, who have an acquaintance with the sciences, that would not readily agree with them. ’Tis easy for one of judgment and learning, to perceive the weak foundation even of those systems, which have obtained the greatest credit, and have carried their pretensions highest to accurate and profound reasoning. Principles taken upon trust, consequences lamely deduced from them, want of coherence in the parts, and of evidence in the whole, these are every where to be met with in the systems of the most eminent philosophers, and seem to have drawn disgrace upon philosophy itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">对于那些假装在哲学和科学领域向世界发现任何新事物的人来说，最常见和最自然的事情莫过于通过抨击所有在他们之前提出的体系来影射对他们自己体系的赞美。事实上，如果他们只满足于感叹我们在最重要的问题上仍然处于无知的状态，而这些问题可能会出现在人类理性的法庭上，那么，很少有熟悉科学的人不会轻易同意他们的观点。对一个有判断力和学识的人来说，很容易就能看出那些系统的基础薄弱，而这些系统已经获得了最大的信任，并把它们的主张带到了准确和深刻的推理上。信任的原则，从这些原则中蹩脚地推导出的结果，部分缺乏连贯性，整体缺乏证据，这些在最杰出的哲学家的体系中随处可见，而且似乎让哲学本身蒙羞了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor is there requir’d such profound knowledge to discover the present imperfect condition of the sciences, but even the rabble without doors may judge from the noise and clamour, which they hear, that all goes not well within. There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if every thing was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if every thing was certain. Amidst all this bustle ’tis not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence; and no man needs ever despair of gaining proselytes to the most extravagant hypothesis, who has art enough to represent it in any favourable colours. The victory is not gained by the men at arms, who manage the pike and the sword; but by the trumpeters, drummers, and musicians of the army.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">也不需要如此渊博的知识来发现目前科学的不完善状况，但即使是门外的乌合之众，也可以从他们听到的噪音和喧闹声中判断出内部的一切都不尽人意。没有什么事情不是辩论的主题，也没有什么学问家不持有相反的意见。最微不足道的问题也逃不过我们的争论，而在最重要的问题上，我们也无法给出任何确定的决定。争议成倍增加，仿佛每件事情都是不确定的；而这些争议被处理得非常热烈，仿佛每件事情都是确定的。在这一切喧嚣中，得奖的不是理性，而是口才；没有人需要对获得最夸张的假设的改信者感到绝望，因为他有足够的艺术，可以用任何有利的色彩来表现它。胜利不是由管理长矛和剑的士兵获得的，而是由军队中的号手、鼓手和乐手获得的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds, even amongst those, who profess themselves scholars, and have a just value for every other part of literature. By metaphysical reasonings, they do not understand those on any particular branch of science, but every kind of argument, which is any way abstruse, and requires some attention to be comprehended. We have so often lost our labour in such researches, that we commonly reject them without hesitation, and resolve, if we must for ever be a prey to errors and delusions, that they shall at least be natural and entertaining. And indeed nothing but the most determined scepticism, along with a great degree of indolence, can justify this aversion to metaphysics. For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity, ’tis certain it must lie very deep and abstruse; and to hope we shall arrive at it without pains, while the greatest geniuses have failed with the utmost pains, must certainly be esteemed sufficiently vain and presumptuous. I pretend to no such advantage in the philosophy I am going to unfold, and would esteem it a strong presumption against it, were it so very easy and obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我看来，由此产生了对各种形而上学推理的普遍偏见，甚至在那些自称是学者并对文学的其他部分有公正价值的人中间也是如此。他们所说的形而上学的推理，并不是指关于科学的任何特定分支的推理，而是指每一种论证，无论如何都是深奥的，需要注意才能理解的。我们经常在这种研究中失去劳动成果，所以我们通常毫不犹豫地拒绝它们，并决心，如果我们必须永远成为错误和妄想的猎物，那么它们至少应该是自然的和有趣的。事实上，除了最坚定的怀疑主义，以及极大程度的懒惰，没有什么能证明这种对形而上学的厌恶是合理的。因为如果真理是在人类能力所及的范围内，那么可以肯定的是，它一定是非常深刻和深奥的；在最伟大的天才们费尽心机也无法达到的情况下，希望我们不费吹灰之力就能达到，肯定会被认为是足够的虚荣和冒失。在我将要阐述的哲学中，我并不假装有这样的优势，而且如果它是如此简单和明显，我也会认为这是一个强烈的反对它的假设。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human nature; and that however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even <i class="calibre10">Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion</i>, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man; since they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. ’Tis impossible to tell what changes and improvements we might make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the extent and force of human understanding, and cou’d explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our reasonings. And these improvements are the more to be hoped for in natural religion, as it is not content with instructing us in the nature of superior powers, but carries its views farther, to their disposition towards us, and our duties towards them; and consequently we ourselves are not only the beings, that reason, but also one of the objects, concerning which we reason.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，所有的科学都与人性有或多或少的关系；无论它们中的任何一门似乎离人性有多远，它们还是会通过这样或那样的途径回来的。即使是<i class="calibre10">数学、自然哲学和自然宗教</i>，在某种程度上也依赖于人的科学；因为它们处于人的认知之下，并由人的力量和能力来评判。如果我们彻底了解人类理解力的范围和力量，并能解释我们所使用的思想的性质，以及我们在推理中所进行的操作，那么我们就不可能知道在这些科学中会做出什么样的改变和改进。这些改进在自然宗教中更值得期待，因为它不满足于指导我们了解高级力量的性质，而是把它的观点延伸到它们对我们的态度，以及我们对它们的责任；因此，我们自己不仅是推理的对象，也是我们推理的对象之一。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">If therefore the sciences of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, have such a dependence on the knowledge of man, what may be expected in the other sciences, whose connexion with human nature is more close and intimate? The sole end of logic is to explain the principles and operations of our reasoning faculty, and the nature of our ideas: morals and criticism regard our tastes and sentiments: and politics consider men as united in society, and dependent on each other. In these four sciences of <i class="calibre10">Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics</i>, is comprehended almost every thing, which it can any way import us to be acquainted with, or which can tend either to the improvement or ornament of the human mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，如果数学、自然哲学和自然宗教等科学对人的知识有如此大的依赖性，那么在其他科学中可以期待什么，因为这些科学与人性的联系更加紧密和密切？逻辑学的唯一目的是解释我们推理能力的原理和运作，以及我们思想的性质：道德和批评是关于我们的品味和情感：而政治学则认为人在社会中是团结的，并且相互依赖。在<i class="calibre10">逻辑学、道德学、批评学和政治学</i>这四门科学中，几乎包含了所有能以任何方式让我们了解的东西，或者能有助于改善或装饰人类思想的东西。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Here then is the only expedient, from which we can hope for success in our philosophical researches, to leave the tedious lingring method, which we have hitherto followed, and instead of taking now and then a castle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to the capital or center of these sciences, to human nature itself; which being once masters of, we may every where else hope for an easy victory. From this station we may extend our conquests over all those sciences, which more intimately concern human life, and may afterwards proceed at leisure to discover more fully those, which are the objects of pure curiosity. There is no question of importance, whose decision is not compriz’d in the science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any certainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In pretending therefore to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a foundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any security.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，这是唯一的权宜之计，我们可以希望在我们的哲学研究中获得成功，离开我们迄今为止一直遵循的乏味的林格方法，而不是时不时地在边境上占领一座城堡或村庄，直接向这些科学的首都或中心进军，向人性本身进军；一旦掌握了这些科学，我们就可以在其他任何地方希望获得轻松的胜利。从这个地方开始，我们可以将我们的征服扩展到所有那些与人类生活更密切相关的科学，然后可以在闲暇时更充分地发现那些纯粹的好奇心的对象。没有任何重要的问题，其决定权不在人类的科学中；也没有任何问题，在我们熟悉这门科学之前，可以有把握地决定。因此，在假装解释人性的原则时，我们实际上提出了一个完整的科学体系，它建立在一个几乎全新的基础上，而且是它们能够安全地站在上面的唯一基础。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">And as the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences, so the only solid foundation we can give to this science itself must be laid on experience and observation. ’Tis no astonishing reflection to consider, that the application of experimental philosophy to moral subjects should come after that to natural at the distance of above a whole century; since we find in fact, that there was about the same interval betwixt the origins of these sciences; and that reckoning from Thales to Socrates, the space of time is nearly equal to that betwixt my Lord Bacon<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-201" id="calibre_link-323" title="1">1</a></sup> and some late philosophers in <i class="calibre10">England,</i> who have begun to put the science of man on a new footing, and have engaged the attention, and excited the curiosity of the public. So true it is, that however other nations may rival us in poetry, and excel us in some other agreeable arts, the improvements in reason and philosophy can only be owing to a land of toleration and of liberty.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由于人的科学是其他科学的唯一坚实基础，所以我们能给这门科学本身的唯一坚实基础必须建立在经验和观察之上。考虑到实验哲学在道德课题上的应用应该在自然课题上的应用之后，相隔整整一个世纪，这并不是什么惊人的想法；因为我们发现，事实上，这些科学的起源之间也有差不多的间隔；从泰勒斯到苏格拉底算起，时间的间隔几乎等于我的培根大人<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-201" id="calibre_link-323" title="1">1</a></sup>和<i class="calibre10">英国</i>一些晚期的哲学家之间的时间，他们已经开始把人类的科学放在一个新的基础上，并吸引了公众的注意力，激发了公众的好奇心。事实也是如此，无论其他国家如何在诗歌方面与我们竞争，并在其他一些有趣的艺术方面超越我们，理性和哲学的进步只能归功于一个宽容和自由的国度。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of man will do less honour to our native country than the former in natural philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory, upon account of the greater importance of that science, as well as the necessity it lay under of such a reformation. For to me it seems evident, that the essence of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, it must be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments, and the observation of those particular effects, which result from its different circumstances and situations. And tho’ we must endeavour to render all our principles as universal as possible, by tracing up our experiments to the utmost, and explaining all effects from the simplest and fewest causes, ’tis still certain we cannot go beyond experience; and any hypothesis, that pretends to discover the ultimate original qualities of human nature, ought at first to be rejected as presumptuous and chimerical.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I do not think a philosopher, who would apply himself so earnestly to the explaining the ultimate principles of the soul, would show himself a great master in that very science of human nature, which he pretends to explain, or very knowing in what is naturally satisfactory to the mind of man. For nothing is more certain, than that despair has almost the same effect upon us with enjoyment, and that we are no sooner acquainted with the impossibility of satisfying any desire, than the desire itself vanishes. When we see, that we have arrived at the utmost extent of human reason, we sit down contented; tho’ we be perfectly satisfied in the main of our ignorance, and perceive that we can give no reason for our most general and most refined principles, beside our experience of their reality; which is the reason of the mere vulgar, and what it required no study at first to have discovered for the most particular and most extraordinary phænomenon. And as this impossibility of making any farther progress is enough to satisfy the reader, so the writer may derive a more delicate satisfaction from the free confession of his ignorance, and from his prudence in avoiding that error, into which so many have fallen, of imposing their conjectures and hypotheses on the world for the most certain principles. When this mutual contentment and satisfaction can be obtained betwixt the master and scholar, I know not what more we can require of our philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我认为，一个哲学家如果如此认真地解释灵魂的终极原理，就不会显示出他在他声称要解释的人性科学方面是一个伟大的大师，也不会显示出他对人的心灵自然满意的东西非常了解。因为没有什么比绝望对我们的影响与享受几乎相同更确定的了，我们很快就知道不可能满足任何欲望，而欲望本身却消失了。当我们看到，我们已经达到了人类理性的极限，我们就会心满意足地坐下来；尽管我们对自己的无知完全满意，并意识到，除了我们对其现实的经验之外，我们无法为我们最普遍和最精致的原则提供任何理由；这就是普通人的理由，也是最初不需要研究就能发现的最特殊和最特别的现象。既然这种不可能取得更多进展的情况足以让读者满意，那么作者也可以从他对自己无知的自由坦白中得到更微妙的满足，并从他的谨慎中得到满足，因为他避免了许多人所陷入的错误，即把他们的猜想和假设强加给世界，作为最确定的原则。当大师和学者之间能够获得这种相互的满足和满意时，我不知道我们还能对我们的哲学要求什么。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But if this impossibility of explaining ultimate principles should be esteemed a defect in the science of man, I will venture to affirm, that ’tis a defect common to it with all the sciences, and all the arts, in which we can employ ourselves, whether they be such as are cultivated in the schools of the philosophers, or practised in the shops of the meanest artizans. None of them can go beyond experience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that authority. Moral philosophy has, indeed, this peculiar disadvantage, which is not found in natural, that in collecting its experiments, it cannot make them purposely, with premeditation, and after such a manner as to satisfy itself concerning every particular difficulty which may arise. When I am at a loss to know the effects of one body upon another in any situation, I need only put them in that situation, and observe what results from it. But should I endeavour to clear up after the same manner any doubt in moral philosophy, by placing myself in the same case with that which I consider, ’tis evident this reflection and premeditation would so disturb the operation of my natural principles, as must render it impossible to form any just conclusion from the phænomenon. We must therefore glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common course of the world, by men’s behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their pleasures. Where experiments of this kind are judiciously collected and compared, we may hope to establish on them a science, which will not be inferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility to any other of human comprehension.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，如果这种无法解释终极原则的情况被认为是人类科学的缺陷，那么我敢肯定，这是所有科学和所有艺术的共同缺陷，我们可以利用自己，无论它们是在哲学家的学校里培养的，还是在最卑微的手工业者的商店里实践的。他们都不能超越经验，也不能确立任何不以经验为基础的原则。道德哲学确实有这个特殊的缺点，这是自然界所没有的，即在收集实验时，它不能有目的地、有预谋地、以这样一种方式进行实验，以满足自己对可能出现的每一个特殊困难的需求。当我不知道一个身体在任何情况下对另一个身体的影响时，我只需要把它们放在那种情况下，并观察它的结果。但是，如果我试图以同样的方式澄清道德哲学中的任何疑问，把自己和我所考虑的对象放在同一情况下，很明显，这种思考和预谋会扰乱我的自然原则的运作，以至于不可能从现象中形成任何公正的结论。因此，我们必须从对人类生活的谨慎观察中收集我们在这门科学中的实验，并根据人们在公司、事务和娱乐中的行为，在世界的共同进程中采取这些实验。如果这种实验被明智地收集和比较，我们就有希望在它们的基础上建立一门科学，这门科学在确定性方面不会逊色，在实用性方面也会大大优于人类的任何其他认识。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call Impressions and Ideas. The difference betwixt these consists in the degrees of force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind, and make their way into our thought or consciousness. Those perceptions, which enter with most force and violence, we may name <i class="calibre10">impressions</i>; and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul. By <i class="calibre10">ideas</i> I mean the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning; such as, for instance, are all the perceptions excited by the present discourse, excepting only, those which arise from the sight and touch, and excepting the immediate pleasure or uneasiness it may occasion. I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction. Every one of himself will readily perceive the difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common degrees of these are easily distinguished; tho’ it is not impossible but in particular instances they may very nearly approach to each other. Thus in sleep, in a fever, in madness, or in any very violent emotions of soul, our ideas may approach to our impressions: As on the other hand it sometimes happens, that our impressions are so faint and low, that we cannot distinguish them from our ideas. But notwithstanding this near resemblance in a few instances, they are in general so very different, that no-one can make a scruple to rank them under distinct heads, and assign to each a peculiar name to mark the difference<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-392" id="calibre_link-378" title="2">2</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">人类头脑中的所有感知都分为两种不同的类型，我将称之为印象和理念。两者之间的区别在于它们冲击心灵，并进入我们的思想或意识的力度和活力的程度。那些以最强的力量和暴力进入的感知，我们可以称之为<i class="calibre10">印象</i>；在这个名称下，我包括了我们所有的感觉、激情和情感，因为它们在灵魂中首次出现。我所说的<i class="calibre10">观念</i>是指这些观念在思考和推理中的微弱形象；例如，目前的论述所激发的所有感知，只除了那些从视觉和触觉中产生的感知，也不包括它可能引起的直接快乐或不安。我相信，在解释这一区别时，没有必要用很多文字。每个人都会很容易察觉到感觉和思维之间的区别。它们的共同程度很容易区分；尽管在特殊情况下，它们可能非常接近彼此，但这也不是不可能的。因此，在睡眠中，在发烧中，在疯狂中，或在任何非常激烈的灵魂情绪中，我们的想法可能接近我们的印象。另一方面，有时我们的印象是如此微弱和低下，以至于我们无法将它们与我们的观念区分开来。但是，尽管在少数情况下有这种近似，它们在一般情况下还是非常不同的，以至于没有人能够顾虑到将它们归入不同的类别，并为每一个类别指定一个特殊的名称以标明其区别<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-392" id="calibre_link-378" title="2">2</a></sup>.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is another division of our perceptions, which it will be convenient to observe, and which extends itself both to our impressions and ideas. This division is into Simple and Complex. Simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation. The complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts. Tho’ a particular colour, taste, and smell are qualities all united together in this apple, ’tis easy to perceive they are not the same, but are at least distinguishable from each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们的感知还有另一种划分，观察它将是很方便的，它同时延伸到我们的印象和想法。这种划分分为简单和复杂。简单的知觉或印象和观念是不允许有任何区别或分离的。复杂的则与此相反，可以被区分为不同的部分。虽然一个特定的颜色、味道和气味的品质都在这个苹果中结合在一起，但很容易察觉到它们并不一样，至少是可以相互区分的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Having by these divisions given an order and arrangement to our objects, we may now apply ourselves to consider with the more accuracy their qualities and relations. The first circumstance, that strikes my eye, is the great resemblance betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other particular, except their degree of force and vivacity. The one seem to be in a manner the reflexion of the other; so that all the perceptions of the mind are double, and appear both as impressions and ideas. When I shut my eyes and think of my chamber, the ideas I form are exact representations of the impressions I felt; nor is there any circumstance of the one, which is not to be found in the other. In running over my other perceptions, I find still the same resemblance and representation. Ideas and impressions appear always to correspond to each other. This circumstance seems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">通过这些划分，我们的对象有了一个秩序和安排，现在我们可以更准确地考虑它们的质量和关系。引起我注意的第一个情况是，我们的印象和观念在其他每一个方面都非常相似，除了它们的力量和活力的程度。一个人似乎在某种程度上是另一个人的反射；因此，心灵的所有感知都是双重的，既是印象又是观念。当我闭上眼睛思考我的房间时，我所形成的想法是我所感受到的印象的精确表述；也没有任何一个情况是一个人没有在另一个人身上找到的。在回顾我的其他知觉时，我发现仍然有相同的相似性和代表性。思想和印象似乎总是相互对应的。这种情况在我看来是很显著的，并引起了我的注意。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Upon a more accurate survey I find I have been carried away too far by the first appearance, and that I must make use of the distinction of perceptions into <i class="calibre10">simple and complex</i>, to limit this general decision, <i class="calibre10">that all our ideas and impressions are resembling</i>. I observe, that many of our complex ideas never had impressions, that corresponded to them, and that many of our complex impressions never are exactly copied in ideas. I can imagine to myself such a city as the <i class="calibre10">New Jerusalem</i>, whose pavement is gold and walls are rubies, tho’ I never saw any such. I have seen <i class="calibre10">Paris</i>; but shall I affirm I can form such an idea of that city, as will perfectly represent all its streets and houses in their real and just proportions?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">经过更准确的调查，我发现我被最初的表象带得太远了，我必须利用感知的<i class="calibre10">简单和复杂的</i>区别，来限制这个一般的决定，<i class="calibre10">即我们所有的想法和印象都是相似的</i>。我观察到，我们的许多复杂的观念从来没有与之对应的印象，我们的许多复杂的印象也从来没有在观念中完全复制过。我可以向自己想象这样一座城市，<i class="calibre10">如新耶路撒冷</i>，它的路面是黄金，墙壁是红宝石，尽管我从未见过这样的城市。我见过<i class="calibre10">巴黎</i>；但我能肯定我可以对那座城市形成这样的概念，完全代表它的所有街道和房屋的真实和公正比例吗？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I perceive, therefore, that tho’ there is in general a great resemblance betwixt our <i class="calibre10">complex</i> impressions and ideas, yet the rule is not universally true, that they are exact copies of each other. We may next consider how the case stands with our <i class="calibre10">simple</i> perceptions. After the most accurate examination, of which I am capable, I venture to affirm, that the rule here holds without any exception, and that every simple idea has a simple impression, which resembles it; and every simple impression a correspondent idea. That idea of red, which we form in the dark, and that impression, which strikes our eyes in sun-shine, differ only in degree, not in nature. That the case is the same with all our simple impressions and ideas, ’tis impossible to prove by a particular enumeration of them. Every one may satisfy himself in this point by running over as many as he pleases. But if any one should deny this universal resemblance, I know no way of convincing him, but by desiring him to shew a simple impression, that has not a correspondent idea, or a simple idea, that has not a correspondent impression. If he does not answer this challenge, as ’tis certain he cannot, we may from his silence and our own observation establish our conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我认为，尽管我们的<i class="calibre10">复杂</i>印象和观念之间一般来说有很大的相似性，但这一规则并不普遍正确，即它们是彼此的精确拷贝。我们接下来可以考虑一下我们的<i class="calibre10">简单</i>感知的情况。经过我所能做的最精确的检查，我敢肯定，这里的规则毫无例外地成立，每个简单的观念都有一个与之相似的简单印象；每个简单印象都有一个相应的观念。我们在黑暗中形成的红色概念，和在阳光下映入我们眼帘的印象，只有程度上的不同，没有性质上的区别。我们所有的简单印象和观念的情况都是一样的，不可能通过对它们的特别列举来证明。在这一点上，每个人都可以通过列举他所喜欢的数量来满足自己。但是，如果有人否认这种普遍的相似性，我不知道有什么办法可以说服他，只能请他指出一个没有相应观念的简单印象，或者一个没有相应印象的简单观念。如果他不回答这个挑战，因为他肯定不能回答，我们可以从他的沉默和我们自己的观察中确定我们的结论。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus we find, that all simple ideas and impressions resemble each other; and as the complex are formed from them, we may affirm in general, that these two species of perception are exactly correspondent. Having discover’d this relation, which requires no farther examination, I am curious to find some other of their qualities. Let us consider how they stand with regard to their existence, and which of the impressions and ideas are causes, and which effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们发现，所有简单的观念和印象都是相互类似的；由于复杂的观念和印象是由它们形成的，我们可以笼统地肯定，这两种感知是完全对应的。既然发现了这种关系，就不需要再做进一步的研究，我很想找到它们的其他一些品质。让我们考虑一下它们在存在方面的情况，以及哪些印象和观念是原因，哪些是结果。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">full</i> examination of this question is the subject of the present treatise; and therefore we shall here content ourselves with establishing one general proposition, <i class="calibre10">That all our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv’d from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">对这一问题的<i class="calibre10">全面</i>研究是本论文的主题；因此，我们在此将满足于建立一个一般性的命题：<i class="calibre10">我们所有的简单概念在最初出现时都是由简单的印象派生出来的，这些印象与它们相对应，而且它们完全代表</i>这些印象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In seeking for phænomena to prove this proposition, I find only those of two kinds; but in each kind the phænomena are obvious, numerous, and conclusive. I first make myself certain, by a new review, of what I have already asserted, that every simple impression is attended with a correspondent idea, and every simple idea with a correspondent impression. From this constant conjunction of resembling perceptions I immediately conclude, that there is a great connexion betwixt our correspondent impressions and ideas, and that the existence of the one has a considerable influence upon that of the other. Such a constant conjunction, in such an infinite number of instances, can never arise from chance; but clearly proves a dependence of the impressions on the ideas, or of the ideas on the impressions. That I may know on which side this dependence lies, I consider the order of their <i class="calibre10">first appearance</i>; and find by constant experience, that the simple impressions always take the precedence of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in the contrary order. To give a child an idea of scarlet or orange, of sweet or bitter, I present the objects, or in other words, convey to him these impressions; but proceed not so absurdly, as to endeavour to produce the impressions by exciting the ideas. Our ideas upon their appearance produce not their correspondent impressions, nor do we perceive any colour, or feel any sensation merely upon thinking of them. On the other hand we find, that any impressions either of the mind or body is constantly followed by an idea, which resembles it, and is only different in the degrees of force and liveliness. The constant conjunction of our resembling perceptions, is a convincing proof, that the one are the causes of the other; and this priority of the impressions is an equal proof, that our impressions are the causes of our ideas, not our ideas of our impressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在寻找证明这一命题的现象时，我只找到了两种现象；但每一种现象都是明显的、大量的和结论性的。我首先通过对我已经断言过的东西进行新的回顾，使自己确信，每一个简单的印象都有一个相应的观念，每一个简单的观念都有一个相应的印象。从这种相似感知的不断结合中，我立即得出结论，我们的相应印象和观念之间存在着巨大的联系，而且一个的存在对另一个的存在有相当大的影响。在如此多的情况下，这种持续的结合不可能是偶然产生的；而是清楚地证明了印象对观念的依赖性，或者观念对印象的依赖性。为了知道这种依赖性在哪一边，我考虑了它们<i class="calibre10">第一次出现</i>的顺序；并通过不断的经验发现，简单的印象总是优先于它们相应的观念，但从未以相反的顺序出现。为了给孩子一个关于红色或橙色、甜或苦的概念，我把这些物体呈现出来，或者换句话说，把这些印象传达给他；但不要如此荒唐地试图通过激发观念来产生印象。我们的观念在出现时并没有产生相应的印象，我们也没有感知到任何颜色，或仅仅在想到它们时感到任何感觉。另一方面，我们发现，心灵或身体的任何印象都会不断地被一个想法所跟随，这个想法与它相似，只是在力量和活力的程度上有所不同。我们相似的感知的不断结合，是一个令人信服的证据，即一个是另一个的原因；印象的这种优先性也是一个同样的证据，即我们的印象是我们观念的原因，而不是我们的观念是我们印象的原因。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this I consider another plain and convincing phænomenon; which is, that where-ever by any accident the faculties, which give rise to any impressions, are obstructed in their operations, as when one is born blind or deaf; not only the impressions are lost, but also their correspondent ideas; so that there never appear in the mind the least traces of either of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of sensation are entirely destroy’d, but likewise where they have never been put in action to produce a particular impression. We cannot form to ourselves a just idea of the taste of a pine-apple, without having actually tasted it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证实这一点，我考虑了另一个明显的、令人信服的现象；那就是，无论何时，如果产生任何印象的能力因任何意外而在其运作中受到阻碍，例如当一个人天生失明或失聪时，不仅印象会消失，而且其相应的观念也会消失；因此，在头脑中从未出现过其中任何一种印象的痕迹。这也不仅仅是在感觉器官完全被破坏的情况下，而且也是在它们从未被用来产生特定印象的情况下。如果我们没有真正品尝过松树苹果，就无法对它的味道形成一个正确的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is however one contradictory phænomenon, which may prove, that ’tis not absolutely impossible for ideas to go before their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allow’d, that the several distinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, or those of sounds, which are convey’d by the hearing, are really different from each other, tho’ at the same time resembling. Now if this be true of different colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the same colour, that each of them produces a distinct idea, independent of the rest. For if this shou’d be deny’d, ’tis possible, by the continual gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be plac’d before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; ’tis plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the continguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether ’tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, tho’ it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always derived from the correspondent impressions; tho’ the instance is so particular and singular, that ’tis scarce worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">然而，有一个相互矛盾的现象可以证明，观念先于其相应的印象并不是绝对不可能的。我相信人们很容易接受这样的观点，即通过眼睛进入的几种不同的颜色观念，或通过听觉传达的声音观念，确实是相互不同的，但同时又是相似的。如果不同的颜色是这样，那么同一种颜色的不同色调也一定是这样，它们中的每一种都会产生一个独立于其他颜色的独特概念。因为如果否认这一点，就有可能通过色调的不断渐变，使一种颜色不由自主地变成与之最相近的颜色；如果你不允许任何一种手段是不同的，你就不能不荒谬地否认两端是一样的。因此，假设一个人已经享受了 30 年的视力，并且已经完全熟悉了各种颜色，除了一种特殊的蓝色，比如说，他从来没有幸运地遇到过这种颜色。让所有不同的颜色，除了那一种，都摆在他面前，从最深到最浅逐渐递减；很明显，他将会发现，在缺少那种颜色的地方有一片空白，并且会感觉到，在那个地方，各种颜色之间的距离比其他地方都要大。现在我问，他是否有可能通过自己的想象力来弥补这一缺陷，并向自己提出那个特定色调的概念，尽管它从未通过感官传达给他？我相信很少有人会认为他能做到；这可以作为一个证据，证明简单的想法并不总是来自相应的印象；尽管这个例子是如此特殊和奇特，以至于不值得我们注意，也不值得我们仅仅为它改变我们的一般格言。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But besides this exception, it may not be amiss to remark on this head, that the principle of the priority of impressions to ideas must be understood with another limitation, <i class="calibre10">viz</i>. that as our ideas are images of our impressions, so we can form secondary ideas, which are images of the primary; as appears from this very reasoning concerning them. This is not, properly speaking, an exception to the rule so much as an explanation of it. Ideas produce the images of themselves in new ideas; but as the first ideas are supposed to be derived from impressions, it still remains true, that all our simple ideas proceed either mediately or immediately from their correspondent impressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，除了这个例外，在这个问题上，我们不妨说，印象优先于观念的原则必须被理解为有另一个限制，<i class="calibre10">即</i>：由于我们的观念是我们印象的形象，所以我们可以形成次要的观念，这些观念是主要观念的形象；这一点从关于它们的推理中可以看出。正确地说，这不是对规则的例外，而是对它的解释。观念在新的观念中产生自己的形象；但由于最初的观念被认为是来自于印象，所以仍然是真实的，我们所有的简单观念都是直接或立即从它们相应的印象中产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This then is the first principle I establish in the science of human nature; nor ought we to despise it because of the simplicity of its appearance. For ’tis remarkable, that the present question concerning the precedency of our impressions or ideas, is the same with what has made so much noise in other terms, when it has been disputed whether there be any <i class="calibre10">innate ideas</i>, or whether all ideas be derived from sensation and reflexion. We may observe, that in order to prove the ideas of extension and colour not to be innate, philosophers do nothing but shew, that they are conveyed by our senses. To prove the ideas of passion and desire not to be innate, they observe that we have a preceding experience of these emotions in ourselves. Now if we carefully examine these arguments, we shall find that they prove nothing but that ideas are preceded by other more lively perceptions, from which they are derived, and which they represent. I hope this clear stating of the question will remove all disputes concerning it, and will render this principle of more use in our reasonings, than it seems hitherto to have been.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是我在人性科学中确立的第一个原则；我们也不应该因为它的外表简单而轻视它。因为值得注意的是，目前关于我们的印象或观念的优先次序的问题，与其他方面的问题是一样的，当时人们对是否有任何<i class="calibre10">先天的观念</i>，或者所有的观念是否来自于感觉和反思有争议。我们可以看到，为了证明延伸和颜色的观念不是天生的，哲学家们除了说明它们是由我们的感官传达的以外，什么也没做。为了证明激情和欲望的观念不是与生俱来的，他们观察到，我们在自己身上有这些情绪的先期经验。现在，如果我们仔细研究这些论据，就会发现它们除了证明观念是由其他更活泼的知觉先于它们产生的，而且它们也代表了这些知觉。我希望对这一问题的明确阐述将消除所有与之相关的争议，并使这一原则在我们的推理中比迄今为止似乎更有用。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since it appears, that our simple impressions are prior to their correspondent ideas, and that the exceptions are very rare, method seems to require we should examine our impressions, before we consider our ideas. Impressions may be divided into two kinds, those of Sensation and those of Reflexion. The first kind arises in the soul originally, from unknown causes. The second is derived in a great measure from our ideas, and that in the following order. An impression first strikes upon the senses, and makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain of some kind or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken by the mind, which remains after the impression ceases; and this we call an idea. This idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul, produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, which may properly be called impressions of reflexion, because derived from it. These again are copied by the memory and imagination, and become ideas; which perhaps in their turn give rise to other impressions and ideas. So that the impressions of reflexion are only antecedent to their correspondent ideas; but posterior to those of sensation, and deriv’d from them. The examination of our sensations belongs more to anatomists and natural philosophers than to moral; and therefore shall not at present be enter’d upon. And as the impressions of reflexion, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> passions, desires, and emotions, which principally deserve our attention, arise mostly from ideas, ’twill be necessary to reverse that method, which at first sight seems most natural; and in order to explain the nature and principles of the human mind, give a particular account of ideas, before we proceed to impressions. For this reason I have here chosen to begin with ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然我们的简单印象似乎先于其相应的观念，而且例外的情况非常少，那么方法似乎要求我们在考虑我们的观念之前，先检查我们的印象。印象可以分为两种，一种是感觉，一种是反思。第一种印象最初是在灵魂中产生的，来自未知的原因。第二种印象在很大程度上来自我们的观念，而且是按以下顺序产生的。一种印象首先冲击着感官，使我们感觉到热或冷、渴或饿、某种快乐或痛苦。对于这种印象，头脑中会有一个副本，在印象消失后仍然存在；这就是我们所说的观念。这种快乐或痛苦的观念，当它回到灵魂上时，会产生新的欲望和厌恶、希望和恐惧的印象，这些印象可以恰当地称为反思的印象，因为它们来自反思。这些印象又被记忆和想象力所复制，成为观念；这些观念可能又会产生其他的印象和观念。因此，反思的印象只是在其相应的观念之前；但在感觉的印象之后，并且是从它们派生出来的。对我们的感觉的研究更多的是属于解剖学家和自然哲学家，而不是道德学家；因此，现在不应讨论这个问题。由于反思的印象，<i class="calibre10">即</i>主要值得我们注意的激情、欲望和情感，主要来自于观念，因此有必要颠倒一下初看起来最自然的方法；为了解释人类心灵的本质和原则，在我们开始讨论印象之前，先对观念作一个特别的说明。由于这个原因，我在这里选择从观念开始。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">We find by experience, that when any impression has been present with the mind, it again makes its appearance there as an idea; and this it may do after two different ways: either when in its new appearance it retains a considerable degree of its first vivacity, and is somewhat intermediate betwixt an impression and an idea; or when it entirely loses that vivacity, and is a perfect idea. The faculty, by which we repeat our impressions in the first manner, is called the Memory, and the other the Imagination. ’Tis evident at first sight, that the ideas of the memory are much more lively and strong than those of the imagination, and that the former faculty paints its objects in more distinct colours, than any which are employ’d by the latter. When we remember any past event, the idea of it flows in upon the mind in a forcible manner; whereas in the imagination the perception is faint and languid, and cannot without difficulty be preserv’d by the mind steddy and uniform for any considerable time. Here then is a sensible difference betwixt one species of ideas and another. But of this more fully hereafter<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-181" id="calibre_link-445" title="3">3</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们根据经验发现，当任何印象出现在头脑中时，它就会以一种观念的形式再次出现在那里；它可能以两种不同的方式出现：一种是在其新的外观中保留了相当程度的最初的活力，并在某种程度上介于印象和观念之间；另一种是完全失去了这种活力，成为一个完美的观念。我们以第一种方式重复我们的印象的能力被称为记忆，而另一种能力被称为想象。一看就知道，记忆力的观念比想象力的观念更生动、更强烈，而且前者的能力比后者所使用的任何色彩更鲜明地描绘其对象。当我们回忆起任何过去的事件时，它的概念会以一种强有力的方式在脑海中流动；而在想象中，感知是微弱的、无精打采的，在相当长的时间内，头脑不可能毫无困难地保持稳定和一致。这就是一种观念和另一种观念之间的明显区别。但关于这一点，下文会有更充分的说明<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-181" id="calibre_link-445" title="3">3</a></sup>.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is another difference betwixt these two kinds of ideas, which is no less evident, namely that tho’ neither the ideas of the memory nor imagination, neither the lively nor faint ideas can make their appearance in the mind, unless their correspondent impressions have gone before to prepare the way for them, yet the imagination is not restrain’d to the same order and form with the original impressions; while the memory is in a manner ty’d down in that respect, without any power of variation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这两种观念之间还有一个同样明显的区别，即无论是记忆中的观念还是想象中的观念，无论是活泼的还是微弱的观念，都不能在头脑中出现，除非它们相应的印象已经走在前面为它们做准备，但想象力并没有被限制在与原始印象相同的秩序和形式中；而记忆在这方面被束缚住，没有任何变化的能力。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, that the memory preserves the original form, in which its objects were presented, and that where-ever we depart from it in recollecting any thing, it proceeds from some defect or imperfection in that faculty. An historian may, perhaps, for the more convenient carrying on of his narration, relate an event before another, to which it was in fact posterior; but then he takes notice of this disorder, if he be exact; and by that means replaces the idea in its due position. ’Tis the same case in our recollection of those places and persons, with which we were formerly acquainted. The chief exercise of the memory is not to preserve the simple ideas, but their order and position. In short, this principle is supported by such a number of common and vulgar phænomena, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of insisting on it any farther. The same evidence follows us in our second principle, <i class="calibre10">of the liberty of the imagination to transpose and change its ideas</i>. The fables we meet with in poems and romances put this entirely out of question. Nature there is totally confounded, and nothing mentioned but winged horses, fiery dragons, and monstrous giants. Nor will this liberty of the fancy appear strange, when we consider, that all our ideas are copy’d from our impressions, and that there are not any two impressions which are perfectly inseparable. Not to mention, that this is an evident consequence of the division of ideas into simple and complex. Where-ever the imagination perceives a difference among ideas, it can easily produce a separation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，记忆保留了它的对象所呈现的原始形式，而无论我们在回忆任何事情时偏离它，都是由于这种能力的某些缺陷或不完善。一个历史学家也许会为了更方便地进行叙述，在另一个事件之前讲述一个事件，而这个事件实际上是后发的；但如果他是准确的，他就会注意到这种混乱；并通过这种方式将概念替换到其应有的位置。在我们回忆那些我们以前熟悉的地方和人物时，情况也是如此。记忆的主要作用不是保存简单的概念，而是保存它们的顺序和位置。简而言之，这一原则得到了许多常见和粗俗现象的支持，因此我们可以不必再坚持这一原则了。在我们的第二个原则中也有同样的证据，即<i class="calibre10">想象力可以自由地转换和改变它的想法</i>。我们在诗歌和罗曼蒂克中看到的寓言故事使这一点完全成了问题。在那里，自然界被完全混淆了，除了有翼的马、火龙和畸形的巨人，什么都没有提到。当我们考虑到我们所有的想法都是从我们的印象中复制出来的，而且没有任何两个印象是完全不可分割的，这种想象的自由也不会显得奇怪。更不用说，这是观念分为简单和复杂的一个明显的结果。只要想象力觉察到观念之间的差异，它就能轻易地产生分离。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">As all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, and may be united again in what form it pleases, nothing wou’d be more unaccountable than the operations of that faculty, were it not guided by some universal principles, which render it, in some measure, uniform with itself in all times and places. Were ideas entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone wou’d join them; and ’tis impossible the same simple ideas should fall regularly into complex ones (as they commonly do) without some bond of union among them, some associating quality, by which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting principle among ideas is not to be consider’d as an inseparable connexion; for that has been already excluded from the imagination: Nor yet are we to conclude, that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing is more free than that faculty: but we are only to regard it as a gentle force, which commonly prevails, and is the cause why, among other things, languages so nearly correspond to each other; nature in a manner pointing out to every one those simple ideas, which are most proper to be united into a complex one. The qualities, from which this association arises, and by which the mind is after this manner convey’d from one idea to another, are three, <i class="calibre10">viz</i>. Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause and Effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由于所有简单的想法都可以被想象力分开，并可以以它喜欢的形式重新结合起来，如果不是在一些普遍的原则指导下，使它在某种程度上在所有时间和地点与自己保持一致，没有什么比这种能力的运作更令人费解了。如果思想完全是松散的、没有联系的，那么只有机会才能把它们连接起来；如果没有它们之间的某种结合的纽带，某种关联的品质，一个思想自然而然地引入另一个思想，那么同样的简单思想就不可能有规律地落入复杂的思想中（就像它们通常做的那样）。观念之间的这种结合原则不应视为不可分割的联系；因为那已经被排除在想象之外。我们也不能断定，没有它，思想就不能把两个观念结合起来；因为没有什么比这种能力更自由的了：我们只能把它看作是一种温和的力量，这种力量普遍存在，而且是语言之所以如此接近于相互对应的原因；大自然以一种方式向每个人指出了那些最适合结合成一个复杂观念的简单观念。这种关联产生的特质，以及心灵以这种方式从一个概念传递到另一个概念的特质有三个，<i class="calibre10">即</i>：相似性、时间或地点的连续性，以及因果关系。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I believe it will not be very necessary to prove, that these qualities produce an association among ideas, and upon the appearance of one idea naturally introduce another. ’Tis plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that <i class="calibre10">resembles</i> it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. ’Tis likewise evident, that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie <i class="calibre10">contiguous</i> to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects. As to the connexion, that is made by the relation of <i class="calibre10">cause and effect</i>, we shall have occasion afterwards to examine it to the bottom, and therefore shall not at present insist upon it. ’Tis sufficient to observe, that there is no relation, which produces a stronger connexion in the fancy, and makes one idea more readily recall another, than the relation of cause and effect betwixt their objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我相信不需要证明，这些品质在各种观念之间产生了联系，并且在一个观念出现时自然而然地引入了另一个观念。很明显，在我们的思维过程中，在我们的观念的不断变化中，我们的想象力很容易从一个观念跑到任何与之<i class="calibre10">相似</i>的其他观念，而且仅这种品质对想象力来说就足以成为一种纽带和联想。同样明显的是，由于感官在改变它们的对象时，必须有规律地改变它们，并在它们彼此<i class="calibre10">相邻</i>时取舍它们，想象力必须通过长期的习惯获得同样的思维方法，并在构思它的对象时沿着空间和时间的部分运行。至于<i class="calibre10">因果关系</i>所产生的联系，我们以后会有机会对其进行深入研究，因此目前不会坚持这一观点。我们只需注意到，没有任何一种关系能在想象中产生更强的联系，并使一个想法更容易想起另一个想法，而不是它们的对象之间的因果关系。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That we may understand the full extent of these relations, we must consider, that two objects are connected together in the imagination, not only when the one is immediately resembling, contiguous to, or the cause of the other, but also when there is interposed betwixt them a third object, which bears to both of them any of these relations. This may be carried on to a great length; tho’ at the same time we may observe, that each remove considerably weakens the relation. Cousins in the fourth degree are connected by <i class="calibre10">causation</i>, if I may be allowed to use that term; but not so closely as brothers, much less as child and parent. In general we may observe, that all the relations of blood depend upon cause and effect, and are esteemed near or remote, according to the number of connecting causes interpos’d betwixt the persons.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了让我们理解这些关系的全部范围，我们必须考虑到，两个物体在想象中是联系在一起的，不仅当一个物体与另一个物体直接相似、相邻，或者是另一个物体的原因，而且当它们之间夹杂着第三个物体，这个物体与它们都有任何这些关系。这种情况可能会持续很长时间；但同时我们也可以看到，每一次移除都会大大削弱这种关系。如果我可以使用这个词的话，四等的表兄弟是通过<i class="calibre10">因果关系</i>联系在一起的；但不像兄弟那么密切，更不像孩子和父母。总的来说，我们可以看到，所有的血缘关系都取决于因果关系，并根据人与人之间的连接原因的数量而被视为近亲或远亲。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Of the three relations above-mention’d this of causation is the most extensive. Two objects may be consider’d as plac’d in this relation, as well when one is the cause of any of the actions or motions of the other, as when the former is the cause of the existence of the latter. For as that action or motion is nothing but the object itself, consider’d in a certain light, and as the object continues the same in all its different situations, ’tis easy to imagine how such an influence of objects upon one another may connect them in the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在上面提到的三种关系中，因果关系是最广泛的。当一个物体是另一个物体的任何行动或运动的原因时，以及当前者是后者的存在的原因时，两个物体都可以被视为置于这种关系中。因为行动或运动只不过是物体本身，从某种角度考虑，而且物体在所有不同的情况下都是一样的，所以很容易想象物体对彼此的这种影响是如何在想象中把它们联系起来。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may carry this farther, and remark, not only that two objects are connected by the relation of cause and effect, when the one produces a motion or any action in the other, but also when it has a power of producing it. And this we may observe to be the source of all the relations of interest and duty, by which men influence each other in society, and are plac’d in the ties of government and subordination. A master is such-a-one as by his situation, arising either from force or agreement, has a power of directing in certain particulars the actions of another, whom we call servant. A judge is one, who in all disputed cases can fix by his opinion the possession or property of any thing betwixt any members of the society. When a person is possess’d of any power, there is no more required to convert it into action, but the exertion of the will; and <i class="calibre10">that</i> in every case is consider’d as possible, and in many as probable; especially in the case of authority, where the obedience of the subject is a pleasure and advantage to the superior.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以进一步指出，不仅当一个物体在另一个物体中产生运动或任何行动时，而且当它有能力产生运动或行动时，两个物体就通过因果关系联系起来。我们可以看到，这是所有利益和责任关系的来源，人们通过这种关系在社会中相互影响，并被安置在政府和下属的关系中。主人是指这样的人，由于他的处境，无论是武力还是协议，都有权力在某些细节上指导另一个人的行动，我们称之为仆人。法官是指在所有有争议的案件中，可以通过他的意见确定社会任何成员之间任何事物的占有或财产。当一个人拥有任何权力时，不需要再把它转化为行动，只需要发挥意志；在每一种情况下，<i class="calibre10">这</i>都被认为是可能的，在许多情况下是可能的；特别是在权力的情况下，主体的服从对上级来说是一种快乐和好处。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">These are therefore the principles of union or cohesion among our simple ideas, and in the imagination supply the place of that inseparable connexion, by which they are united in our memory. Here is a kind of Attraction, which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to shew itself in as many and as various forms. Its effects are every where conspicuous; but as to its causes, they are mostly unknown, and must be resolv’d into <i class="calibre10">original</i> qualities of human nature, which I pretend not to explain. Nothing is more requisite for a true philosopher, than to restrain the intemperate desire of searching into causes, and having establish’d any doctrine upon a sufficient number of experiments, rest contented with that, when he sees a farther examination would lead him into obscure and uncertain speculations. In that case his enquiry wou’d be much better employ’d in examining the effects than the causes of his principle.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，这些是我们简单概念之间的联合或凝聚的原则，在想象力中提供了不可分割的联系的地方，通过这种联系，它们在我们的记忆中结合起来。这是一种吸引力，它在精神世界中的作用和在自然界中的作用一样大，而且以同样多和不同的形式显示出来。它的效果在任何地方都很明显；但至于它的原因，大多不为人知，必须将其分解为人性的<i class="calibre10">原始</i>品质，我不想解释这些。对于一个真正的哲学家来说，没有什么比克制住探究原因的无度欲望更重要的了，当他看到进一步的研究会把他带入晦涩难懂的猜测时，他就会满足于此，在足够多的实验基础上确立任何学说。在这种情况下，他的调查最好是用于研究他的原则的效果而不是原因。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The word Relation is commonly used in two senses considerably different from each other. Either for that quality, by which two ideas are connected together in the imagination, and the one naturally introduces the other, after the manner above-explained; or for that particular circumstance, in which, even upon the arbitrary union of two ideas in the fancy, we may think proper to compare them. In common language the former is always the sense, in which we use the word, relation; and ’tis only in philosophy, that we extend it to mean any particular subject of comparison, without a connecting principle. Thus distance will be allowed by philosophers to be a true relation, because we acquire an idea of it by the comparing of objects: But in a common way we say, <i class="calibre10">that nothing can be more distant than such or such things from each other, nothing can have less relation</i>; as if distance and relation were incompatible.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">关系这个词通常在两种意义上使用，彼此之间有很大的不同。一种是指两种观念在想象中联系在一起的性质，一种自然地引入另一种，按照上面解释的方式；另一种是指那种特殊情况，在这种情况下，即使两个观念在想象中任意结合，我们也会认为应该对它们进行比较。在普通语言中，前者总是我们使用 “关系” 一词的意义；只有在哲学中，我们才把它扩展到指任何特定的比较对象，而没有一个连接原则。因此，距离会被哲学家们认为是一种真正的关系，因为我们通过对物体的比较获得了对它的概念。但是，我们以一种普通的方式说，<i class="calibre10">没有什么比这样或那样的事物彼此之间的距离更远，没有什么关系更小</i>；好像距离和关系是不相容的。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">

		<p class="block_6 en">It may perhaps be esteemed an endless task to enumerate all those qualities, which make objects admit of comparison, and by which the ideas of <i class="calibre10">philosophical</i> relation are produced. But if we diligently consider them, we shall find that without difficulty they may be compriz’d under seven general heads, which may be considered as the sources of all <i class="calibre10">philosophical</i> relation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">要列举出所有这些使物体可以进行比较的品质，并通过这些品质产生<i class="calibre10">哲学</i>关系的概念，也许会被认为是一项无休止的任务。但是，如果我们勤奋地考虑它们，我们就会发现，它们可以毫无困难地编入七个一般的标题之下，这些标题可以被视为所有<i class="calibre10">哲学</i>关系的来源。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">1. The first is <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>: And this is a relation, without which no philosophical relation can exist; since no objects will admit of comparison, but what have some degree of resemblance. But tho’ resemblance be necessary to all philosophical relation, it does not follow, that it always produces a connexion or association of ideas. When a quality becomes very general, and is common to a great many individuals, it leads not the mind directly to any one of them; but by presenting at once too great a choice, does thereby prevent the imagination from fixing on any single object.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">1. 首先是<i class="calibre10">相似性</i>。这是一种关系，没有这种关系，任何哲学关系都不可能存在；因为除了具有某种程度的相似性之外，没有任何对象可以进行比较。但是，尽管相似性是所有哲学关系所必需的，但这并不意味着它总是产生思想的联系或关联。当一种品质变得非常普遍，并为许多人所共有时，它并不直接将人们的思想引向其中的任何一个；但由于一下子提出了太多的选择，从而使想象力无法固定在任何单一的对象上。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">2. <i class="calibre10">Identity</i> may be esteem’d a second species of relation. This relation I here consider as apply’d in its strictest sense to constant and unchangeable objects; without examining the nature and foundation of personal identity, which shall find its place afterwards. Of all relations the most universal is that of identity, being common to every being, whose existence has any duration.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">2.<i class="calibre10">身份</i>可以被视为第二种关系。在这里，我认为这种关系在其最严格的意义上适用于恒定和不可改变的对象；而没有研究个人身份的性质和基础，这将在后面找到它的位置。在所有的关系中，最普遍的是身份关系，它是每一个存在有任何期限的生命所共有的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">3. After identity the most universal and comprehensive relations are those of <i class="calibre10">Space</i> and <i class="calibre10">Time</i>, which are the sources of an infinite number of comparisons, such as <i class="calibre10">distant, contiguous, above, below, before, after</i>, &amp;c.</p>

When any two objects possess the same <i class="calibre10">quality</i> in common, the <i class="calibre10">degrees</i>, in which they possess it, form a fifth species of relation. Thus of two objects, which are both heavy, the one may be either of greater, or less weight than with the other. Two colours, that are of the same kind, may yet be of different shades, and in that respect admit of comparison.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">5. 当任何两个物体共同拥有相同的<i class="calibre10">质量</i>时，它们拥有的<i class="calibre10">程度</i>就形成了第五种关系。因此，在两个都很重的物体中，一个可能比另一个更重，或者更轻。两种颜色，虽然是同类的，但可能有不同的色调，在这方面可以进行比较。</p></div>

The relation of <i class="calibre10">contrariety</i> may at first sight be regarded as an exception to the rule, <i class="calibre10">that no relation of any kind can subsist without some degree of resemblance</i>. But let us consider, that no two ideas are in themselves contrary, except those of existence and non-existence, which are plainly resembling, as implying both of them an idea of the object; tho’ the latter excludes the object from all times and places, in which it is supposed not to exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">6. 乍一看，<i class="calibre10">对立</i>的关系可能被视为规则的例外，<i class="calibre10">即任何种类的关系如果没有某种程度的相似性就不可能存在</i>。但是，让我们考虑一下，除了存在和不存在的概念外，没有任何两个概念本身是相反的，这两个概念显然是相似的，因为它们都意味着对象的概念；尽管后者将对象排除在所有时间和地点之外，在这些时间和地点中，它被认为是不存在的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I wou’d fain ask those philosophers, who found so much of their reasonings on the distinction of substance and accident, and imagine we have clear ideas of each, whether the idea of <i class="calibre10">substance</i> be deriv’d from the impressions of sensation or reflexion? If it be convey’d to us by our senses, I ask, which of them; and after what manner? If it be perceiv’d by the eyes, it must be a colour; if by the ears, a sound; if by the palate, a taste; and so of the other senses. But I believe none will assert, that substance is either a colour, or sound, or a taste. The idea of substance must therefore be deriv’d from an impression or reflexion, if it really exist. But the impressions of reflexion resolve themselves into our passions and emotions; none of which can possibly represent a substance. We have therefore no idea of substance, distinct from that of a collection of particular qualities, nor have we any other meaning when we either talk or reason concerning it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我很想问那些哲学家，他们在物质和意外的区别上找到了很多推理，并认为我们对每一种都有明确的概念，那么<i class="calibre10">物质</i>的概念是否来自感觉或反射的印象？如果它是由我们的感官传递给我们的，我问，是哪种感官；以何种方式？如果它是由眼睛感知的，它一定是一种颜色；如果是由耳朵感知的，是一种声音；如果是由上颚感知的，是一种味道；其他感官也是如此。但我相信没有人会断言，物质要么是一种颜色，要么是一种声音，要么是一种味道。因此，如果物质的概念真的存在，就必须从印象或反射中衍生出来。但反思的印象会转化为我们的激情和情绪；这些都不可能代表物质。因此，我们没有与特定品质的集合不同的物质概念，当我们谈论或推理它时，也没有任何其他意义。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The idea of a substance as well as that of a mode, is nothing but a collection of simple ideas, that are united by the imagination, and have a particular name assigned them, by which we are able to recall, either to ourselves or others, that collection. But the difference betwixt these ideas consists in this, that the particular qualities, which form a substance, are commonly refer’d to an unknown <i class="calibre10">something</i>, in which they are supposed to inhere; or granting this fiction should not take place, are at least supposed to be closely and inseparably connected by the relations of contiguity and causation. The effect of this is, that whatever new simple quality we discover to have the same connexion with the rest, we immediately comprehend it among them, even tho’ it did not enter into the first conception of the substance. Thus our idea of gold may at first be a yellow colour, weight, malleableness, fusibility; but upon the discovery of its dissolubility in <i class="calibre10">aqua regia</i>, we join that to the other qualities, and suppose it to belong to the substance as much as if its idea had from the beginning made a part of the compound one. The principle of union being regarded as the chief part of the complex idea, gives entrance to whatever quality afterwards occurs, and is equally comprehended by it, as are the others, which first presented themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">物质的概念和模式的概念一样，只不过是一些简单概念的集合，这些概念通过想象力结合在一起，并有一个特定的名称，通过这个名称，我们能够向自己或他人回忆起这个集合。但是，这些观念之间的区别在于，构成物质的特定品质通常被称为一种未知<i class="calibre10">的东西</i>，它们被认为是存在于其中的；或者说，如果这种虚构不发生，至少被认为是通过连续性和因果关系而紧密不可分割的。这样做的结果是，无论我们发现什么新的简单质量与其他质量有相同的联系，我们都会立即把它理解为它们中的一种，即使它没有进入物质的最初概念。因此，我们对黄金的概念最初可能是黄色、重量、可塑性和可熔性；但在发现它在<i class="calibre10">王水中</i>的可溶性后，我们就把它与其他品质联系起来，并认为它属于这种物质，就像它的概念从一开始就成为化合物的一部分。结合的原则被视为复合概念的主要部分，为后来出现的任何质量提供了入口，并且与最初出现的其他质量一样，同样被它所包含。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That this cannot take place in modes, is evident from considering their nature. The simple ideas of which modes are formed, either represent qualities, which are not united by contiguity and causation, but are dispers’d in different subjects; or if they be all united together, the uniting principle is not regarded as the foundation of the complex idea. The idea of a dance is an instance of the first kind of modes; that of beauty of the second. The reason is obvious, why such complex ideas cannot receive any new idea, without changing the name, which distinguishes the mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">考虑到模式的性质，这一点在模式中不可能发生，是很明显的。形成模式的简单概念，要么代表的是质量，而这些质量并没有通过毗连和因果关系结合在一起，而是分散在不同的主体中；或者，如果它们都结合在一起，结合的原则并不被视为复杂概念的基础。舞蹈的概念是第一种模式的一个例子；美的概念是第二种模式。原因很明显，为什么这种复杂的观念不能接受任何新的观念，而不改变区分模式的名称呢？</p></div>

A <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-441" id="calibre_link-165" title="4">4</a></sup>great philosopher has disputed the receiv’d opinion in this particular, and has asserted, that all general ideas are nothing but particular ones, annexed to a certain term, which gives them a more extensive signification, and makes them recall upon occasion other individuals, which are similar to them. As I look upon this to be one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of letters, I shall here endeavour to confirm it by some arguments, which I hope will put it beyond all doubt and controversy.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, that in forming most of our general ideas, if not all of them, we abstract from every particular degree of quantity and quality, and that an object ceases not to be of any particular species on account of every small alteration in its extension, duration and other properties. It may therefore be thought, that here is a plain dilemma, that decides concerning the nature of those abstract ideas, which have afforded so much speculation to philosophers. The abstract idea of a man represents men of all sizes and all qualities; which ’tis concluded it cannot do, but either by representing at once all possible sizes and all possible qualities, or by representing no particular one at all. Now it having been esteemed absurd to defend the former proposition, as implying an infinite capacity in the mind, it has been commonly infer’d in favour of the latter; and our abstract ideas have been suppos’d to represent no particular degree either of quantity or quality. But that this inference is erroneous, I shall endeavour to make appear, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, by proving, that ’tis utterly impossible to conceive any quantity or quality, without forming a precise notion of its degrees: And <i class="calibre10">secondly</i> by showing, that tho’ the capacity of the mind be not infinite, yet we can at once form a notion of all possible degrees of quantity and quality, in such a manner at least, as, however imperfect, may serve all the purposes of reflexion and conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，在形成我们大多数的一般观念时，如果不是全部的话，我们从数量和质量的每一个特定程度中抽象出来，而且一个物体由于其延伸、持续时间和其他属性的每一个微小变化而不再属于任何特定的种类。因此可以认为，这里有一个简单的难题，决定了那些抽象概念的性质，而这些抽象概念已经给哲学家们带来了许多猜测。一个人的抽象概念代表了所有尺寸和所有品质的人；我们的结论是，它不可能做到这一点，但要么同时代表所有可能的尺寸和所有可能的品质，要么根本不代表任何特定的人。现在，人们认为为前一个命题辩护是荒谬的，因为它意味着头脑中有无限的能力，所以通常会推断为支持后一个命题；我们的抽象概念被认为是不代表数量或质量的特定程度。但这种推论是错误的，我将努力使之显现出来，<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，我将证明，如果不对其程度形成一个精确的概念，就完全不可能设想出任何数量或质量。<i class="calibre10">其次</i>，我将证明，尽管心灵的容量不是无限的，但我们可以立即形成所有可能的数量和质量程度的概念，其方式至少是这样的，尽管不完善，但可以满足反思和交谈的所有目的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the first proposition, <i class="calibre10">that the mind cannot form any notion of quantity or quality without forming a precise notion of degrees of each</i>; we may prove this by the three following arguments. First, We have observ’d, that whatever objects are different are distinguishable, and that whatever objects are distinguishable are separable by the thought and imagination. And we may here add, that these propositions are equally true in the <i class="calibre10">inverse</i>, and that whatever objects are separable are also distinguishable, and that whatever objects are distinguishable are also different. For how is it possible we can separate what is not distinguishable, or distinguish what is not different? In order therefore to know, whether abstraction implies a separation, we need only consider it in this view, and examine, whether all the circumstances, which we abstract from in our general ideas, be such as are distinguishable and different from those, which we retain as essential parts of them. But ’tis evident at first sight, that the precise length of a line is not different nor distinguishable from the line itself; nor the precise degree of any quality from the quality. These ideas, therefore, admit no more of separation than they do of distinction and difference. They are consequently conjoined with each other in the conception; and the general idea of a line, notwithstanding all our abstractions and refinements, has in its appearance in the mind a precise degree of quantity and quality; however it may be made to represent others, which have different degrees of both.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先是第一个命题，<i class="calibre10">即如果不对每一种物体的程度形成精确的概念，心灵就不能形成任何数量或质量</i>的概念；我们可以通过以下三个论点来证明这一点。首先，我们已经注意到，凡是不同的物体都是可以区分的，凡是可以区分的物体都是可以通过思想和想象力区分的。在此，我们可以补充说，这些命题在<i class="calibre10">反面</i>也同样正确，凡是可分离的物体也是可区分的，凡是可区分的物体也是不同的。因为我们怎么可能把无法区分的东西分开，或把没有区别的东西区分出来呢？因此，为了知道抽象是否意味着分离，我们只需从这个角度考虑，并检查我们在一般观念中抽象出来的所有情况，是否与我们作为其基本部分保留的情况有区别和不同。但一目了然的是，一条线的精确长度与线本身没有区别，也无法区分；任何质量的精确程度与质量也没有区别。因此，这些概念不允许分离，就像它们不允许有区别和差异。因此，它们在概念中是相互结合的；尽管我们进行了所有的抽象和细化，但线的一般概念在头脑中的表现是数量和质量的精确程度；无论它如何被用来代表其他具有两者不同程度的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, ’tis confest, that no object can appear to the senses; or in other words, that no impression can become present to the mind, without being determin’d in its degrees both of quantity and quality. The confusion, in which impressions are sometimes involv’d, proceeds only from their faintness and unsteadiness, not from any capacity in the mind to receive any impression, which in its real existence has no particular degree nor proportion. That is a contradiction in terms; and even implies the flattest of all contradictions, <i class="calibre10">viz</i>. that ’tis possible for the same thing both to be and not to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，我们承认，没有任何物体可以出现在感官上；或者换句话说，没有任何印象可以在数量和质量上不被确定的情况下出现在心灵上。印象有时会出现混乱，这只是因为它们的虚弱和不稳定，而不是因为头脑中接受任何印象的能力，这些印象在其实际存在中没有特定的程度或比例。这是一个术语上的矛盾；甚至意味着所有矛盾中最简单的矛盾，<i class="calibre10">即</i>同一事物既可能是也可能不是。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now since all ideas are deriv’d from impressions, and are nothing but copies and representations of them, whatever is true of the one must be acknowledg’d concerning the other. Impressions and ideas differ only in their strength and vivacity. The foregoing conclusion is not founded on any particular degree of vivacity. It cannot therefore be affected by any variation in that particular. An idea is a weaker impression; and as a strong impression must necessarily have a determinate quantity and quality, the case must be the same with its copy or representative.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然所有的观念都来自于印象，而且无非是印象的复制和表现，那么，凡是对前者正确的，都必须承认对后者正确。印象和观念的不同只在于它们的力量和活力。上述结论并不是建立在任何特定的活泼程度上的。因此，它不可能受到该方面的任何变化的影响。观念是一个较弱的印象；由于一个强烈的印象必然有一个确定的数量和质量，其副本或代表的情况也必然是一样的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, ’tis a principle generally receiv’d in philosophy, that every thing in nature is individual, and that ’tis utterly absurd to suppose a triangle really existent, which has no precise proportion of sides and angles. If this therefore be absurd in <i class="calibre10">fact and reality</i>, it must also be absurd <i class="calibre10">in idea</i>; since nothing of which we can form a clear and distinct idea is absurd and impossible. But to form the idea of an object, and to form an idea simply is the same thing; the reference of the idea to an object being an extraneous denomination, of which in itself it bears no mark or character. Now as ’tis impossible to form an idea of an object, that is possest of quantity and quality, and yet is possest of no precise degree of either; it follows, that there is an equal impossibility of forming an idea, that is not limited and confin’d in both these particulars. Abstract ideas are therefore in themselves individual, however they may become general in their representation. The image in the mind is only that of a particular object, tho’ the application of it in our reasoning be the same, as if it were universal.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This application of ideas beyond their nature proceeds from our collecting all their possible degrees of quantity and quality in such an imperfect manner as may serve the purposes of life, which is the second proposition I propos’d to explain. When we have found a resemblance among several objects, that often occur to us, we apply the same name to all of them, whatever differences we may observe in the degrees of their quantity and quality, and whatever other differences may appear among them. After we have acquired a custom of this kind, the hearing of that name revives the idea of one of these objects, and makes the imagination conceive it with all its particular circumstances and proportions. But as the same word is suppos’d to have been frequently applied to other individuals, that are different in many respects from that idea, which is immediately present to the mind; the word not being able to revive the idea of all these individuals, only touches the soul, if I may be allow’d so to speak, and revives that custom, which we have acquir’d by surveying them. They are not really and in fact present to the mind, but only in power; nor do we draw them all out distinctly in the imagination, but keep ourselves in a readiness to survey any of them, as we may be prompted by a present design or necessity. The word raises up an individual idea, along with a certain custom; and that custom produces any other individual one, for which we may have occasion. But as the production of all the ideas, to which the name may be apply’d, is in most cases impossible, we abridge that work by a more partial consideration, and find but few inconveniences to arise in our reasoning from that abridgment.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种对观念的应用超越了它们的本质，是由于我们以这样一种不完善的方式收集了它们所有可能的数量和质量程度，以达到生活的目的，这是我提议解释的第二个主张。当我们发现经常出现在我们面前的几个物体之间有相似之处时，我们就对所有这些物体采用相同的名称，不管我们在它们的数量和质量的程度上可能观察到什么差异，也不管它们之间可能出现什么其他差异。在我们养成了这种习惯之后，听到这个名字就会唤起这些物体中的一个概念，并使想象力想象出它的所有特殊情况和比例。但是，由于同一个词被认为经常被用于其他个人，而这些个人在许多方面都与头脑中立即出现的那个想法不同；这个词不能唤起所有这些个人的想法，只是触动了灵魂，如果我可以这样说的话，并恢复了我们通过观察他们而获得的那个习惯。他们并不是真正地、事实上地存在于头脑中，而只是在力量上；我们也没有在想象中把他们全部清楚地画出来，而是在当前的设计或需要的推动下，让自己随时准备调查他们中的任何一个。这个词提出了一个单独的想法，以及一个特定的习俗；而这个习俗产生了任何其他单独的想法，我们可能有机会。但是，由于在大多数情况下不可能产生这个名字可能适用的所有观念，我们通过更片面的考虑来缩减这项工作，并且发现这种缩减在我们的推理中很少有不便之处。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">For this is one of the most extraordinary circumstances in the present affair, that after the mind has produc’d an individual idea, upon which we reason, the attendant custom, reviv’d by the general or abstract term, readily suggests any other individual, if by chance we form any reasoning, that agrees not with it. Thus shou’d we mention the word, triangle, and form the idea of a particular equilateral one to correspond to it, and shou’d we afterwards assert, <i class="calibre10">that the three angles of a triangle are equal to each other</i>, the other individuals of a scalenum and isoceles, which we overlook’d at first, immediately crowd in upon us, and make us perceive the falshood of this proposition, tho’ it be true with relation to that idea, which we had form’d. If the mind suggests not always these ideas upon occasion, it proceeds from some imperfection in its faculties; and such a one as is often the source of false reasoning and sophistry. But this is principally the case with those ideas which are abstruse and compounded. On other occasions the custom is more entire, and ’tis seldom we run into such errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因为这是当前事件中最特殊的情况之一，即在我们的头脑中产生了一个单独的想法，并在此基础上进行推理后，如果我们偶然形成任何与之不一致的推理，那么由一般的或抽象的术语所唤起的相关习惯就会轻易地暗示任何其他个体。因此，如果我们提到三角形这个词，并形成一个特定的等边概念与之对应，如果我们后来断言，<i class="calibre10">三角形的三个角彼此相等</i>，那么我们一开始忽略的标尺和等边的其他个体就会立即拥入我们中间，并使我们意识到这个命题的虚假性，尽管它与我们形成的那个概念有关。如果头脑在某些情况下并不总是暗示这些想法，那是由于其能力中的某些缺陷造成的；这种缺陷往往是错误推理和诡辩的来源。但这主要是指那些深奥的、复合的观念。在其他场合，这种习惯更加完整，我们很少会遇到这种错误。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nay so entire is the custom, that the very same idea may be annext to several different words, and may be employ’d in different reasonings, without any danger of mistake. Thus the idea of an equilateral triangle of an inch perpendicular may serve us in talking of a figure, of a rectilineal figure, of a regular figure, of a triangle, and of an equilateral triangle. All these terms, therefore, are in this case attended with the same idea; but as they are wont to be apply’d in a greater or lesser compass, they excite their particular habits, and thereby keep the mind in a readiness to observe, that no conclusion be form’d contrary to any ideas, which are usually compriz’d under them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">然而，这种习惯是如此的完整，以至于同一个概念可以与几个不同的词相连接，并且可以在不同的推理中使用，而没有任何错误的危险。因此，一英寸垂直的等边三角形的概念可以为我们谈论一个图形、一个直角形、一个规则图形、一个三角形和一个等边三角形服务。因此，在这种情况下，所有这些术语都带有相同的概念；但由于它们通常会在或多或少的范围内被应用，因此它们会激发各自的特殊习惯，从而使人们随时注意，不要形成与任何概念相反的结论，而这些概念通常是由它们组成的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Before those habits have become entirely perfect, perhaps the mind may not be content with forming the idea of only one individual, but may run over several, in order to make itself comprehend its own meaning, and the compass of that collection, which it intends to express by the general term. That we may fix the meaning of the word, figure, we may revolve in our mind the ideas of circles, squares, parallelograms, triangles of different sizes and proportions, and may not rest on one image or idea. However this may be, ’tis certain <i class="calibre10">that</i> we form the idea of individuals, whenever we use any general term; <i class="calibre10">that</i> we seldom or never can exhaust these individuals; and <i class="calibre10">that</i> those, which remain, are only represented by means of that habit, by which we recall them, whenever any present occasion requires it. This then is the nature of our abstract ideas and general terms; and ’tis after this manner we account for the foregoing paradox, <i class="calibre10">that some ideas are particular in their nature, but general in their representation</i>. A particular idea becomes general by being annex’d to a general term; that is, to a term, which from a customary conjunction has a relation to many other particular ideas, and readily recalls them in the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这些习惯变得完全完美之前，也许头脑可能不满足于只形成一个个体的概念，而可能会辗转于几个个体，以便使自己理解它自己的意义，以及它打算用一般术语表达的那个集合的范围。为了确定 “图形” 这个词的含义，我们可以在头脑中旋转不同大小和比例的圆形、方形、平行四边形、三角形的概念，而不是停留在一个图像或概念上。无论如何，可以肯定的<i class="calibre10">是</i> <i class="calibre10">，</i>每当我们使用任何一般的术语时，我们都会形成个体的概念；我们很少或永远无法穷尽这些个体；<i class="calibre10">而</i>那些仍然存在的个体，只是通过这种习惯来表示，每当任何当前的场合需要它时，我们就会想起它们。这就是我们的抽象概念和一般术语的性质；我们就是以这种方式来解释前面的悖论，<i class="calibre10">即一些概念在本质上是特殊的，但在表现上是一般的</i>。一个特殊的想法通过被附在一个一般的术语上而成为一般的；也就是说，附在一个术语上，而这个术语通过习惯性的连接与许多其他特殊的想法有关系，并且很容易在想象中唤起它们。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The only difficulty, that can remain on this subject, must be with regard to that custom, which so readily recalls every particular idea, for which we may have occasion, and is excited by any word or sound, to which we commonly annex it. The most proper method, in my opinion, of giving a satisfactory explication of this act of the mind, is by producing other instances, which are analogous to it, and other principles, which facilitate its operation. To explain the ultimate causes of our mental actions is impossible. ’Tis sufficient, if we can give any satisfactory account of them from experience and analogy.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">First then I observe, that when we mention any great number, such as a thousand, the mind has generally no adequate idea of it, but only a power of producing such an idea, by its adequate idea of the decimals, under which the number is comprehended.

		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, I believe every one, who examines the situation of his mind in reasoning, will agree with me, that we do not annex distinct and compleat ideas to every term we make use of, and that in talking of <i class="calibre10">government, church, negotiation, conquest</i>, we seldom spread out in our minds all the simple ideas, of which these complex ones are compos’d. ’Tis however observable, that notwithstanding this imperfection we may avoid talking nonsense on these subjects, and may perceive any repugnance among the ideas, as well as if we had a full comprehension of them. Thus if instead of saying, <i class="calibre10">that in war the weaker have always recourse to negotiation</i>, we shou’d say, <i class="calibre10">that they have always recourse to conquest</i>, the custom, which we have acquir’d of attributing certain relations to ideas, still follows the words, and makes us immediately perceive the absurdity of that proposition; in the same manner as one particular idea may serve us in reasoning concerning other ideas, however different from it in several circumstances.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，我相信每一个人，只要审视一下自己头脑中的推理情况，都会同意我的看法，即我们并没有把独特和完整的想法附在我们所使用的每一个术语上，在谈论<i class="calibre10">政府、教会、谈判、征服</i>时，我们很少在头脑中展开所有简单的想法，而这些复杂的想法是由这些想法组成的。然而，可以看到的是，尽管有这种缺陷，我们还是可以避免在这些问题上胡说八道，并且可以察觉到这些想法之间的任何矛盾，就像我们对它们有充分理解一样。因此，如果我们不说<i class="calibre10">在战争中弱者总是求助</i>于谈判，而是说<i class="calibre10">他们总是求助</i>于征服，那么，我们所掌握的将某些关系归于观念的习惯，仍然跟随着话语，并使我们立即察觉到这个命题的荒谬性；同样，一个特定的观念可以帮助我们推理其他的观念，尽管在一些情况下与它不同。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Fourthly, As the individuals are collected together, and plac’d under a general term with a view to that resemblance, which they bear to each other, this relation must facilitate their entrance in the imagination, and make them be suggested more readily upon occasion. And indeed if we consider the common progress of the thought, either in reflexion or conversation, we shall find great reason to be satisfy’d in this particular. Nothing is more admirable, than the readiness, with which the imagination suggests its ideas, and presents them at the very instant, in which they become necessary or useful. The fancy runs from one end of the universe to the other in collecting those ideas, which belong to any subject. One would think the whole intellectual world of ideas was at once subjected to our view, and that we did nothing but pick out such as were most proper for our purpose. There may not, however, be any present, beside those very ideas, that are thus collected by a kind of magical faculty in the soul, which, tho’ it be always most perfect in the greatest geniuses, and is properly what we call a genius, is however inexplicable by the utmost efforts of human understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第四，由于这些个体被收集在一起，并被置于一个总的术语之下，以考虑到它们彼此之间的相似性，这种关系一定会促进它们进入想象力，并使它们在某些情况下更容易被提出。事实上，如果我们考虑到思想的普遍进展，无论是在反思还是在交谈中，我们都会发现有很大的理由在这个方面感到满意。没有什么比想象力能随时提出它的想法，并在它们变得必要或有用的时候提出它们更令人钦佩的了。想象力从宇宙的一端跑到另一端，收集那些属于任何主题的想法。人们会认为，整个思想世界都在我们的视线范围内，而我们除了挑选出最适合我们目的的思想外，什么都没做。然而，除了这些想法之外，可能没有任何想法是由灵魂中的一种神奇的能力所收集的，虽然这种能力在最伟大的天才身上总是最完美的，而且是我们所称的天才，但人类理解力的最大努力却无法解释。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Perhaps these four reflexions may help to remove all difficulties to the hypothesis I have propos’d concerning abstract ideas, so contrary to that, which has hitherto prevail’d in philosophy. But to tell the truth I place my chief confidence in what I have already prov’d concerning the impossibility of general ideas, according to the common method of explaining them. We must certainly seek some new system on this head, and there plainly is none beside what I have propos’d. If ideas be particular in their nature, and at the same time finite in their number, ’tis only by custom they can become general in their representation, and contain an infinite number of other ideas under them.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">也许这四个反思可以帮助消除我提出的关于抽象观念的假设的所有困难，因为它与迄今为止在哲学中占主导地位的假设相反。但说实话，我对我已经证明的关于一般观念的不可能性的东西，按照解释它们的普通方法，抱有主要的信心。我们当然必须在这个问题上寻求一些新的体系，而除了我所提出的建议之外，显然没有其他的体系。如果观念在本质上是特殊的，同时在数量上又是有限的，那么只有通过习惯，它们才能在表述上成为一般性的，并在它们之下包含无限的其他观念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Before I leave this subject I shall employ the same principles to explain that <i class="calibre10">distinction of reason</i>, which is so much talk’d of, and is so little understood, in the schools. Of this kind is the distinction betwixt figure and the body figur’d; motion and the body mov’d. The difficulty of explaining this distinction arises from the principle above explain’d, <i class="calibre10">that all ideas, which are different, are separable</i>. For it follows from thence, that if the figure be different from the body, their ideas must be separable as well as distinguishable; if they be not different, their ideas can neither be separable nor distinguishable. What then is meant by a distinction of reason, since it implies neither a difference nor separation?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我离开这个话题之前，我将用同样的原则来解释<i class="calibre10">理性的区别</i>，这种区别在学校里被谈论得很多，但却很少被理解。这类区别是图形和图形的身体之间的区别；运动和运动的身体之间的区别。解释这种区别的困难来自于上面解释的原则，<i class="calibre10">即所有不同的概念都是可以分离的</i>。因为由此可见，如果图形与身体不同，它们的观念必须是可分离的，也是可区分的；如果它们不不同，它们的观念既不可能是可分离的也不可能是可区分的。那么，既然理性的区别既不意味着差异，也不意味着分离，那么它是什么意思呢？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To remove this difficulty we must have recourse to the foregoing explication of abstract ideas. ’Tis certain that the mind wou’d never have dream’d of distinguishing a figure from the body figur’d, as being in reality neither distinguishable, nor different, nor separable; did it not observe, that even in this simplicity there might be contain’d many different resemblances and relations. Thus when a globe of white marble is presented, we receive only the impression of a white colour dispos’d in a certain form, nor are we able to separate and distinguish the colour from the form. But observing afterwards a globe of black marble and a cube of white, and comparing them with our former object, we find two separate resemblances, in what formerly seem’d, and really is, perfectly inseparable. After a little more practice of this kind, we begin to distinguish the figure from the colour by a <i class="calibre10">distinction of reason</i>; that is, we consider the figure and colour together, since they are in effect the same and undistinguishable; but still view them in different aspects, according to the resemblances, of which they are susceptible. When we wou’d consider only the figure of the globe of white marble, we form in reality an idea both of the figure and colour, but tacitly carry our eye to its resemblance with the globe of black marble: And in the same manner, when we wou’d consider its colour only, we turn our view to its resemblance with the cube of white marble. By this means we accompany our ideas with a kind of reflexion, of which custom renders us, in a great measure, insensible. A person, who desires us to consider the figure of a globe of white marble without thinking on its colour, desires an impossibility; but his meaning is, that we shou’d consider the colour and figure together, but still keep in our eye the resemblance to the globe of black marble, or that to any other globe of whatever colour or substance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了消除这一困难，我们必须求助于前面对抽象概念的解释。可以肯定的是，人们从来没有想过要把一个图形与所描绘的身体区分开来，因为它实际上既不能区分，也没有不同，更不能分离；如果它不观察，即使在这种简单的情况下，也可能包含许多不同的相似性和关系。因此，当一个白色的大理石球呈现在我们面前时，我们只收到了白色的颜色以某种形式出现的印象，我们也无法将颜色与形式分开并加以区分。但随后观察一个黑色大理石球和一个白色立方体，并将它们与我们以前的物体进行比较，我们发现在以前看起来，实际上是完全不可分割的东西中，有两个独立的相似之处。再经过这样的实践，我们开始通过<i class="calibre10">理性的</i>区分来区分图形和颜色；也就是说，我们把图形和颜色放在一起考虑，因为它们实际上是一样的，无法区分；但仍然根据它们的相似性，从不同的方面来看待它们，因为它们容易受到影响。当我们只考虑白色大理石球的形状时，我们实际上对形状和颜色都形成了一个概念，但却默默地把我们的目光带到了它与黑色大理石球的相似之处。同样地，当我们只考虑它的颜色时，我们的视线会转向它与白色大理石立方体的相似性。通过这种方式，我们用一种反思来伴随我们的想法，而习惯使我们在很大程度上不了解这种反思。有人希望我们考虑白色大理石球的形状而不考虑它的颜色，这是不可能的；但他的意思是，我们应该把颜色和形状放在一起考虑，但仍要注意与黑色大理石球的相似性，或与任何其他颜色或物质的球的相似性。</p></div>

From these dispositions in philosophers and their disciples arises that mutual complaisance betwixt them; while the former furnish such plenty of strange and unaccountable opinions, and the latter so readily believe them.

		<p class="block_6 en">We may hence discover the error of the common opinion, that the capacity of the mind is limited on both sides, and that 'tis impossible for the imagination to form an adequate idea, of what goes beyond a certain degree of minuteness as well as of greatness. Nothing can be more minute, than some ideas, which we form in the fancy; and images, which appear to the senses; since there are ideas and images perfectly simple and indivisible. The only defect of our senses is, that they give us disproportion'd images of things, and represent as minute and uncompounded what is really great and compos'd of a vast number of parts. This mistake we are not sensible of; but taking the impressions of those minute objects, which appear to the senses, to be equal or nearly equal to the objects, and finding by reason, that there are other objects vastly more minute, we too hastily conclude, that these are inferior to any idea of our imagination or impression of our senses. This however is certain, that we can form ideas, which shall be no greater than the smallest atom of the animal spirits of an insect a thousand times less than a mite: And we ought rather to conclude, that the difficulty lies in enlarging our conceptions so much as to form a just notion of a mite, or even of an insect a thousand times less than a mite. For in order to form a just notion of these animals, we must have a distinct idea representing every part of them; which, according to the system of infinite divisibility, is utterly impossible, and according to that of indivisible parts or atoms, is extremely difficult, by reason of the vast number and multiplicity of these parts.</p>

'Tis therefore utterly absurd to suppose any number to exist, and yet deny the existence of unites; and as extension is always a number, according to the common sentiment of metaphysicians, and never resolves itself into any unite or indivisible quantity, it follows, that extension can never at all exist. 'Tis in vain to reply, that any determinate quantity of extension is an unite; but such-a-one as admits of an infinite number of fractions, and is inexhaustible in its sub-divisions. For by the same rule these twenty men <i class="calibre10">may be consider'd as an unite</i>.

'Tis a property inseparable from time, and which in a manner constitutes its essence, that each of its parts succeeds another, and that none of them, however contiguous, can ever be co-existent. For the same reason, that, the year 1737 cannot concur with the present year 1738, every moment must be distinct from, and posterior or antecedent to another. 'Tis certain then, that time, as it exists, must be compos'd of indivisible moments. For if in time we could never arrive at an end of division, and if each moment, as it succeeds another, were not perfectly single and indivisible, there would be an infinite number of coexistent moments, or parts of time; which I believe will be allow'd to be an arrant contradiction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">正如我们从可见的和有形的物体的排列中得到空间的概念一样，我们也从观念和印象的连续中形成了时间的概念，也不可能只有时间才出现，或被心灵所注意。一个人在酣睡中，或被一种思想强烈地占据着，对时间是无动于衷的；根据他的感知以更大或更小的速度相互延续，同样的时间在他的想象中显得更长或更短。一位伟大的哲学家曾说过 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-128" id="calibre_link-362" title="7">7</a></sup>一位伟大的哲学家说，我们的感知在这方面有一定的界限，这是由心灵的原始性质和结构决定的，超过这个界限，外部物体对感官的影响就永远无法加速或延缓我们的思维。如果你快速地转动一块燃烧的煤，它就会在感官上呈现出一圈火的形象；在它的旋转之间似乎也没有任何时间间隔；这主要是因为我们的感知不可能以同样的速度相互延续，从而使运动传达给外部物体。只要我们没有连续的知觉，我们就没有时间的概念，即使物体中存在着真正的连续。从这些现象以及其他许多现象中，我们可以得出这样的结论：时间不可能单独出现在人们的头脑中，也不可能伴随着一个稳定的、不可改变的物体，而总是通过一些<i class="calibre10">可感知</i>的、可改变的物体的连续来发现的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this we may add the following argument, which to me seems perfectly decisive and convincing. 'Tis evident, that time or duration consists of different parts: For otherwise we cou'd not conceive a longer or shorter duration. 'Tis also evident, that these parts are not co-existent: For that quality of the co-existence of parts belongs to extension, and is what distinguishes it from duration. Now as time is compos'd of parts, that are not co-existent; an unchangeable object, since it produces none but co-existent impressions, produces none that can give us the idea of time; and consequently that idea must be deriv'd from a succession of changeable objects, and time in its first appearance can never be sever'd from such a succession.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证实这一点，我们可以补充以下论点，在我看来，它是完全决定性和令人信服的。很明显，时间或持续时间由不同的部分组成。因为否则我们就无法想象出更长或更短的时间。同样明显的是，这些部分并不同时存在。因为各部分共存的特性属于延伸，也是它与持续时间的区别所在。现在，由于时间是由不共存的部分组成的；一个不可改变的物体，由于它除了产生共存的印象外，不产生任何能给我们带来时间概念的东西；因此，这种概念必须从可改变的物体的连续中衍生出来，而时间在其最初出现时永远不可能从这种连续中分离。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Having therefore found, that time in its first appearance to the mind is always conjoin'd with a succession of changeable objects, and that otherwise it can never fall under our notice, we must now examine whether it can be <i class="calibre10">conceiv'd</i> without our conceiving any succession of objects, and whether it can alone form a distinct idea in the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们发现，时间在最初出现在头脑中时，总是与一连串可变化的物体联系在一起，否则它永远不会被我们注意到，我们现在必须研究它是否可以在我们不设想任何一连串物体的情况下被<i class="calibre10">设想</i>出来，以及它是否可以单独在想象中形成一个独特的概念。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to know whether any objects, which are join'd in impression, be separable in idea, we need only consider, if they be different from each other; in which case, 'tis plain they may be conceiv'd apart. Every thing, that is different, is distinguishable; and every thing, that is distinguishable, may be separated, according to the maxims above-explain'd. If on the contrary they be not different, they are not distinguishable; and if they be not distinguishable, they cannot be separated. But this is precisely the case with respect to time, compar'd with our successive perceptions. The idea of time is not deriv'd from a particular impression mix'd up with others, and plainly distinguishable from them; but arises altogether from the manner, in which impressions appear to the mind, without making one of the number. Five notes play'd on a flute give us the impression and idea of time; tho' time be not a sixth impression, which presents itself to the hearing or any other of the senses. Nor is it a sixth impression, which the mind by reflection finds in itself. These five sounds making their appearance in this particular manner, excite no emotion in the mind, nor produce an affection of any kind, which being observ'd by it can give rise to a new idea. For <i class="calibre10">that</i> is necessary to produce a new idea of reflection, nor can the mind, by revolving over a thousand times all its ideas of sensation, ever extract from them any new original idea, unless nature has so fram'd its faculties, that it feels some new original impression arise from such a contemplation. But here it only takes notice of the <i class="calibre10">manner</i>, in which the different sounds make their appearance; and that it may afterwards consider without considering these particular sounds, but may conjoin it with any other objects. The ideas of some objects it certainly must have, nor is it possible for it without these ideas ever to arrive at any conception of time; which since it appears not as any primary distinct impression, can plainly be nothing but different ideas, or impressions, or objects dispos'd in a certain manner, that is, succeeding each other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了了解在印象中结合在一起的任何物体在观念中是否可以分开，我们只需要考虑它们是否彼此不同；在这种情况下，很明显它们可以被设想为分开。每一个不同的事物都是可以区分的；而每一个可以区分的事物都可以根据上面所解释的格言而被分开。相反，如果它们没有区别，它们就不能被区分；如果它们不能被区分，它们就不能被分开。但是，就时间而言，与我们的连续感知相比，情况恰恰是这样。时间的概念不是从一个与其他印象混合在一起的特定印象中衍生出来的，也不是从这些印象中明显可以区分出来的；而是完全来自于印象出现在头脑中的方式，而不是数量上的一个。笛子上的五个音符给了我们时间的印象和概念；尽管时间不是呈现在听觉或任何其他感官上的第六个印象。它也不是头脑通过思考在自身中找到的第六种印象。这五种声音以这种特殊的方式出现，并没有在头脑中激起任何情绪，也没有产生任何一种感情，而这种感情被它观察到就会产生一种新的观念。因为要产生一个新的反思观念，必须要有<i class="calibre10">一个</i>新的想法，除非自然界已经把它的能力框住了，使它觉得从这种思考中产生了一些新的原始印象，否则，心灵通过千百次地旋转它所有的感觉观念，也不可能从它们中提取任何新的原始观念。但在这里，它只注意到不同的声音出现的<i class="calibre10">方式</i>；而且，它以后可以不考虑这些特定的声音，而是把它与任何其他物体联系起来。它当然必须有一些对象的观念，如果没有这些观念，它也不可能得出任何时间的概念；既然它不是作为任何主要的独特印象出现的，那么它显然只能是不同的观念，或印象，或以某种方式处置的对象，也就是说，彼此相继。</p></div>

For it inevitably follows from thence, that since the idea of duration cannot be deriv'd from such an object, it can never in any propriety or exactness be apply'd to it, nor can any thing unchangeable be ever said to have duration. Ideas always represent the objects or impressions, from which they are deriv'd, and can never without a fiction represent or be apply'd to any other.

		<p class="block_6 en">Our system concerning space and time consists of two parts, which are intimately connected together. The first depends on this chain of reasoning. The capacity of the mind is not infinite; consequently no idea of extension or duration consists of an infinite number of parts or inferior ideas, but of a finite number, and these simple and indivisible: 'Tis therefore possible for space and time to exist conformable to this idea: And if it be possible, 'tis certain they actually do exist conformable to it; since their infinite divisibility is utterly impossible and contradictory.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们关于空间和时间的系统由两部分组成，它们紧密地联系在一起。第一部分取决于这个推理链。心灵的能力不是无限的；因此，任何关于延伸或持续时间的观念都不是由无限多的部分或低级观念组成的，而是由有限的数量组成的，而且这些部分是简单的、不可分割的：因此，空间和时间有可能按照这种观念而存在。如果它是可能的，那么可以肯定的是，它们确实是按照这个理念存在的；因为它们的无限可分性是完全不可能和矛盾的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The other part of our system is a consequence of this. The parts, into which the ideas of space and time resolve themselves, become at last indivisible; and these indivisible parts, being nothing in themselves, are inconceivable when not fill'd with something real and existent. The ideas of space and time are therefore no separate or distinct ideas, but merely those of the manner or order, in which objects exist: Or, in other words, 'tis impossible to conceive either a vacuum and extension without matter, or a time, when there was no succession or change in any real existence. The intimate connexion betwixt these parts of our system is the reason why we shall examine together the objections, which have been urg'd against both of them, beginning with those against the finite divisibility of extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们系统的另一部分是这个的结果。空间和时间的观念所形成的部分，最终成为不可分割的部分；而这些不可分割的部分，本身并没有什么，如果不以真实存在的东西来填充，就无法想象。因此，空间和时间的观念不是单独的或不同的观念，而只是物体存在的方式或秩序的观念。或者，换句话说，"不可能想象没有物质的真空和延伸，也不可能想象没有任何实际存在的连续或变化的时间。我们的体系中的这些部分之间的密切联系，就是我们为什么要把反对这两个部分的反对意见放在一起研究的原因，首先是反对扩展的有限可分性的意见。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I. The first of these objections, which I shall take notice of, is more proper to prove this connexion and dependence of the one part upon the other, than to destroy either of them. It has often been maintain'd in the schools, that extension must be divisible, <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>, because the system of mathematical points is absurd; and that system is absurd, because a mathematical point is a non-entity, and consequently can never by its conjunction with others form a real existence. This wou'd be perfectly decisive, were there no medium betwixt the infinite divisibility of matter, and the non-entity of mathematical points. But there is evidently a medium, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the bestowing a colour or solidity on these points; and the absurdity of both the extremes is a demonstration of the truth and reality of this medium. The system of <i class="calibre10">physical</i> points, which is another medium, is too absurd to need a refutation. A real extension, such as a physical point is suppos'd to be, can never exist without parts, different from each other; and wherever objects are different, they are distinguishable and separable by the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">I·我将注意到这些反对意见中的第一个，它更适合于证明这一部分对另一部分的联系和依赖，而不是破坏其中任何一部分。学校里经常有人主张，扩展必须是可分的，而且是<i class="calibre10">无限的</i>，因为数学点的系统是荒谬的；而这个系统是荒谬的，因为数学点是一个非实体，因此永远不可能通过与其他点的结合形成一个真正的存在。如果在物质的无限可分性和数学点的非实体性之间没有媒介，这将是完全决定性的。但显然存在一种媒介，<i class="calibre10">即</i>赋予这些点以颜色或实体性；两个极端的荒谬性都证明了这种媒介的真实性和现实性。<i class="calibre10">物理</i>点的系统，是另一种媒介，太荒谬了，不需要反驳。一个真正的延伸，如物理点被认为是，永远不可能没有彼此不同的部分而存在；凡是物体不同的地方，它们都可以通过想象力加以区分和分离。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">II. The second objection is deriv'd from the necessity there wou'd be of <i class="calibre10">penetration</i>, if extension consisted of mathematical points. A simple and indivisible atom, that touches another, must necessarily penetrate it; for 'tis impossible it can touch it by its external parts, from the very supposition of its perfect simplicity, which excludes all parts. It must therefore touch it intimately, and in its whole essence, <i class="calibre10">secundum se, tota, &amp; totaliter</i>; which is the very definition of penetration. But penetration is impossible: Mathematical points are of consequence equally impossible.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">II·第二种反对意见来自于<i class="calibre10">穿透</i>的必要性，如果延伸是由数学点组成的话。一个简单的、不可分割的原子，如果接触到另一个原子，就必须穿透它；因为它不可能通过它的外部部分来接触它，因为它的完美的简单性的假设本身就排除了所有的部分。因此，它必须密切地接触它，并在其整个本质上接触它，从<i class="calibre10">本质上、从整体上和从整体</i>上；这正是渗透的定义。但穿透是不可能的。因此，数学上的点也同样不可能。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I answer this objection by substituting a juster idea of penetration. Suppose two bodies containing no void within their circumference, to approach each other, and to unite in such a manner that the body, which results from their union, is no more extended than either of them; 'tis this we must mean when we talk of penetration. But 'tis evident this penetration is nothing but the annihilation of one of these bodies, and the preservation of the other, without our being able to distinguish particularly which is preserv'd and which annihilated. Before the approach we have the idea of two bodies. After it we have the idea only of one. 'Tis impossible for the mind to preserve any notion of difference betwixt two bodies of the same nature existing in the same place at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我用一个更公正的穿透力概念来回答这个反对意见。假设两个周身没有空隙的物体相互接近，并以这样的方式结合，即由它们的结合所产生的物体不比它们中的任何一个更扩展；当我们谈论穿透力时，这就是我们必须指的。但很明显，这种渗透只不过是其中一个体的湮灭和另一个体的保留，而我们却无法特别区分哪个体被保留，哪个体被湮灭。在接近之前，我们有两个身体的概念。在它之后，我们只有一个概念。心灵不可能在同一时间、同一地点、同一性质的两个身体之间保留任何差异的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Taking then penetration in this sense, for the annihilation of one body upon its approach to another, I ask any one, if he sees a necessity, that a colour'd or tangible point shou'd be annihilated upon the approach of another colour'd or tangible point? On the contrary, does he not evidently perceive, that from the union of these points there results an object, which is compounded and divisible, and may be distinguish'd into two parts, of which each preserves its existence distinct and separate, notwithstanding its contiguity to the other? Let him aid his fancy by conceiving these points to be of different colours, the better to prevent their coalition and confusion. A blue and a red point may surely lie contiguous without any penetration or annihilation. For if they cannot, what possibly can become of them? Whether shall the red or the blue be annihilated? Or if these colours unite into one, what new colour will they produce by their union?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，在这个意义上，对于一个物体在接近另一个物体时的消灭，我问任何人，他是否认为一个有颜色或有形的点在接近另一个有颜色或有形的点时必须消灭？相反，难道他没有明显地意识到，从这些点的结合中产生了一个物体，这个物体是复合的、可分割的，并且可以区分为两个部分，其中每个部分都保持其独特和独立的存在，尽管它与另一个部分相邻？让他帮助他的想象力，把这些点设想成不同的颜色，以更好地防止它们的结合和混淆。一个蓝色的点和一个红色的点肯定可以相邻而不互相渗透或消灭。因为如果它们不能，它们会变成什么呢？红色或蓝色是否会被消灭？或者，如果这些颜色合二为一，它们的结合会产生什么新的颜色？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">What chiefly gives rise to these objections, and at the same time renders it so difficult to give a satisfactory answer to them, is the natural infirmity and unsteadiness both of our imagination and senses, when employ'd on such minute objects. Put a spot of ink upon paper, and retire to such a distance, that the spot becomes altogether invisible; you will find, that upon your return and nearer approach the spot first becomes visible by short intervals; and afterwards becomes always visible; and afterwards acquires only a new force in its colouring without augmenting its bulk; and afterwards, when it has encreas'd to such a degree as to be really extended, 'tis still difficult for the imagination to break it into its component parts, because of the uneasiness it finds in the conception of such a minute object as a single point. This infirmity affects most of our reasonings on the present subject, and makes it almost impossible to answer in an intelligible manner, and in proper expressions, many questions which may arise concerning it.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">引起这些反对意见的主要原因，同时也使我们很难对这些反对意见作出令人满意的回答，那就是我们的想象力和感官在对这种细微的物体进行研究时，自然会有缺陷和不稳定的感觉。把一个墨点放在纸上，然后退到很远的地方，使这个墨点完全看不见；你会发现，当你回来和靠近时，这个墨点先是在很短的间隔内变得可见；然后变得始终可见；然后在它的颜色中只获得一种新的力量，而不增加它的体积。而后，当它增大到如此程度，以至于真正的扩展，想象力仍然难以将它分解成其组成部分，因为它在将如此微小的物体想象成一个单一的点时感到不安。这种缺陷影响了我们对这个问题的大部分推理，并使我们几乎不可能以一种可理解的方式和适当的表达方式来回答许多可能出现的有关问题。</p></div>

But tho' its decisions concerning these proportions be sometimes infallible, they are not always so; nor are our judgments of this kind more exempt from doubt and error, than those on any other subject.

Nor is this the only correction, which these judgments of our senses undergo; but we often discover our error by a juxta-position of the objects; or where that is impracticable, by the use of some common and invariable measure, which being successively apply'd to each, informs us of their different proportions.

But we are not content with this. For as sound reason convinces us that there are bodies <i class="calibre10">vastly</i> more minute than those, which appear to the senses; and as a false reason wou'd perswade us, that there are bodies <i class="calibre10">infinitely</i> more minute; we clearly perceive, that we are not possess'd of any instrument or art of measuring, which can secure us from all error and uncertainty. We are sensible, that the addition or removal of one of these minute parts, is not discernible either in the appearance or measuring; and 'as we imagine, that two figures, which were equal before, cannot be equal after this removal or addition, we therefore suppose some imaginary standard of equality, by which the appearances and measuring are exactly corrected, and the figures reduc'd entirely to that proportion. This standard is plainly imaginary. For as the very idea of equality is that of such a particular appearance corrected by juxta-position or a common measure, the notion of any correction beyond what we have instruments and art to make, is a mere fiction of the mind, and useless as well as incomprehensible. But tho' this standard be only imaginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor is any thing more usual, than for the mind to proceed after this manner with any action, even after the reason has ceas'd, which first determin'd it to begin. This appears very conspicuously with regard to time; where tho' 'tis evident we have no exact method of determining the proportions of parts, not even so exact as in extension, yet the various corrections of our measures, and their different degrees of exactness, have given us an obscure and implicit notion of a perfect and entire equality. The case is the same in many other subjects.

		<p class="block_6 en">It appears, then, that the ideas which are most essential to geometry, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> those of equality and inequality, of a right line and a plain surface, are far from being exact and determinate, according to our common method of conceiving them. Not only we are incapable of telling, if the case be in any degree doubtful, when such particular figures are equal; when such a line is a right one, and such a surface a plain one; but we can form no idea of that proportion, or of these figures, which is firm and invariable. Our appeal is still to the weak and fallible judgment, which we make from the appearance of the objects, and correct by a compass or common measure; and if we join the supposition of any farther correction, 'tis of such-a-one as is either useless or imaginary. In vain shou'd we have recourse to the common topic, and employ the supposition of a deity, whose omnipotence may enable him to form a perfect geometrical figure, and describe a right line without any curve or inflexion. As the ultimate standard of these figures is deriv'd from nothing but the senses and imagination, 'tis absurd to talk of any perfection beyond what these faculties can judge of; since the true perfection of any thing consists in its conformity to its standard.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这样看来，对几何学最重要的概念，<i class="calibre10">即</i>平等和不平等、直线和平面的概念，按照我们常用的概念方法，远不是精确和确定的。如果情况有任何疑问，我们不仅无法判断这些特定的数字何时相等；何时这样的线是正确的，何时这样的面是平坦的；而且我们也无法对这种比例或这些数字形成坚定和不变的概念。我们的诉求仍然是脆弱和易变的判断，我们根据物体的外观做出判断，并通过罗盘或普通的测量方法进行修正；如果我们加入任何进一步修正的假设，那也是一种无用或想象的修正。我们徒劳地求助于普通话题，并采用一个神灵的假设，他的全能可能使他形成一个完美的几何图形，并描述一条没有任何曲线或拐点的直线。由于这些图形的最终标准只来自感官和想象力，所以谈论任何超越这些能力所能判断的完美是荒谬的；因为任何事物的真正完美都在于它符合其标准。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now since these ideas are so loose and uncertain, I wou'd fain ask any mathematician what infallible assurance he has, not only of the more intricate and obscure propositions of his science, but of the most vulgar and obvious principles? How can he prove to me, for instance, that two right lines cannot have one common segment? Or that 'tis impossible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points? Shou'd he tell me, that these opinions are obviously absurd, and repugnant to our clear ideas; I wou'd answer, that I do not deny, where two right lines incline upon each other with a sensible angle, but 'tis absurd to imagine them to have a common segment. But supposing these two lines to approach at the rate of an inch in twenty leagues, I perceive no absurdity in asserting, that upon their contact they become one. For, I beseech you, by what rule or standard do you judge, when you assert, that the line, in which I have suppos'd them to concur, cannot make the same right line with those two, that form so small an angle betwixt them? You must surely have some idea of a right line, to which this line does not agree. Do you therefore mean, that it takes not the points in the same order and by the same rule. as is peculiar and essential to a right line? If so, I must inform you, that besides that in judging after this manner you allow, that extension is compos'd of indivisible points (which, perhaps, is more than you intend) besides this, I say, I must inform you, that neither is this the standard from which we form the idea of a right line; nor, if it were, is there any such firmness in our senses or imagination, as to determine when such an order is violated or preserv'd. The original standard of a right line is in reality nothing but a certain general appearance; and 'tis evident right lines may be made to concur with each other, and yet correspond to this standard, tho' corrected by all the means either practicable or imaginable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">既然这些想法是如此松散和不确定，我想问问任何一个数学家，他不仅对他的科学中更复杂和晦涩的命题，而且对最庸俗和明显的原则有什么可靠的保证？例如，他怎么能向我证明，两条直线不可能有一个共同的线段？或者说，在任何两点之间不可能画出一条以上的直线？如果他告诉我，这些观点显然是荒谬的，与我们清晰的想法相抵触；我会回答说，我不否认，两条直线以一个合理的角度相互倾斜，但想象它们有一个共同的线段是荒谬的。但是，假设这两条线以每二十里格一英寸的速度接近，我认为断言它们一接触就成为一体并不荒唐。因为，我请问你，当你断言我所假设的那条线与这两条之间形成如此小角度的线不能成为同一条直线时，你是根据什么规则或标准来判断的？你肯定有一些关于直线的想法，而这条直线与之不一致。因此，你的意思是说，它没有按照直线所特有的、必不可少的顺序和规则取走各点吗？如果是这样，我必须告诉你，除了按照这种方式判断，你允许延伸是由不可分割的点组成的（这也许比你的意图更多）之外，我说，我必须告诉你，这也不是我们形成正线概念的标准；而且，如果它是，在我们的感官或想象力中也没有这样的坚定性，以确定这种秩序何时被违反或保持。正确线条的原始标准实际上不过是某种一般的外观；很明显，正确的线条可能会彼此一致，但却符合这一标准，尽管通过所有可行或可想象的手段进行纠正。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This may open our eyes a little, and let us see, that no geometrical demonstration for the infinite divisibility of extension can have so much force as what we naturally attribute to every argument, which is supported by such magnificent pretensions. At the same time we may learn the reason, why geometry fails of evidence in this single point, while all its other reasonings command our fullest assent and approbation. And indeed it seems more requisite to give the reason of this exception, than to shew, that we really must make such an exception, and regard all the mathematical arguments for infinite divisibility as utterly sophistical. For 'tis evident, that as no idea of quantity is infinitely divisible, there cannot be imagin'd a more glaring absurdity, than to endeavour to prove, that quantity itself admits of such a division; and to prove this by means of ideas, which are directly opposite in that particular.

This I am satisfy'd with, and am willing to rest the controversy merely upon these ideas. I desire therefore our mathematician to form, as accurately as possible, the ideas of a circle and a right line; and I then ask, if upon the conception of their contact he can conceive them as touching in a mathematical point, or if he must necessarily imagine them to concur for some space. Whichever side he chuses, he runs himself into equal difficulties. If he affirms, that in tracing these figures in his imagination, he can imagine them to touch only in a point, he allows the possibility of that idea, and consequently of the thing. If he says, that in his conception of the contact of those lines he must make them concur, he thereby acknowledges the fallacy of geometrical demonstrations, when carry'd beyond a certain degree of minuteness; since 'tis certain he has such demonstrations against the concurrence of a circle and a right line; that is, in other words, he can prove an idea, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that of concurrence, to be <i class="calibre10">incompatible</i> with two other ideas, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> those of a circle and right line; tho' at the same time he acknowledges these ideas to be <i class="calibre10">inseparable</i>.</p>

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我的体系的第二部分是真实的，<i class="calibre10">即空间或延伸的概念只不过是按一定顺序分布的可见或有形的点的概念</i>；那么，我们就不能形成真空或空间的概念，在那里没有任何可见或有形的东西，这就引起了三个反对意见，我将把它们放在一起研究，因为我对一个问题的回答是我对其他问题的回答的结果。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, It may be said, that men have disputed for many ages concerning a vacuum and a plenum, without being able to bring the affair to a final decision; and philosophers, even at this day, think themselves at liberty to take party on either side, as their fancy leads them. But whatever foundation there may be for a controversy concerning the things themselves, it may be pretended, that the very dispute is decisive concerning the idea, and that 'tis impossible men cou'd so long reason about a vacuum, and either refute or defend it, without having a notion of what they refuted or defended.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们可以说，人们对真空和全能的争论已经持续了很多年，但却无法对这件事做出最终的决定；哲学家们，甚至到了今天，还认为自己可以随心所欲地站在任何一方，任凭他们的想象力引导。但是，不管关于事物本身的争论有什么依据，都可以说，这种争论本身就是关于思想的决定性因素，人们不可能对真空进行如此长时间的推理，要么反驳，要么辩护，而对他们反驳或辩护的内容却一无所知。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, If this argument shou'd be contested, the reality or at least possibility of <i class="calibre10">idea</i> of a vacuum may be prov'd by the following reasoning. Every idea is possible, which is a necessary and infallible consequence of such as are possible. Now tho' we allow the world to be at present a plenum, we may easily conceive it to be depriv'd of motion; and this idea will certainly be allow'd possible. It must also be allow'd possible, to conceive the annihilation of any part of matter by the omnipotence of the deity, while the other parts remain at rest. For as every idea, that is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination; and as every idea, that is separable by the imagination, may be conceiv'd to be separately existent; 'tis evident, that the existence of one particle of matter, no more implies the existence of another, than a square figure in one body implies a square figure in every one. This being granted, I now demand what results from the commence of these two possible ideas of <i class="calibre10">rest</i> and <i class="calibre10">annihilation</i>, and what must we conceive to follow upon the annihilation of all the air and subtile matter in the chamber, supposing the walls to remain the same, without any motion or alteration? There are some metaphysicians, who answer, that since matter and extension are the same, the annihilation of one necessarily implies that of the other; and there being now no distance betwixt the walls of the chamber, they touch each other; in the same manner as my hand touches the paper, which is immediately before me. But tho' this answer be very common, I defy these metaphysicians to conceive the matter according to their hypothesis, or imagine the floor and root, with all the opposite sides of the chamber, to touch each other, while they continue in rest, and preserve the same position. For how can the two walls, that run from south to north, touch each other, while they touch the opposite ends of two walls, that run from east to west? And how can the door and roof ever meet, while they are separated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary position? If you change their position, you suppose a motion. If you conceive any thing betwixt them, you suppose a new creation. But keeping strictly to the two ideas of <i class="calibre10">rest</i> and <i class="calibre10">annihilation</i>, 'tis evident, that the idea, which results from them, is not that of a contact of parts, but something else; which is concluded to be the idea of a vacuum.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，如果这个论点受到质疑，那么真空<i class="calibre10">概念</i>的真实性或至少是可能性可以通过以下推理来证明。每个想法都是可能的，这是可能的想法的一个必然的和无懈可击的结果。现在，尽管我们允许世界目前是一个整体，但我们可以很容易地设想它被剥夺了运动；而这个想法肯定会被允许是可能的。也必须允许我们设想，在其他部分保持静止的情况下，物质的任何部分被神的全能所消灭。因为每一个可以区分的概念都是可以通过想象力分离的；而每一个可以通过想象力分离的概念都可以被设想为单独存在；很明显，一个物质颗粒的存在并不意味着另一个颗粒的存在，就像一个身体中的方形图形意味着每个身体中的方形图形一样。既然承认了这一点，我现在要问的是，从<i class="calibre10">静止</i>和<i class="calibre10">湮灭</i>这两个可能的概念开始，我们必须设想，假设墙壁保持不变，没有任何运动或改变，那么室内所有的空气和微观物质的湮灭会带来什么结果？有一些形而上学者回答说，既然物质和延伸是相同的，那么一个的消灭必然意味着另一个的消灭；现在室壁之间没有距离，它们相互接触；就像我的手接触到我面前的纸一样。虽然这个答案很普通，但我不相信这些形而上学者会按照他们的假设来构思这个问题，或者想象地板和树根，以及房间的所有对面，会互相接触，而它们继续处于静止状态，并保持同样的位置。因为从南到北的两面墙怎么可能相互接触，而它们却接触到从东到西的两面墙的两端？门和屋顶怎么可能相遇，而它们却被四面墙分开，处于相反的位置？如果你改变了它们的位置，你就认为是一种运动。如果你在它们之间构想出任何东西，你就认为是一种新的创造。但是，严格按照<i class="calibre10">静止</i>和<i class="calibre10">湮灭</i>这两个概念，很明显，由它们产生的概念不是各部分的接触，而是其他东西；这被断定为真空的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The third objection carries the matter still farther, and not only asserts, that the idea of a vacuum is real and possible, but also necessary and unavoidable. This assertion is founded on the motion we observe in bodies, which, 'tis maintain'd, wou'd be impossible and inconceivable without a vacuum, into which one body must move in order to make way for another. I shall not enlarge upon this objection, because it principally belongs to natural philosophy, which lies without our present sphere. In order to answer these objections, we must take the matter pretty deep, and consider the nature and origin of several ideas, lest we dispute without understanding perfectly the subject of the controversy. 'Tis evident the idea of darkness is no positive idea, but merely the negation of light, or more properly speaking, of colour'd and visible objects. A man, who enjoys his sight, receives no other perception from turning his eyes on every side, when entirely depriv'd of light, than what is common to him with one born blind; and 'tis certain such-a-one has no idea either of light or darkness. The consequence of this is, that 'tis not from the mere removal of visible objects we receive the impression of extension without matter; and that the idea of utter darkness can never be the same with that of vacuum.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三种反对意见把事情扯得更远，它不仅断言真空的概念是真实的和可能的，而且是必要的和不可避免的。这一论断是建立在我们观察到的身体运动上的，据说如果没有真空，这将是不可能的和不可想象的，一个身体必须移动到真空中，以便为另一个身体让路。我将不对这一反对意见进行详细说明，因为它主要属于自然哲学，而自然哲学不在我们目前的范围内。为了回答这些反对意见，我们必须深入研究这个问题，并考虑几个概念的性质和起源，以免我们在没有完全理解争论的主题的情况下发生争议。很明显，黑暗的概念不是积极的概念，而只是对光的否定，或者更恰当地说，对有色和可见物体的否定。一个享有视力的人，在完全没有光的情况下，把眼睛转向每一边，除了与生来就失明的人一样的感觉外，没有其他的感觉；可以肯定的是，这样的人既没有光的概念，也没有黑暗的概念。这样做的结果是，我们并非仅仅从可见物体的消失中得到没有物质的延伸的印象；而且，彻底的黑暗的概念与真空的概念永远不会相同。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Suppose again a man to be supported in the air, and to be softly convey'd along by some invisible power; 'tis evident he is sensible of nothing, and never receives the idea of extension, nor indeed any idea, from this invariable motion. Even supposing he moves his limbs to and fro, this cannot convey to him that idea. He feels in that case a certain sensation or impression, the parts of which are successive to each other, and may give him the idea of time: But certainly are not dispos'd in such a manner, as is necessary to convey the idea of space or extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">再假设一个人被支撑在空中，被某种无形的力量轻轻地传送；很明显，他什么也感觉不到，也从未从这种不变的运动中得到延伸的概念，甚至没有任何概念。即使他的四肢来回移动，这也不能向他传达这种观念。在这种情况下，他感觉到某种感觉或印象，其各部分是相互连续的，并可能给他带来时间的概念。但肯定不是以传达空间或延伸的概念所必需的方式来支配的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Since then it appears, that darkness and motion, with the utter removal of every thing visible and tangible, can never give us the idea of extension without matter, or of a vacuum; the next question is, whether they can convey this idea, when mix'd with something visible and tangible?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然如此，黑暗和运动，以及所有看得见和摸得着的东西的完全消失，永远不会给我们带来没有物质的延伸或真空的概念；接下来的问题是，当它们与看得见和摸得着的东西混合在一起时，是否能传达这种概念？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis commonly allow'd by philosophers, that all bodies, which discover themselves to the eye, appear as if painted on a plain surface, and that their different degrees of remoteness from ourselves are discover'd more by reason than by the senses. When I hold up my hand before me, and spread my fingers, they are separated as perfectly by the blue colour of the firmament, as they cou'd be by any visible object, which I cou'd place betwixt them. In order, therefore, to know whether the sight can convey the impression and idea of a vacuum, we must suppose, that amidst an entire darkness, there are luminous bodies presented to us, whose light discovers only these bodies themselves, without giving us any impression of the surrounding objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">哲学家们通常认为，所有的物体，只要发现自己的眼睛，就像画在一个普通的表面上一样，它们与我们的不同程度的距离，更多的是通过理性而不是感官来发现的。当我在面前举起我的手，张开我的手指时，它们被苍穹的蓝色完全隔开，就像我可以在它们之间放置任何可见物体一样。因此，为了了解视觉是否能传达真空的印象和概念，我们必须假设，在整个黑暗中，有发光体呈现在我们面前，其光线只发现这些体本身，而不给我们任何周围物体的印象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We must form a parallel supposition concerning the objects of our feeling. 'Tis not proper to suppose a perfect removal of all tangible objects: we must allow something to be perceiv'd by the feeling; and after an interval and motion of the hand or other organ of sensation, another object of the touch to be met with; and upon leaving that, another; and so on, as often as we please. The question is, whether these intervals do not afford us the idea of extension without body?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们必须对我们感觉的对象做一个平行的假设。假设所有的有形物体都被完全移走是不恰当的：我们必须允许一些东西被感觉到；在间隔和手或其他感觉器官的运动之后，会遇到另一个触摸的对象；在离开那个对象之后，又是另一个；如此反复，只要我们愿意。问题是，这些间隔是否没有给我们提供无体延伸的概念？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the first case; 'tis evident, that when only two luminous bodies appear to the eye, we can perceive, whether they be conjoin'd or separate; whether they be separated by a great or small distance; and if this distance varies, we can perceive its increase or diminution, with the motion of the bodies. But as the distance is not in this case any thing colour'd or visible, it may be thought that there is here a vacuum or pure extension, not only intelligible to the mind, but obvious to the very senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从第一种情况开始；很明显，当只有两个发光体出现在眼睛面前时，我们可以察觉到它们是结合还是分离；它们之间的距离是大还是小；如果这个距离变化，我们可以察觉到它的增加或减少，随着身体的运动。但是，由于在这种情况下，距离不是任何有颜色或可见的东西，可以认为这里有一个真空或纯粹的延伸，不仅对头脑是可理解的，而且对感官是明显的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This is our natural and most familiar way of thinking; but which we shall learn to correct by a little reflection. We may observe, that when two bodies present themselves, where there was formerly an entire darkness, the only change, that is discoverable, is in the appearance of these two objects, and that all the rest continues to be as before, a perfect negation of light, and of every colour'd or visible object. This is not only true of what may be said to be remote from these bodies, but also of the very distance; which is interpos'd betwixt them; <i class="calibre10">that</i> being nothing but darkness, or the negation of light; without parts, without composition, invariable and indivisible. Now since this distance causes no perception different from what a blind man receives from his eyes, or what is convey'd to us in the darkest night, it must partake of the same properties: And as blindness and darkness afford us no ideas of extension, 'tis impossible that the dark and indistinguishable distance betwixt two bodies can ever produce that idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这是我们自然的和最熟悉的思维方式；但我们将通过稍加思考学会纠正这种思维方式。我们可以观察到，当两个物体出现在原来完全黑暗的地方时，唯一可以发现的变化是这两个物体的外观，其余的都和以前一样，是对光和每一个彩色或可见物体的完美否定。这不仅适用于离这些物体较远的东西，而且适用于它们之间的距离；<i class="calibre10">它们</i>之间只有黑暗，或对光的否定；没有部分，没有构成，是不变的，不可分割的。现在，既然这种距离造成的感知与盲人从他的眼睛中得到的感知，或在最黑暗的夜晚传达给我们的感知没有什么不同，它就必须具有相同的属性。由于失明和黑暗没有给我们带来任何延伸的概念，所以两个物体之间的黑暗和不可区分的距离不可能产生这种概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The sole difference betwixt an absolute darkness and the appearance of two or more visible luminous objects consists, as I said, in the objects themselves, and in the manner they affect our senses. The angles, which the rays of light flowing from them, form with each other; the motion that is requir'd in the eye, in its passage from one to the other; and the different parts of the organs, which are affected by them; these produce the only perceptions, from which we can judge of the distance. But as these perceptions are each of them simple and indivisible, they can never give us the idea of extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如我所说，绝对的黑暗与两个或多个可见的发光物体的出现之间的唯一区别在于这些物体本身，以及它们影响我们感官的方式。从这些物体流出的光线彼此形成的角度；眼睛在从一个物体到另一个物体的过程中所需要的运动；以及器官的不同部分受到的影响；这些产生了唯一的知觉，我们可以据此判断距离。但是，由于这些感觉都是简单的、不可分割的，它们永远不会给我们带来延伸的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may illustrate this by considering the sense of feeling, and the imaginary distance or interval interpos'd betwixt tangible or solid objects.

No one will make any scruple to affirm, that it consists meerly in the perceiving those objects, and that the sensation, which arises from the motion, is in both cases the same: And as that sensation is not capable of conveying to us an idea of extension, when unaccompany'd with some other perception, it can no more give us that idea, when mix'd with the impressions of tangible objects; since that mixture produces no alteration upon it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' motion and darkness, either alone, or attended with tangible and visible objects, convey no idea of a vacuum or extension without matter, yet they are the causes why we falsly imagine we can form such an idea. For there is a close relation betwixt that motion and darkness, and a real extension, or composition of visible and tangible objects. First, We may observe, that two visible objects appearing in the midst of utter darkness, affect the senses in the same manner, and form the same angle by the rays, which flow from them, and meet in the eye, as if the distance betwixt them were fill'd with visible objects, that give us a true idea of extension. The sensation of motion is likewise the same, when there is mating tangible interpos'd betwixt two bodies, as when we feel a compounded body, whose different parts are plac'd beyond each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管运动和黑暗，无论是单独的，还是与有形的和可见的物体一起，都没有传达出没有物质的真空或延伸的概念，但它们是我们错误地想象我们可以形成这样一个概念的原因。因为这种运动和黑暗与真正的延伸或有形和无形物体的组成之间存在着密切的关系。首先，我们可以观察到，在一片漆黑中出现的两个可见物体，以同样的方式影响感官，并通过射线形成同样的角度，这些射线从它们那里流出来，并在眼睛里相遇，就像它们之间的距离充满了可见物体一样，这给我们一个真正的延伸概念。运动的感觉也是一样的，当两个物体之间存在着有形的交配时，就像我们感觉到一个复合体，它的不同部分被放置在彼此之外。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, We find by experience, that two bodies, which are so plac'd as to affect the senses in the same manner with two others, that have a certain extent of visible objects interpos'd betwixt them, are capable of receiving the same extent, without any sensible impulse or penetration, and without any change on that angle, under which they appear to the senses. In like manner, where there is one object, which we cannot feel after another without an interval, and the perceiving of that sensation we call motion in our hand or organ of sensation; experience shews us, that 'tis possible the same object may be felt with the same sensation of motion, along with the interpos'd impression of solid and tangible objects, attending the sensation. That is, in other words, an invisible and intangible distance may be converted into a visible and tangible one, without any change on the distant objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，我们根据经验发现，两个物体，如果它们的位置与另外两个物体的位置相同，对感官的影响也相同，它们之间有一定范围的可见物体，能够接受相同的范围，而没有任何感性的冲动或渗透，也没有任何角度的变化，在这种情况下，它们出现在感官上。同样，如果有一个物体，我们不能在另一个物体之后没有间隔地感觉到它，而我们的手或感觉器官对这种感觉的感知称为运动；经验告诉我们，同一物体有可能被感觉到同样的运动感觉，以及伴随这种感觉的固体和有形物体的印象。也就是说，换句话说，不可见的和无形的距离可以转化为可见的和有形的距离，而对遥远的物体没有任何改变。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, We may observe, as another relation betwixt these two kinds of distance, that they have nearly the same effects on every natural phænomenon. For as all qualities, such as heat, cold, light, attraction, &amp;c. diminish in proportion to the distance; there is but little difference observ'd, whether this distance be mark'd out by compounded and sensible objects, or be known only by the manner, in which the distant objects affect the senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，我们可以观察到，作为这两种距离之间的另一种关系，它们对每个自然现象的影响几乎都是一样的。因为所有的品质，如热、冷、光、吸引力等，都会随着距离的增加而减少；无论这种距离是由复合的、可感知的物体标示出来，还是仅由遥远的物体影响感官的方式来了解，都没有什么区别。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here then are three relations betwixt that distance, which conveys the idea of extension, and that other, which is not fill'd with any colour'd or solid object. The distant objects affect the senses in the same manner, whether separated by the one distance or the other; the second species of distance is found capable of receiving the first; and they both equally diminish the force of every quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这里有三种关系，一种是传达延伸概念的距离，另一种是没有任何颜色或实体物体的距离。遥远的物体以同样的方式影响感官，不管是相隔一种距离还是另一种距离；第二种距离被发现能够接受第一种距离；它们都同样减少了每一种质量的力量。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">These relations betwixt the two kinds of distance will afford us an easy reason, why the one has so often been taken for the other, and why we imagine we have an idea of extension without the idea of any object either of the sight or feeling. For we may establish it as a general maxim in this science of human nature, that wherever there is a close relation betwixt two ideas, the mind is very apt to mistake them, and in all its discourses and reasonings to use the one for the other. This phænomenon occurs on so many occasions, and is of such consequence, that I cannot forbear stopping a moment to examine its causes. I shall only premise, that we must distinguish exactly betwixt the phænomenon itself, and the causes, which I shall assign for it; and must not imagine from any uncertainty in the latter, that the former is also uncertain. The phænomenon may be real, tho' my explication be chimerical. The falshood of the one is no consequence of that of the other; tho' at the same time we may observe, that 'tis very natural for us to draw such a consequence; which is an evident instance of that very principle, which I endeavour to explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这两种距离之间的这些关系将为我们提供一个简单的理由，即为什么一个经常被当作另一个，以及为什么我们想象我们有一个延伸的概念，而没有任何视觉或感觉的对象的概念。因为我们可以把它作为这门人性科学的一般格言，即只要两个概念之间有密切的关系，头脑就很容易把它们搞错，并在其所有的讨论和推理中以一当百。这种现象发生在许多场合，而且具有如此大的影响，以至于我忍不住要停下来研究一下其原因。我只想说，我们必须准确区分现象本身和我为其指定的原因；不能因为后者的任何不确定性而认为前者也是不确定的。现象可能是真实的，尽管我的解释是虚构的。一个人的失败并不是另一个人的失败的结果；但同时我们可以看到，我们得出这样的结果是非常自然的；这正是我努力解释的那个原则的一个明显的例子。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">When I receiv'd the relations of <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>, <i class="calibre10">contiguity</i> and <i class="calibre10">causation</i>, as principles of union among ideas, without examining into their causes, 'twas more in prosecution of my first maxim, that we must in the end rest contented with experience, than for want of something specious and plausible, which I might have display'd on that subject. 'Twou'd have been easy to have made an imaginary dissection of the brain, and have shewn, why upon our conception of any idea, the animal spirits run into all the contiguous traces, and rouze up the other ideas, that are related to it. But tho' I have neglected any advantage, which I might have drawn from this topic in explaining the relations of ideas, I am afraid I must here have recourse to it, in order to account for the mistakes that arise from these relations. I shall therefore observe, that as the mind is endow'd with a power of exciting any idea it pleases; whenever it dispatches the spirits into that region of the brain, in which the idea is plac'd; these spirits always excite the idea, when they run into the proper traces, and rummage that cell, which belongs to the idea. But as their motion is seldom direct, and naturally turns a little to the one side or the other; for this reason the animal spirits, falling into the contiguous traces, present other related ideas in lieu of that, which the mind desir'd at first to survey. This change we are not always sensible of; but continuing still the same train of thought, make use of the related idea, which is presented to us, and employ it in our reasoning, as if it were the same with what we demanded. This is the cause of many mistakes and sophisms in philosophy; as will naturally be imagin'd, and as it wou'd be easy to show, if there was occasion.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Of the three relations above-mention'd that of resemblance is the most fertile source of error; and indeed there are few mistakes in reasoning, which do not borrow largely from that origin. Resembling ideas are not only related together, but the actions of the mind, which we employ in considering them, are so little different, that we are not able to distinguish them. This last circumstance is of great consequence; and we may in general observe, that wherever the actions of the mind in forming any two ideas are the same or resembling, we are very apt to confound these ideas, and take the one for the other. Of this we shall see many instances in the progress of this treatise. But tho' resemblance be the relation, which most readily produces a mistake in ideas, yet the others of causation and contiguity may also concur in the same influence. We might produce the figures of poets and orators, as sufficient proofs of this, were it as usual, as it is reasonable, in metaphysical subjects to draw our arguments from that quarter. But lest metaphysicians shou'd esteem this below their dignity, I shall borrow a proof from an observation, which may be made on most of their own discourses, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that 'tis usual for men to use words for ideas, and to talk instead of thinking in their reasonings. We use words for ideas, because they are commonly so closely connected, that the mind easily mistakes them. And this likewise is the reason, why we substitute the idea of a distance, which is not considered either as visible or tangible, in the room of extension, which is nothing but a composition of visible or tangible points dispos'd in a certain order. In causing this mistake there concur both the relations of <i class="calibre10">causation</i> and <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>. As the first species of distance is found to be convertible into the second, 'tis in this respect a kind of cause; and the similarity of their manner of affecting the senses, and diminishing every quality, forms the relation of resemblance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在上面提到的三种关系中，相似性是最容易产生错误的根源；事实上，推理中很少有不从这一根源出发的错误。相似的观念不仅联系在一起，而且我们在考虑这些观念时采用的思维方式差别很小，以至于我们无法将它们区分出来。这最后一个情况是非常重要的；我们可以看到，一般来说，只要思想在形成任何两个观念时的行动是相同的或相似的，我们就很容易混淆这些观念，并把一个当作另一个。在这篇论文的进展中，我们会看到很多这样的例子。但是，尽管相似是最容易在观念上产生错误的关系，但其他的因果关系和相邻关系也可能产生相同的影响。我们可以举出诗人和演说家的形象，作为这一点的充分证据，如果在形而上学的课题中，从那方面得出我们的论据，也是一样合理的。但为了避免形而上学者认为这低于他们的尊严，我将从他们自己的大部分论述中借用一个证据，<i class="calibre10">即</i>人们通常用语言来表达思想，在他们的推理中用谈话代替思考。我们用词来表达思想，是因为它们通常是紧密相连的，以至于头脑很容易将它们搞错。这也是为什么我们用距离的概念来代替延伸的概念的原因，因为距离既不被认为是可见的，也不被认为是有形的，而延伸只不过是由可见的或有形的点按一定顺序排列组成的。在造成这一错误的过程中，<i class="calibre10">因果关系</i>和<i class="calibre10">相似</i>关系同时存在。由于第一种距离被发现可以转化为第二种距离，因此在这方面是一种原因；而它们影响感官的方式的相似性，以及对每一种质量的削弱，构成了相似性的关系。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">After this chain of reasoning and explication of my principles, I am now prepared to answer all the objections that have been offer'd, whether deriv'd from <i class="calibre10">metaphysics</i> or <i class="calibre10">mechanics</i>. The frequent disputes concerning a vacuum, or extension without matter, prove not the reality of the idea, upon which the dispute turns; there being nothing more common, than to see men deceive themselves in this particular; especially when by means of any close relation, there is another idea presented, which may be the occasion of their mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在对我的原则进行了这一连串的推理和阐述之后，我现在准备回答所有被提出的反对意见，无论是从<i class="calibre10">形而上学</i>还是从<i class="calibre10">机械学</i>中得出的。关于真空或无物质的延伸的频繁争论，并不证明争论所依据的理念的真实性；没有什么比看到人们在这一点上欺骗自己更常见的了；特别是当通过任何密切的关系，有另一个理念的出现，这可能是他们错误的原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may make almost the same answer to the second objection, deriv'd from the conjunction of the ideas of rest and annihilation. When every thing is annihilated in the chamber, and the walls continue immovable, the chamber must be conceiv'd much in the same manner as at present, when the air that fills it, is not an object of the senses. This annihilation leaves to the <i class="calibre10">eye</i>, that fictitious distance, which is discover'd by the different parts of the organ, that are affected, and by the degrees of light and shade; and to the <i class="calibre10">feeling</i>, that which consists in a sensation of motion in the hand, or other member of the body. In vain shou'd we search any farther. On whichever side we turn this subject, we shall find that these are the only impressions such an object can produce after the suppos'd annihilation; and it has already been remark'd, that impressions can give rise to no ideas, but to such as resemble them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以对第二个反对意见做出几乎相同的回答，这是从静止和湮灭这两个概念的结合中得出的。当房间里的每样东西都消失了，而墙壁继续保持不动，那么房间的概念就必须和现在一样，当填充在房间里的空气不是感官的对象时，它就会被想象成同样的方式。这种消失给<i class="calibre10">眼睛</i>留下了虚构的距离，这种距离是通过器官的不同部分受到影响以及光照和阴影的程度来发现的；给<i class="calibre10">感觉</i>留下的是手或身体其他部分的运动感觉。我们再去寻找也是徒劳的。无论我们把这个问题转向哪一边，我们都会发现，这些都是这样一个物体在假定的湮灭之后所能产生的唯一印象；而且我们已经说过，印象不能产生任何观念，只能产生与之相似的观念。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Since a body interpos'd betwixt two others may be suppos'd to be annihilated, without producing any change upon such as lie on each hand of it, 'tis easily conceiv'd, how it, may be created anew, and yet produce as little alteration. Now the motion of a body has much the same effect as its creation. The distant bodies are no more affected in the one case, than in the other. This suffices to satisfy the imagination, and proves there is no repugnance in such a motion. Afterwards experience comes in play to persuade us that two bodies, situated in the manner above-describ'd, have really such a capacity of receiving body betwixt them, and that there is no obstacle to the conversion of the invisible and intangible distance into one that is visible and tangible. However natural that conversation may seem, we cannot be sure it is practicable, before we have had experience of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然一个介于两个物体之间的物体可以被认为是被消灭了，而不会对位于它两边的物体产生任何变化，那么就很容易想象，它是如何被重新创造出来的，但却产生同样少的变化。现在，一个物体的运动与它的创造有着同样的效果。在一种情况下，远处的物体不会比另一种情况下受到更多影响。这足以满足人们的想象力，并证明这种运动并不令人反感。之后，经验来说服我们，两个身体，以上面描述的方式，真的有这样的能力，接受他们之间的身体，没有障碍的无形和无形的距离转换为一个可见的和有形的。无论这种对话看起来多么自然，在我们有了经验之前，我们不能确定它是否可行。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus I seem to have answer'd the three objections above mention'd; tho' at the same time I am sensible, that few will be satisfy'd with these answers, but will immediately propose new objections and difficulties. 'Twill probably he said, that my reasoning makes nothing to the matter in hand, and that I explain only the manner in which objects affect the senses, without endeavouring to account for their real nature and operations. Tho' there be nothing visible or tangible interpos'd betwixt two bodies, yet we find <i class="calibre10">by experience</i>, that the bodies may be plac'd in the same manner, with regard to the eye, and require the same motion of the hand in passing from one to the other, as if divided by something visible and tangible. This invisible and intangible distance is also found <i class="calibre10">by experience</i> to contain a capacity of receiving body, or of becoming visible and tangible. Here is the whole of my system; and in no part of it have I endeavour'd to explain the cause, which separates bodies after this manner, and gives them a capacity of receiving others betwixt them, without any impulse or penetration.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这样，我似乎已经回答了上面提到的三个反对意见；但同时我也意识到，很少有人会对这些回答感到满意，而会立即提出新的反对意见和困难。他可能会说，我的推理对眼前的问题毫无意义，我只解释了物体影响感官的方式，而没有努力说明它们的真实性质和作用。尽管两个物体之间没有任何可见或有形的东西，但我们<i class="calibre10">根据经验</i>发现，就眼睛而言，这两个物体可以以同样的方式放置，并且在从一个物体到另一个物体时需要同样的手部动作，就像被可见和有形的东西分割一样。<i class="calibre10">根据经验</i>，这种不可见的和无形的距离也被发现含有接受身体的能力，或成为可见和有形的。这就是我的系统的全部内容；在其中的任何部分，我都没有努力解释以这种方式分开身体的原因，并使它们有能力接受它们之间的其他物体，而没有任何冲动或渗透。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I answer this objection, by pleading guilty, and by confessing that my intention never was to penetrate into the nature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their operations. For besides that this belongs not to my present purpose, I am afraid, that such an enterprize is beyond the reach of human understanding, and that we can never pretend to know body otherwise than by those external properties, which discover themselves to the senses. As to those who attempt any thing farther, I cannot approve of their ambition, till I see, in some one instance at least, that they have met with success. But at present I content myself with knowing perfectly the manner in which objects affect my senses, and their connections with each other, as far as experience informs me of them. This suffices for the conduct of life; and this also suffices for my philosophy, which pretends only to explain the nature and causes of our perceptions, or impressions and ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">对于这种反对意见，我承认有罪，并承认我的目的从来都不是要深入了解身体的本质，或解释它们运作的秘密原因。因为除了这不属于我目前的目的之外，我担心这样的研究是人类理解力所不能及的，而且我们永远不能假装认识身体，而只能通过感官发现的那些外部属性。至于那些试图做更多事情的人，我不能赞同他们的野心，除非我看到，至少在某个例子中，他们获得了成功。但目前我只满足于完全了解物体影响我的感官的方式，以及它们之间的联系，只要经验告诉我这些。这对生活行为来说已经足够了；这对我的哲学来说也足够了，因为我的哲学只想解释我们的感知，或印象和观念的性质和原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall conclude this subject of extension with a paradox, which will easily be explain'd from the foregoing reasoning. This paradox is, that if you are pleas'd to give to the invisible and intangible distance, or in other words, to the capacity of becoming visible and tangible distance, the name of a vacuum, extension and matter are the same, and yet there is a vacuum. If you will not give it that name, motion is possible in a plenum, without any impulse <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>, without returning in a circle, and without penetration. But however we may express ourselves, we must always confess, that we have no idea of any real extension without filling it with sensible objects, and conceiving its parts as visible or tangible.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将以一个悖论来结束这个关于延伸的话题，从前面的推理中很容易解释这个悖论。这个悖论是，如果你愿意给不可见的和无形的距离，或者换句话说，给成为可见的和有形的距离的能力，起一个真空的名字，那么延伸和物质是一样的，但却有一个真空。如果你不愿意给它这个名字，运动就有可能在一个羽状体中进行，没有任何冲动，在<i class="calibre10">无限</i>的范围内，没有返回的圈子，也没有渗透。但是，无论我们如何表达自己，我们必须始终承认，如果不以可感知的物体来填充它，不把它的各个部分设想为可见的或有形的，我们就对任何真正的扩展没有概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As to the doctrine, that time is nothing but the manner, in which some real objects exist; we may observe, that 'tis liable to the same objections as the similar doctrine with regard to extension. If it be a sufficient proof that we have the idea of a vacuum, because we dispute and reason concerning it; we must for the same reason have the idea of time without any changeable existence; since there is no subject of dispute more frequent and common. But that we really have no such idea, is certain. For whence shou'd it be deriv'd? Does it arise from an impression of sensation or of reflection? Point it out distinctly to us, that we may know its nature and qualities. But if you cannot point out <i class="calibre10">any such impression</i>, you may be certain you are mistaken, when you imagine you have <i class="calibre10">any such idea</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">至于说时间只不过是一些真实物体存在的方式的学说；我们可以注意到，这与关于延伸的类似学说一样，容易受到反对。如果这足以证明我们有一个真空的概念，因为我们对它有争议和推理；我们必须以同样的理由有一个没有任何变化的存在的时间概念；因为没有任何争议的主题更频繁和普遍。但是，我们确实没有这种想法，这是肯定的。因为它应该从何而来？它是由感觉的印象还是由思考的印象产生的？请向我们清楚地指出来，以便我们能知道它的性质和品质。但是，如果你不能指出<i class="calibre10">任何这样的印象</i>，你就可以肯定，当你想象你有<i class="calibre10">任何这样的想法</i>时，你是错的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' it be impossible to shew the impression, from which the idea of time without a changeable existence is deriv'd; yet we can easily point out those appearances, which make us fancy we have that idea. For we may observe, that there is a continual succession of perceptions in our mind; so that the idea of time being for ever present with us; when we consider a stedfast object at five-a-clock, and regard the same at six; we are apt to apply to it that idea in the same manner as if every moment were distinguish'd by a different position, or an alteration of the object. The first and second appearances of the object, being compar'd with the succession of our perceptions, seem equally remov'd as if the object had really chang'd. To which we may add, what experience shews us, that the object was susceptible of such a number of changes betwixt these appearances; as also that the unchangeable or rather fictitious duration has the same effect upon every quality, by encreasing or diminishing it, as that succession, which is obvious to the senses. From these three relations we are apt to confound our ideas, and imagine we can form the idea of a time and duration, without any change or succession.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管不可能显示出没有变化存在的时间观念所产生的印象，但我们可以很容易地指出那些使我们认为我们有这种观念的表象。因为我们可以观察到，在我们的头脑中存在着持续不断的感知；因此，时间的概念永远存在于我们身上；当我们在五点时考虑一个固定的物体，在六点时考虑同一个物体；我们很可能以同样的方式将这个概念应用于它，就好像每一刻都有不同的位置，或者物体的变化。物体的第一次和第二次出现，与我们的感知的连续性相比较，似乎同样被移除，就像物体真的改变了一样。此外，我们还可以补充说，经验告诉我们，在这些表象之间，物体很容易发生如此多的变化；同样，不可改变的或相当虚构的持续时间，通过增加或减少它，对每一种质量都有同样的影响，这对感官来说是明显的。从这三种关系中，我们很容易混淆我们的观念，并想象我们可以形成一个没有任何变化或连续的时间和期限的概念。</p></div>

These relations may be divided into two classes; into such as depend entirely on the ideas, which we compare together, and such as may be chang'd without any change in the ideas. 'Tis from the idea of a triangle, that we discover the relation of equality, which its three angles bear to two right ones; and this relation is invariable, as long as our idea remains the same. On the contrary, the relations of <i class="calibre10">contiguity</i> and <i class="calibre10">distance</i> betwixt two objects may be chang'd merely by an alteration of their place, without any change on the objects themselves or on their ideas; and the place depends on a hundred different accidents, which cannot be foreseen by the mind. 'Tis the same case with <i class="calibre10">identity</i> and <i class="calibre10">causation</i>. Two objects, tho' perfectly resembling each other, and even appearing in the same place at different times, may be numerically different: And as the power, by which one object produces another, is never discoverable merely from their idea, 'tis evident <i class="calibre10">cause</i> and <i class="calibre10">effect</i> are relations, of which we receive information from experience, and not from any abstract reasoning or reflection. There is no single phænomenon, even the most simple, which can be accounted for from the qualities of the objects, as they appear to us; or which we cou'd foresee without the help of our memory and experience.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">哲学关系有 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-2" id="calibre_link-403" title="13">13</a></sup>有七种不同的哲学关系，即<i class="calibre10">：相似性、同一性、时间和地点的关系、数量或数字的比例、任何质量的程度、对比性和因果关系</i>。这些关系可以分为两类；一类是完全取决于我们一起比较的观念，另一类是在观念没有任何变化的情况下可以改变的关系。从三角形的概念中，我们发现了它的三个角与两个直角之间的平等关系；只要我们的概念保持不变，这种关系就是不变的。相反，两个物体之间的<i class="calibre10">毗连</i>关系和<i class="calibre10">距离</i>关系可能仅仅因为它们的位置改变而改变，而物体本身或它们的观念没有任何变化；而位置取决于一百种不同的意外情况，这不是头脑所能预见的。<i class="calibre10">身份</i>和<i class="calibre10">因果关系</i>的情况也是如此。两个物体虽然完全相似，甚至在不同的时间出现在同一个地方，但在数量上可能是不同的。由于一个物体产生另一个物体的力量，仅仅从它们的概念中是无法发现的，因此很明显，<i class="calibre10">因果关系</i>是我们从经验中得到的信息，而不是从任何抽象的推理或思考中得到的。没有一个现象，即使是最简单的现象，可以从物体的品质中得到解释，因为它们在我们面前出现；或者说，如果没有我们的记忆和经验的帮助，我们是可以预见的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It appears, therefore, that of these seven philosophical relations, there remain only four, which depending solely upon ideas, can be the objects of knowledge and certainty. These four are <i class="calibre10">resemblance, contrariety, degrees of quality, and</i> proportions in quantity or number<i class="calibre10">. Three of these relations</i> are discoverable at first sight, and fall more properly under the province of intuition than demonstration. When any objects <i class="calibre10">resemble</i> each other, the resemblance will at first strike the eye, or rather the mind; and seldom requires a second examination. The case is the same with <i class="calibre10">contrariety</i>, and with the <i class="calibre10">degrees</i> of any <i class="calibre10">quality</i>. No one can once doubt but existence and non-existence destroy each other, and are perfectly incompatible and contrary. And tho' it be impossible to judge exactly of the degrees of any quality, such as colour, taste, heat, cold, when the difference betwixt them is very small; yet 'tis easy to decide, that any of them is superior or inferior to another, when their difference is considerable. And this decision we always pronounce at first sight, without any enquiry or reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在这七种哲学关系中，似乎只剩下四种，它们完全取决于观念，可以成为知识和确定性的对象。这四种关系是：相似<i class="calibre10">性、对比性、质量的程度和</i>数量的比例<i class="calibre10">。这些关系中的三个</i>可以在第一时间发现，属于直觉的范畴，而不是证明。当任何物体彼此<i class="calibre10">相似</i>时，这种相似性会在第一时间击中眼睛，或者说是心灵；而且很少需要进行第二次检查。<i class="calibre10">对比</i>的情况也是如此，任何<i class="calibre10">质量</i>的<i class="calibre10">程度</i>也是如此。没有人会怀疑，存在和不存在是相互破坏的，是完全不相容和相反的。虽然不可能准确判断任何质量的程度，如颜色、味道、热度、冷度，当它们之间的差异很小时；但当它们之间的差异很大时，很容易决定它们中的任何一个比另一个高或低。我们总是在第一眼看到时就作出这种决定，而不需要进行任何调查或推理。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We might proceed, after the same manner, in fixing the <i class="calibre10">proportions</i> of <i class="calibre10">quantity</i> or <i class="calibre10">number</i>, and might at one view observe a superiority or inferiority betwixt any numbers, or figures; especially where the difference is very great and remarkable. As to equality or any exact proportion, we can only guess at it from a single consideration; except in very short numbers, or very limited portions of extension; which are comprehended in an instant, and where we perceive an impossibility of falling into any considerable error. In all other cases we must settle the proportions with some liberty, or proceed in a more <i class="calibre10">artificial</i> manner.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I have already observ'd, that geometry, or the <i class="calibre10">art</i>, by which we fix the proportions of figures; tho' it much excels, both in universality and exactness, the loose judgments of the senses and imagination; yet never attains a perfect precision and exactness. Its first principles are still drawn from the general appearance of the objects; and that appearance can never afford us any security, when we examine the prodigious minuteness of which nature is susceptible. Our ideas seem to give a perfect assurance, that no two right lines can have a common segment; but if we consider these ideas, we shall find, that they always suppose a sensible inclination of the two lines, and that where the angle they form is extremely small, we have no standard of a right line so precise as to assure us of the truth of this proposition. 'Tis the same case with most of the primary decisions of the mathematics. There remain, therefore, algebra and arithmetic as the only sciences, in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possest of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. When two numbers are so combin'd, as that the one has always an unite answering to every unite of the other, we pronounce them equal; and 'tis for want of such a standard of equality in extension, that geometry can scarce be esteem'd a perfect and infallible science.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我已经注意到，几何学，或者说我们用来确定数字比例的<i class="calibre10">艺术</i>；虽然它在普遍性和精确性方面远远超过了感官和想象力的松散判断；但却从未达到完美的精确度和准确度。它的首要原则仍然是从物体的一般外观中得出的；而当我们研究自然界容易出现的惊人的细微差别时，这种外观永远无法给我们带来任何安全感。我们的想法似乎给了一个完美的保证，即没有两条直线能有一个共同的线段；但如果我们考虑这些想法，我们会发现，它们总是假定两条线有一个明显的倾斜，而且在它们形成的角度极小的情况下，我们没有一个如此精确的直线标准来保证这个命题的真实性。大多数数学的主要决定也是这样的情况。因此，代数和算术仍然是唯一的科学，在这些科学中，我们可以进行任何程度的复杂推理，但又能保持完美的精确性和确定性。我们拥有一个精确的标准，通过这个标准，我们可以判断数字的平等和比例；根据它们是否符合这个标准，我们确定它们的关系，没有任何错误的可能性。当两个数字如此结合时，一个总是有一个联合体与另一个的联合体相呼应，我们就宣布它们是相等的；正是因为缺少这样一个平等的扩展标准，几何学才很难被视为一门完美无缺的科学。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But here it may not be amiss to obviate a difficulty, which may arise from my asserting, that tho' geometry falls short of that perfect precision and certainty, which are peculiar to arithmetic and algebra, yet it excels the imperfect judgments of our senses and imagination. The reason why I impute any defect to geometry, is, because its original and fundamental principles are deriv' d merely from appearances; and it may perhaps be imagin'd, that this defect must always attend it, and keep it from ever reaching a greater exactness in the comparison of objects or ideas, than what our eye or imagination alone is able to attain. I own that this defect so far attends it, as to keep it from ever aspiring to a full certainty: But since these fundamental principles depend on the easiest and least deceitful appearances, they bestow on their consequences a degree of exactness, of which these consequences are singly incapable. 'Tis impossible for the eye to determine the angles of a chiliagon to be equal to 1996 right angles, or make any conjecture, that approaches this proportion; but when it determines, that right lines cannot concur; that we cannot draw more than one right line between two given points; its mistakes can never be of any consequence. And this is the nature and use of geometry, to run us up to such appearances, as, by reason of their simplicity, cannot lead us into any considerable error.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，在这里，我们不妨消除一个困难，这个困难可能来自于我的断言，即虽然几何学没有达到算术和代数所特有的那种完美的精确性和确定性，但它却比我们的感官和想象力的不完美判断要好。我之所以将任何缺陷归咎于几何学，是因为它的原始和基本原则仅仅是从表象中推导出来的；也许可以想象，这种缺陷必须始终伴随着它，并使它在比较物体或概念方面永远无法达到比我们的眼睛或想象力所能达到的更精确的程度。但由于这些基本原则取决于最简单和最不具欺骗性的表象，它们赋予其结果以一定程度的精确性，而这些结果是单独不能达到的。眼睛不可能确定一个斜角等于 1996 个直角，也不可能做出任何接近这一比例的猜测；但是当它确定直角线不可能同时出现，我们不可能在两个给定的点之间画出一条以上的直角线时，它的错误就不会有任何影响了。这就是几何学的性质和用途，它让我们看到这样的表象，由于它们的简单性，不会使我们陷入任何重大的错误。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall here take occasion to propose a second observation concerning our demonstrative reasonings, which is suggested by the same subject of the mathematics. 'Tis usual with mathematicians, to pretend, that those ideas, which are their objects, are of so refin'd and spiritual a nature, that they fall not under the conception of the fancy, but must be comprehended by a pure and intellectual view, of which the superior faculties of the soul are alone capable. The same notion runs thro' most parts of philosophy, and is principally made use of to explain our abstract ideas, and to shew how we can form an idea of a triangle, for instance, which shall neither be an isoceles nor scalenurn, nor be confin'd to any particular length and proportion of sides. 'Tis easy to see, why philosophers are so fond of this notion of some spiritual and refin'd perceptions; since by that means they cover many of their absurdities, and may refuse to submit to the decisions of clear ideas, by appealing to such as are obscure and uncertain. But to destroy this artifice, we need but reflect on that principle so oft insisted on, <i class="calibre10">that all our ideas are copy'd from our impressions</i>. For from thence we may immediately conclude, that since all impressions are clear and precise, the ideas, which are copy'd from them, must be of the same nature, and can never, but from our fault, contain any thing so dark and intricate. An idea is by its very nature weaker and fainter than an impression; but being in every other respect the same, cannot imply any very great mystery. If its weakness render it obscure, 'tis our business to remedy that defect, as much as possible, by keeping the idea steady and precise; and till we have done so, 'tis in vain to pretend to reasoning and philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在此，我想就我们的演示性推理提出第二点意见，这是由数学的同一主题提出的。数学家们通常认为，作为其对象的那些理念具有如此精炼和精神的性质，以至于它们不属于幻想的范畴，而必须由一种纯粹的智力观点来理解，只有灵魂的高级能力才能做到。同样的概念贯穿了哲学的大部分内容，主要用来解释我们的抽象概念，并说明我们如何形成一个三角形的概念，例如，它既不是等腰三角形，也不是鳞片形，也不限于任何特定的长度和边的比例。不难看出，为什么哲学家们如此喜欢这种关于精神和精炼的观念；因为通过这种方式，他们可以掩盖他们的许多荒谬之处，并且可以拒绝服从清晰观念的决定，而诉诸于那些模糊和不确定的观念。但要破除这种诡计，我们只需反思一下那个经常被坚持的原则，<i class="calibre10">即我们所有的观念都是从我们的印象中复制的</i>。因为从这里我们可以立即得出结论，既然所有的印象都是清晰而准确的，那么从印象中复制出来的观念就必须具有相同的性质，而且除了我们的错误之外，永远不可能包含任何如此黑暗和复杂的东西。观念就其本质而言，比印象更弱、更微弱；但在其他方面都是一样的，不可能意味着任何非常大的神秘性。如果它的弱点使它变得模糊不清，那么我们的任务就是尽可能地弥补这一缺陷，使理念保持稳定和精确；在我们这样做之前，假装推理和哲学是徒劳的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">All kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but a companion, and a discovery of those relations, either constant or inconstant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This comparison we may make, either when both the objects are present to the senses, or when neither of them is present, or when only one. When both the objects are present to the senses along with the relation, we call <i class="calibre10">this</i> perception rather than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or any action, properly speaking, but a mere passive admission of the impressions thro' the organs of sensation. According to this way of thinking, we ought not to receive as reasoning any of the observations we may make concerning <i class="calibre10">identity</i>, and the <i class="calibre10">relations</i> of <i class="calibre10">time</i> and <i class="calibre10">place</i>; since in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations of objects. 'Tis only <i class="calibre10">causation</i>, which produces such a connexion, as to give us assurance from the existence or action of one object, that 'twas follow'd or preceded by any other existence or action; nor can the other two relations be ever made use of in reasoning, except so far as they either affect or are affected by it. There is nothing in any objects to perswade us, that they are either always <i class="calibre10">remote</i> or always <i class="calibre10">contiguous</i>; and when from experience and observation we discover, that their relation in this particular is invariable, we always conclude there is some secret <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, which separates or unites them. The same reasoning extends to <i class="calibre10">identity</i>. We readily suppose an object may continue individually the same, tho' several times absent from and present to the senses; and ascribe to it an identity, notwithstanding the interruption of the perception, whenever we conclude, that if we had kept our eye or hand constantly upon it, it wou'd have convey'd an invariable and uninterrupted perception. But this conclusion beyond the impressions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of <i class="calibre10">cause and effect</i>; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the object is not chang'd upon us, however much the new object may resemble that which was formerly present to the senses. Whenever we discover such a perfect resemblance, we consider, whether it be common in that species of objects; whether possibly or probably any cause cou'd operate in producing the change and resemblance; and according as we determine concerning these causes and effects, we form our judgment concerning the identity of the object.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Let us therefore cast our eye on any two objects, which we call cause and effect, and turn them on all sides, in order to find that impression, which produces an idea of such prodigious consequence. At first sight I perceive, that I must not search for it in any of the particular qualities of the objects; since, which-ever of these qualities I pitch on, I find some object, that is not possest of it, and yet falls under the denomination of cause or effect. And indeed there is nothing existent, either externally or internally, which is not to be consider'd either as a cause or an effect; tho' 'tis plain there is no one quality, which universally belongs to all beings, and gives them a title to that denomination. The idea, then, of causation must be deriv'd from some <i class="calibre10">relation</i> among objects; and that relation we must now endeavour to discover. I find in the first place, that whatever objects are consider'd as causes or effects, are <i class="calibre10">contiguous</i>; and that nothing can operate in a time or place, which is ever so little remov'd from those of its existence. Tho' distant objects may sometimes seem productive of each other, they are commonly found upon examination to be link'd by a chain of causes, which are contiguous among themselves, and to the distant objects; and when in any particular instance we cannot discover this connexion, we still presume it to exist. We may therefore consider the relation of contiguity as essential to that of causation; at least may suppose it such, according to the general opinion, till we can find a more<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-183" id="calibre_link-246" title="14">14</a></sup> proper occasion to clear up this matter, by examining what objects are or are not susceptible of juxta-position and conjunction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The second relation I shall observe as essential to causes and effects, is not so universally acknowledge'd, but is liable to some controversy. 'Tis that of priority of time in the cause before the effect. Some pretend that 'tis not absolutely necessary a cause shou'd precede its effect; but that any object or action, in the very first moment of its existence, may exert its productive quality, and give rise to another object or action, perfectly co-temporary with itself. But beside that experience in most instances seems to contradict this opinion, we may establish the relation of priority by a kind of inference or reasoning. 'Tis an establish'd maxim both in natural and moral philosophy, that an object, which exists for any time in its full perfection without producing another, is not its sole cause; but is assisted by some other principle, which pushes it from its state of inactivity, and makes it exert that energy, of which it was secretly possest. Now if any cause may be perfectly co-temporary with its effect, 'tis certain, according to this maxim, that they must all of them be so; since any one of them, which retards its operation for a single moment, exerts not itself at that very individual time, in which it might have operated; and therefore is no proper cause. The consequence of this wou'd be no less than the destruction of that succession of causes, which we observe in the world; and indeed, the utter annihilation of time. For if one cause were co-temporary with its effect, and this effect with <i class="calibre10">its</i> effect, and so on, 'tis plain there wou'd be no such thing as succession, and all objects must be co-existent.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我将观察到的第二种关系，作为原因和结果的必要条件，并不是那么普遍地被承认，而是容易引起一些争论。这就是时间上的优先性，即因先于果。有些人认为，“并非绝对需要因先于果；但任何物体或行动，在其存在的最初时刻，就可以发挥其生产性，并产生另一个物体或行动，与自己完全同时。但是，除了经验在大多数情况下似乎与这一观点相矛盾之外，我们可以通过一种推论或推理来确定优先权的关系。在自然哲学和道德哲学中都有一条公认的格言，即一个物体在任何时候以其完全的完美状态存在而不产生另一个物体，并不是它唯一的原因；而是由其他一些原则协助，把它从其不活动的状态中推了出来，并使它发挥出它秘密拥有的能量。现在，如果任何原因都可能与它的效果完全同步，那么根据这条格言，可以肯定的是，它们都必须如此；因为其中任何一个原因，只要推迟了它的运作时间，就不会在它可能运作的那个个别时间内发挥自己的作用；因此，它不是适当的原因。这样做的后果将不亚于破坏我们在世界中观察到的原因的连续性；而且实际上是时间的彻底湮灭。因为如果一个原因与它的效果同时存在，而这个效果与<i class="calibre10">它的</i>效果同时存在，以此类推，很明显，就不会有所谓的继承，所有的物体都必须同时存在。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the first question concerning the necessity of a cause: 'Tis a general maxim in philosophy, that <i class="calibre10">what-ever</i> begins to exist, must have a cause of existence. This is commonly taken for granted in all reasonings, without any proof given or demanded 'Tis suppos'd to be founded on intuition, and to be one of those maxims, which tho' they may be deny'd with the lips, 'tis impossible for men in their hearts really to doubt of. But if we examine this maxim by the idea of knowledge above—explain'd, we shall discover in it no mark of any such intuitive certainty; but on the contrary shall find, that 'tis of a nature quite foreign to that species of conviction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先是关于原因的必要性的第一个问题。哲学上有一条普遍的格言，即<i class="calibre10">凡是</i>开始存在的<i class="calibre10">东西</i>，必定有其存在的原因。这在所有的推理中通常被认为是理所当然的，没有给出或要求任何证据。它被认为是建立在直觉的基础上，是那些虽然嘴上否认，但人们在心里不可能真正怀疑的格言之一。但是，如果我们用上面解释的知识概念来审视这条格言，我们就会发现它没有任何这种直觉上的确定性的标志；相反，我们会发现，它的性质与这种信念的种类完全不同。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">All certainty arises from the comparison of ideas, and from the discovery of such relations as are unalterable, so long as the ideas continue the same. These relations are <i class="calibre10">resemblance, proportions in quantity and number, degrees of any quality, and contrariety</i>; none of which are imply'd in this proposition, <i class="calibre10">Whatever has a beginning has also a cause of existence.</i> That proposition therefore is not intuitively certain. At least any one, who wou'd assert it to be intuitively certain, must deny these to be the only infallible relations, and must find some other relation of that kind to be imply'd in it; which it will then be time enough to examine.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">所有的确定性都来自于观念的比较，来自于发现这种关系，只要这些观念继续保持不变，就不会改变。这些关系是相似<i class="calibre10">性、数量和数目的比例、任何质量的程度和反差</i>；这些都不是这个命题所暗示的，即<i class="calibre10">凡是有始有终的东西都有存在的原因。</i>因此，这个命题在直觉上是不确定的。至少，任何断言它是直观确定的人，都必须否认这些是唯一无懈可击的关系，必须找到其中隐含的其他关系；然后才有足够的时间来研究。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But here is an argument, which proves at once, that the foregoing proposition is neither intuitively nor demonstrably certain. We can never demonstrate the necessity of a cause to every new existence, or new modification of existence, without shewing at the same time the impossibility there is, that any thing can ever begin to exist without some productive principle; and where the latter proposition cannot be prov'd, we must despair of ever being able to prove the former. Now that the latter proposition is utterly incapable of a demonstrative proof, we may satisfy ourselves by considering, that as all distinct ideas are separable from each other, and as the ideas of cause and effect are evidently distinct, 'twill be easy for us to conceive any object to be non-existent this moment, and existent the next, without conjoining to it the distinct idea of a cause or productive principle. The separation, therefore, of the idea of a cause from that of a beginning of existence, is plainly possible for the imagination; and consequently the actual separation of these objects is so far possible, that it implies no contradiction nor absurdity; and is therefore incapable of being refuted by any reasoning from mere ideas; without which 'tis impossible to demonstrate the necessity of a cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但这里有一个论据，它立即证明，上述命题既不是直观的，也不是明显的确定的。我们永远无法证明每一个新的存在或存在的新变化都必须有一个原因，而不同时说明任何事物在没有某种生产原则的情况下开始存在是不可能的；如果后一个命题无法证明，我们就必须对能够证明前一个命题感到绝望。既然后一个命题完全无法得到证明，我们可以通过考虑来满足自己，因为所有不同的观念都是可以相互分离的，而原因和结果的观念显然是不同的，我们很容易设想任何物体在这一刻是不存在的，在下一刻是存在的，而不需要把原因或生产原则的独特观念与它联系起来。因此，将原因的概念与存在的开始的概念分开，对想象力来说显然是可能的；因此，这些对象的实际分离是如此的可能，以至于它不意味着矛盾或荒谬；因此，不能被任何来自单纯概念的推理所驳倒；没有这些，就不可能证明原因的必要性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Accordingly we shall find upon examination, that every demonstration, which has been produc'd for the necessity of a cause, is fallacious and sophistical. All the points of time and place,<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-256" id="calibre_link-307" title="15">15</a></sup> say some philosophers, in which we can suppose any object to begin to exist, are in themselves equal; and unless there be some cause, which is peculiar to one time and to one place, and which by that means determines and fixes the existence, it must remain in eternal suspence; and the object can never begin to be, for want of something to fix its beginning. But I ask; Is there any more difficulty in supposing the time and place to be fix'd without a cause, than to suppose the existence to be determin'd in that manner? The first question that occurs on this subject is always, <i class="calibre10">whether</i> the object shall exist or not: The next, <i class="calibre10">when</i> and <i class="calibre10">where</i> it shall begin to exist. If the removal of a cause be intuitively absurd in the one case, it must be so in the other: And if that absurdity be not clear without a proof in the one case, it will equally require one in the other. The absurdity, then, of the one supposition can never be a proof of that of the other; since they are both upon the same footing, and must stand or fall by the same reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们在研究后会发现，每一个证明，都是为了证明原因的必要性，都是谬误和诡辩。一些哲学家说，所有的时间点和地点，我们都可以假设任何物体在其中开始。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-256" id="calibre_link-307" title="15">15</a></sup>有些哲学家说，我们可以假定任何物体开始存在的所有时间和地点，本身都是平等的；除非有某种原因，是某个时间和地点所特有的，并且通过这种方式决定和固定了存在，否则它必须保持永恒的悬浮状态；物体永远不可能开始存在，因为没有东西来固定其开始。但我要问：假设时间和地点无缘无故地被固定下来，是否比假设存在以这种方式被决定更困难？在这个问题上出现的第一个问题总是，对象<i class="calibre10">是否</i>会存在。其次是，它将<i class="calibre10">在</i> <i class="calibre10">何时何地</i>开始存在。如果在一种情况下消除原因在直觉上是荒谬的，那么在另一种情况下也一定是如此。如果这种荒谬性在一种情况下不需要证明就能明确，那么在另一种情况下同样需要证明。那么，一个假设的荒谬性永远不能成为另一个假设的证据；因为它们都在同一基础上，必须通过同样的推理才能成立或失败。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The second argument, <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-257" id="calibre_link-167" title="16">16</a></sup> which I find us'd on this head, labours under an equal difficulty. Every thing, 'tis said, must have a cause; for if any thing wanted a cause, <i class="calibre10">it</i> wou'd produce <i class="calibre10">itself</i>; that is, exist before it existed; which is impossible. But this reasoning is plainly inconclusive; because it supposes, that in our denial of a cause we still grant what we expresly deny, <i class="calibre10">vis.</i> that there must be a cause; which therefore is taken to be the object itself; and <i class="calibre10">that</i>, no doubt, is an evident contradiction. But to say that any thing is produc'd, or to express myself more properly, comes into existence, without a cause, is not to affirm, that 'tis itself its own cause; but on the contrary in excluding all external causes, excludes <i class="calibre10">a fortiori</i> the thing itself which is created. An object, that exists absolutely without any cause, certainly is not its own cause; and when you assert, that the one follows from the other, you suppose the very point in question, and take it for granted, that 'tis utterly impossible any thing can ever begin to exist without a cause, but that upon the exclusion of one productive principle, we must still have recourse to another.</p>

Whatever is produc'd without any cause, is produc'd by <i class="calibre10">nothing</i>; or in other words, has nothing for its cause. But nothing can never be a cause, no more than it can be something, or equal to two right angles. By the same intuition, that we perceive nothing not to be equal to two right angles, or not to be something, we perceive, that it can never be a cause; and consequently must perceive, that every object has a real cause of its existence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I believe it will not be necessary to employ many words in shewing the weakness of this argument, after what I have said of the foregoing. They are all of them founded on the same fallacy, and are deriv'd from the same turn of thought. 'Tis sufficient only to observe, that when we exclude all causes we really do exclude them, and neither suppose nothing nor the object itself to be the causes of the existence; and consequently can draw no argument from the absurdity of these suppositions to prove the absurdity of that exclusion. If every thing must have a cause, it follows, that upon the exclusion of other causes we must accept of the object itself or of nothing as causes. But 'tis the very point in question, whether every thing must have a cause or not; and therefore, according to all just reasoning, it ought never to be taken for granted.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我相信，在我对前述论点说过之后，没有必要用很多话来说明这个论点的弱点。它们都是建立在同样的谬误之上的，都是由同样的思维方式衍生出来的。我们只需注意到，当我们排除所有的原因时，我们确实排除了它们，既没有假设任何东西，也没有假设对象本身是存在的原因；因此，不能从这些假设的荒谬性中得出任何论据来证明这种排除的荒谬性。如果每件事情都必须有一个原因，那么，在排除其他原因的情况下，我们必须接受物体本身或无物为原因。但这正是问题的关键所在，即每件事情是否必须有一个原因；因此，根据所有公正的推理，它永远不应该被认为是理所当然的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">They are still more frivolous, who say, that every effect must have a cause, because 'tis imply'd in the very idea of effect. Every effect necessarily pre-supposes a cause; effect being a relative term, of which cause is the correlative. But this does not prove, that every being must be preceded by a cause; no more than it follows, because every husband must have a wife, that therefore every man must be marry'd. The true state of the question is, whether every object, which begins to exist, must owe its existence to a cause; and this I assert neither to be intuitively nor demonstratively certain, and hope to have prov'd it sufficiently by the foregoing arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">更有甚者，他们说，每一个效果都必须有一个原因，因为这隐含在效果的概念中。每一个效果都必然以一个原因为前提；效果是一个相对的术语，而原因是其相关的。但这并不能证明每个存在都必须先有一个原因；就像因为每个丈夫都必须有一个妻子，所以每个男人都必须结婚一样。问题的真实情况是，是否每一个开始存在的物体都必须把它的存在归功于一个原因；我断言这一点既不是直观的，也不是证明的，我希望通过前面的论证充分地证明这一点。</p></div>

When we infer effects from causes, we must establish the existence of these causes; which we have only two ways of doing, either by an immediate perception of our memory or senses, or by an inference from other causes; which causes again we must ascertain in the same manner, either by a present impression, or by an inference from <i class="calibre10">their</i> causes, and so on, till we arrive at some object, which we see or remember.

'Tis obvious all this chain of argument or connexion of causes and effects, is at first founded on those characters or letters, which are seen or remember'd, and that without the authority either of the memory or senses our whole reasoning wou'd be chimerical and without foundation. Every link of the chain wou'd in that case hang upon another; but there wou'd not be any thing fix'd to one end of it, capable of sustaining the whole; and consequently there wou'd be no belief nor evidence.

		<p class="block_6 en">When we search for the characteristic, which distinguishes the <i class="calibre10">memory</i> from the imagination, we must immediately perceive, that it cannot lie in the simple ideas it presents to us; since both these faculties borrow their simple ideas from the impressions, and can never go beyond these original perceptions. These faculties are as little distinguish'd from each other by the arrangement of their complex ideas. For tho' it be a peculiar property of the memory to preserve the original order and position of its ideas, while the imagination transposes and changes them, as it pleases; yet this difference is not sufficient to distinguish them in their operation, or make us know the one from the other; it being impossible to recal the past impressions, in order to compare them with our present ideas, and see whether their arrangement be exactly similar. Since therefore the memory is known, neither by the order of its <i class="calibre10">complex</i> ideas, nor the nature of its <i class="calibre10">simple</i> ones; it follows, that the difference betwixt it and the imagination lies in its superior force and vivacity. A man may indulge his fancy in feigning any past scene of adventures; nor wou'd there be any possibility of distinguishing this from a remembrance of a like kind, were not the ideas of the imagination fainter and more obscure.</p>

The more recent this memory is, the clearer is the idea; and when after a long interval he would return to the contemplation of his object, he always finds its idea to be much decay'd, if not wholly obliterated. We are frequently in doubt concerning the ideas of the memory, as they become very weak and feeble; and are at a loss to determine whether any image proceeds from the fancy or the memory, when it is not drawn in such lively colours as distinguish that latter faculty. I think, I remember such an event, says one; but am not sure. A long tract of time has almost worn it out of my memory, and leaves me uncertain whether or not it be the pure offspring of my fancy.</p>

This is noted in the case of liars; who by the frequent repetition of their lies, come at last to believe and remember them, as realities; custom and habit having in this case, as in many others, the same influence on the mind as nature, and infixing the idea with equal force and vigour.</p>

There is no object, which implies the existence of any other if we consider these objects in themselves, and never look beyond the ideas which we form of them. Such an inference wou'd amount to knowledge, and wou'd imply the absolute contradiction and impossibility of conceiving any thing different. But as all distinct ideas are separable, 'tis evident there can be no impossibility of that kind. When we pass from a present impression to the idea of any object, we might possibly have separated the idea from the impression, and have substituted any other idea in its room.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很容易观察到，在追踪这种关系时，我们从因到果所得出的推论，并不仅仅来自于对这些特定对象的调查，以及对其本质的深入了解，从而发现两者之间的依赖关系。如果我们只考虑这些对象本身，而不去看我们对它们形成的观念以外的东西，就没有任何对象意味着任何其他对象的存在。这样的推论就等于知识，就意味着绝对的矛盾和不可能设想出任何不同的东西。但是，由于所有不同的观念都是可以分离的，显然不可能存在这种不可能。当我们从现在的印象转到任何物体的观念时，我们可能已经把观念从印象中分离出来，用任何其他的观念来代替它。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis therefore by experience only, that we can infer the existence of one object from that of another. The nature of experience is this. We remember to have had frequent instances of the existence of one species of objects; and also remember, that the individuals of another species of objects have always attended them, and have existed in a regular order of contiguity and succession with regard to them. Thus we remember to have seen that species of object we call <i class="calibre10">flame</i>, and to have felt that species of sensation we call <i class="calibre10">heat</i>. We likewise call to mind their constant conjunction in all past instances. Without any farther ceremony, we call the one <i class="calibre10">cause</i> and the other <i class="calibre10">effect</i>, and infer the existence of the one from that of the other. In all those instances, from which we learn the conjunction of particular causes and effects, both the causes and effects have been perceiv'd by the senses, and are remember'd: But in all cases, wherein we reason concerning them, there is only one perceiv'd or remember'd, and the other is supply'd in conformity to our past experience.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus in advancing we have insensibly discover'd a new relation betwixt cause and effect, when we least expected it, and were entirely employ'd upon another subject. This relation is their constant conjunction. Contiguity and succession are not sufficient to make us pronounce any two objects to be cause and effect, unless we perceive, that these two relations are preserv'd in several instances. We may now see the advantage of quitting the direct survey of this relation, in order to discover the nature of that <i class="calibre10">necessary connexion</i>, which makes so essential a part of it. There are hopes, that by this means we may at last arrive at our propos'd end; tho' to tell the truth, this new-discover'd relation of a constant conjunction seems to advance us but very little in our way. For it implies no more than this, that like objects have always been plac'd in like relations of contiguity and succession; and it seems evident, at least at first sight, that by this means we can never discover any new idea, and can only multiply, but not enlarge the objects of our mind. It may be thought, that what we learn not from one object, we can never learn from a hundred, which are all of the same kind, and are perfectly resembling in every circumstance. As our senses shew us in one instance two bodies, or motions, or qualities in certain relations of succession and contiguity; so our memory presents us only with a multitude of instances, wherein we always find like bodies, motions, or qualities in like relations. From the mere repetition of any past impression, even to infinity, there never will arise any new original idea, such as that of a necessary connexion; and the number of impressions has in this case no more effect than if we confin'd ourselves to one only. But tho' this reasoning seems just and obvious; yet as it wou'd be folly to despair too soon, we shall continue the thread of our discourse; and having found, that after the discovery of the constant conjunction of any objects, we always draw an inference from one object to another, we shall now examine the nature of that inference, and of the transition from the impression to the idea. Perhaps 'twill appear in the end, that the necessary connexion depends on the inference, instead of the inference's depending on the necessary connexion. Since it appears, that the transition from an impression present to the memory or senses to the idea of an object, which we call cause or effect, is founded on past <i class="calibre10">experience</i>, and on our remembrance of their <i class="calibre10">constant conjunction</i>, the next question is, Whether experience produces the idea by means of the understanding or of the imagination; whether we are determin'd by reason to make the transition, or by a certain association and relation of perceptions. If reason determin'd us, it wou'd proceed upon that principle, <i class="calibre10">that instances, of which we have had no experience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the course of nature continues always uniformly the same</i>. In order therefore to clear up this matter, let us consider all the arguments, upon which such a proposition may be suppos'd to be founded; and as these must be deriv' d either from <i class="calibre10">knowledge</i> or <i class="calibre10">probability</i>, let us cast our eye on each of these degrees of evidence, and see whether they afford any just conclusion of this nature.</p>

For one may fix his attention during some time on any one object without looking farther. They are not the sole causes.

		<p class="block_6 en">There is indeed a principle of union among ideas, which at first sight may be esteem'd different from any of these, but will be found at the bottom to depend on the same origin. When ev'ry individual of any species of objects is found by experience to be constantly united with an individual of another species, the appearance of any new individual of either species naturally conveys the thought to its usual attendant. Thus because such a particular idea is commonly annex'd to such a particular word, nothing is requir'd but the hearing of that word to produce the correspondent idea; and 'twill scarce be possible for the mind, by its utmost efforts, to prevent that transition. In this case it is not absolutely necessary, that upon hearing such a particular sound, we shou'd reflect on any past experience, and consider what idea has been usually connected with the sound.

		<p class="block_6 cn">观念之间确实有一个结合的原则，乍一看，它可能被认为与上述任何一个不同，但从根本上会发现它取决于同一个起源。当任何种类的物体的每一个个体都被经验发现与另一种类的个体经常结合在一起时，任何一个种类的新个体的出现都会自然而然地把这个想法传达给它的常客。因此，由于这样一个特定的想法通常与这样一个特定的词相联系，除了听到这个词就可以产生相应的想法；而且心灵几乎不可能通过其最大的努力来阻止这种转变。在这种情况下，我们没有必要在听到这种特定的声音时，反思过去的经验，并考虑通常与这种声音有关的想法。想象力本身就提供了这种思考的场所，并且习惯于从文字到概念，以至于它在听到一个声音和构想另一个声音之间没有片刻的延迟。</p></div>

We cannot penetrate into the reason of the conjunction. We only observe the thing itself, and always find that from the constant conjunction the objects acquire an union in the imagination.

We may mingle, and unite, and separate, and confound, and vary our ideas in a hundred different ways; but 'till there appears some principle, which fixes one of these different situations, we have in reality no opinion: And this principle, as it plainly makes no addition to our precedent ideas, can only change the <i class="calibre10">manner</i> of our conceiving them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">All the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> impressions and ideas, which differ from each other only in their different degrees of force and vivacity. Our ideas are copy'd from our impressions, and represent them in all their parts. When you wou'd any way vary the idea of a particular object, you can only encrease or diminish its force and vivacity. If you make any other change on it, it represents a different object or impression. The case is the same as in colours. A particular shade of any colour may acquire a new degree of liveliness or brightness without any other variation. But when you produce any other variation, 'tis no longer the same shade or colour. So that as belief does nothing but vary the manner, in which we conceive any object, it can only bestow on our ideas an additional force and vivacity. An opinion, therefore, or belief may be most accurately defin'd, A lively idea related to or associated with a present impression<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-157" id="calibre_link-428" title="18">18</a></sup>.</p>

When we infer the existence of an object from that of others, some object must always be present either to the memory or senses, in order to be the foundation of our reasoning; since the mind cannot run up with its inferences <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>. Reason can never satisfy us that the existence of any one object does ever imply that of another; so that when we pass from the impression of one to the idea or belief of another, we are not determin'd by reason, but by custom or a principle of association. But belief is somewhat more than a simple idea. 'Tis a particular manner of forming an idea: And as the same idea can only be vary'd by a variation of its degrees of force and vivacity; it follows upon the whole, that belief is a lively idea produc'd by a relation to a present impression, according to the foregoing definition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I wou'd willingly establish it as a general maxim in the science of human nature, <i class="calibre10">that when any impression becomes present to us, it not only transports the mind to such ideas as are related to it, but likewise communicates to them a share of its force and vivacity</i>. All the operations of the mind depend in a great measure on its disposition, when it performs them; and according as the spirits are more or less elevated, and the attention more or less fix'd, the action will always have more or less vigour and vivacity. When therefore any object is presented, which elevates and enlivens the thought, every action, to which the mind applies itself, will be more strong and vivid, as long as that disposition continues. Now 'tis evident the continuance of the disposition depends entirely on the objects, about which the mind is employ'd; and that any new object naturally gives a new direction to the spirits, and changes the disposition; as on the contrary, when the mind fixes constantly on the same object, or passes easily and insensibly along related objects, the disposition has a much longer duration. Hence it happens, that when the mind is once inliven'd by a present impression, it proceeds to form a more lively idea of the related objects, by a natural transition of the disposition from the one to the other. The change of the objects is so easy, that the mind is scarce sensible of it, but applies itself to the conception of the related idea with all the force and vivacity it acquir'd from the present impression.</p>

We may, therefore, observe, as the first experiment to our present purpose, that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend, our idea of him is evidently inliven'd by the <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>, and that every passion, which that idea occasions, whether of joy or sorrow, acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect there concur both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no resemblance, or at least was not intended for him, it never so much as conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the person; tho' the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be rather weaken'd than inliven'd by that transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend, when 'tis set before us; but when 'tis remov'd, rather choose to consider him directly, than by reflexion in an image, which is equally distant and obscure.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The ceremonies of the <i class="calibre10">Roman Catholic</i> religion may be consider'd as experiments of the same nature. The devotees of that strange superstition usually plead in excuse of the mummeries, with which they are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of those external motions, and postures, and actions, in inlivening their devotion, and quickening their fervour, which otherwise wou'd decay away, if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these types, than 'tis possible for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible objects have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this influence they readily convey to those ideas, to which they are related, and which they resemble. I shall only infer from these practices, and this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance in inlivening the idea is very common; and as in every case a resemblance and a present impression must concur, we are abundantly supply'd with experiments to prove the reality of the foregoing principle.</p>

'Tis certain, that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and that upon our approach to any object; tho' it does not discover itself to our senses; it operates upon the mind with an influence that imitates an immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily transports the mind to what is contiguous; but 'tis only the actual presence of an object that transports it with a superior vivacity. When I am a few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues distant; tho' even at that distance the reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends and family naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter case, both the objects of the mind are ideas; notwithstanding there is an easy transition betwixt them; that transition alone is not able to give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate impression.</p>

Superstitious people are fond of the relicts of saints and holy men for the same reason that they seek after types and images, in order to inliven their devotion, and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives, which they desire to imitate. Now 'tis evident, one of the best relicks a devotee cou'd procure, wou'd be the handy work of a saint; and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be consider'd in this light, 'tis because they were once at his disposal, and were mov'd and affected by him; in which respect they are to be consider'd as imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a shorter chain of consequences than any of those, from which we learn the reality of his existence.

'Tis certain we must have an idea of every matter of fact, which we believe. 'Tis certain, that this idea arises only from a relation to a present impression. 'Tis certain, that the belief super-adds nothing to the idea, but only changes our manner of conceiving it, and renders it more strong and lively. The present conclusion concerning the influence of relation is the immediate consequence of all these steps; and every step appears to me sure and infallible. There enters nothing into this operation of the mind but a present impression, a lively idea, and a relation or association in the fancy betwixt the impression and idea; so that there can be no suspicion of mistake.</p>

Here 'tis evident, that however that object, which is present to my senses, and that other, whose existence I infer by reasoning, may be thought to influence each other by their particular powers or qualities; yet as the phænomenon of belief, which we at present examine, is merely internal, these powers and qualities, being entirely unknown, can have no hand in producing it. 'Tis the present impression, which is to be consider'd as the true and real cause of the idea, and of the belief which attends it.

I find, that an impression, from which, on its first appearance, I can draw no conclusion, may afterwards become the foundation of belief, when I have had experience of its usual consequences. We must in every case have observ'd the same impression in past instances, and have found it to be constantly conjoin'd with some other impression. This is confirm'd by such a multitude of experiments, that it admits not of the smallest doubt.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">From a second observation I conclude, that the belief which attends the present impression, and is produc'd by a number of past impressions and conjunctions; that this belief, I say, arises immediately, without any new operation of the reason or imagination. Of this I can be certain, because I never am conscious of any such operation, and find nothing in the subject, on which it can be founded. Now as we call every thing custom, which proceeds from a past repetition, without any new reasoning or conclusion, we may establish it as a certain truth, that all the belief, which follows upon any present impression, is deriv'd solely from that origin. When we are accustom'd to see two impressions conjoin'd together, the appearance or idea of the one immediately carries us to the idea of the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Being fully satisfy'd on this head, I make a third set of experiments, in order to know, whether any thing be requisite, beside the customary transition, towards the production of this phænomenon of belief. I therefore change the first impression into an idea; and observe, that tho' the customary transition to the correlative idea still remains, yet there is in reality no belief nor persuasion. A present impression, then, is absolutely requisite to this whole operation; and when after this I compare an impression with an idea, and find that their only difference consists in their different degrees of force and vivacity, I conclude upon the whole, that belief is a more vivid and intense conception of an idea, proceeding from its relation to a present impression.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这一点上我很满意，于是我又做了第三组实验，以了解在产生这种信仰现象的过程中，除了习惯性的过渡之外，是否还有其他必要的东西。因此，我把第一印象变成了一个观念；并且观察到，尽管向相关观念的惯常过渡仍然存在，但实际上并没有信仰或说服力。因此，整个过程绝对需要一个现在的印象；当我把印象和观念进行比较后，发现它们唯一的区别在于它们的力量和活力程度不同，我得出的结论是，总的来说，信仰是对一个观念更生动、更强烈的概念，源于它与现在印象的关系。</p></div>

No surely; this is not the method in which he proceeds in his reasoning.

The custom operates before we have time for reflection. The objects seem so inseparable, that we interpose not a moment's delay in passing from the one to the other. But as this transition proceeds from experience, and not from any primary connexion betwixt the ideas, we must necessarily acknowledge, that experience may produce a belief and a judgment of causes and effects by a secret operation, and without being once thought of.

		<p class="block_6 cn">这里值得我们注意的是，我们所有关于因果关系的判断所依赖的过去的经验，可能以一种不为人知的方式作用于我们的头脑，以至于从未被注意到，甚至在某种程度上可能不为我们所知。一个人在旅途中遇到河流就会停下脚步，他预见到了自己前进的后果；他对这些后果的认识是由过去的经验传达给他的，这些经验告诉他这种特定的因果关系的组合。但我们能认为，在这个场合，他反思过去的任何经验，并唤起他所看到或听到的例子，以发现水对动物身体的影响？当然不是；这不是他进行推理的方法。下沉的概念与水的概念密切相关，窒息的概念与下沉的概念密切相关，以至于头脑在没有记忆的帮助下完成了过渡。在我们有时间进行思考之前，这种习惯就已经开始了。这些对象似乎是如此密不可分，以至于我们在从一个对象转到另一个对象时没有片刻的延迟。但是，由于这种转变来自于经验，而不是来自于观念之间的任何主要联系，我们必须承认，经验可能会通过秘密的操作，在没有想到的情况下，产生对原因和结果的信念和判断。这就消除了所有的借口，如果还有任何借口的话，那就是断言心灵被推理说服的原则，<i class="calibre10">即我们没有经验的事例，必然与我们有</i>经验的事例相似。因为我们在这里发现，理解力或想象力可以从过去的经验中得出推论，而不需要对它进行反思；更不需要对它形成任何原则，或根据该原则进行推理。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general we may observe, that in all the most establish'd and uniform conjunctions of causes and effects, such as those of gravity, impulse, solidity, &amp;c., the mind never carries its view expressly to consider any past experience: Tho' in other associations of objects, which are more rare and unusual, it may assist the custom and transition of ideas by this reflection. Nay we find in some cases, that the reflection produces the belief without the custom; or more properly speaking, that the reflection produces the custom in an <i class="calibre10">oblique</i> and <i class="calibre10">artificial</i> manner. I explain myself. 'Tis certain, that not only in philosophy, but even in common life, we may attain the knowledge of a particular cause merely by one experiment, provided it be made with judgment, and after a careful removal of all foreign and superfluous circumstances. Now as after one experiment of this kind, the mind, upon the appearance either of the cause or the effect, can draw an inference concerning the existence of its correlative; and as a habit can never be acquir'd merely by one instance; it may be thought, that belief cannot in this case be esteem'd the effect of custom. But this difficulty will vanish, if we consider, that tho' we are here suppos'd to have had only one experiment of a particular effect, yet we have many millions to convince us of this principle; <i class="calibre10">that like objects, plac'd in like circumstances, will always produce like effects;</i> and as this principle has establish'd itself by a sufficient custom, it bestows an evidence and firmness on any opinion, to which it can be apply'd. The connexion of the ideas is not habitual after one experiment; but this connexion is comprehended under another principle, that is habitual; which brings us back to our hypothesis. In all cases we transfer our experience to instances, of which we have no experience, either <i class="calibre10">expressly</i> or <i class="calibre10">tacitly</i>, either <i class="calibre10">directly</i> or <i class="calibre10">indirectly</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">一般来说，我们可以观察到，在所有最成熟和最统一的因果关系中，如重力、冲力、坚固性等，头脑从未明确地考虑过任何过去的经验。虽然在其他更罕见和不寻常的物体关联中，它可以通过这种思考来帮助习惯和观念的转变。但我们发现，在某些情况下，反思产生了信仰，而没有习惯；或者更恰当地说，反思以一种<i class="calibre10">斜</i>的和<i class="calibre10">人为的</i>方式产生了习惯。我自己解释一下。可以肯定的是，不仅在哲学中，甚至在普通生活中，我们都可以通过一次实验来获得对某一特定原因的认识，只要它是经过判断的，并在仔细清除了所有外来和多余的情况之后。现在，经过这样的一次实验，头脑中出现了原因或结果，就可以推断出其相关因素的存在；由于一种习惯不可能仅仅通过一个例子就能获得；人们可能会认为，在这种情况下，信仰不能被视为习惯的结果。但是，如果我们考虑到，虽然我们在这里被认为只有一个特定效果的实验，但是我们有无数个例子来说服我们相信这个原则；<i class="calibre10">相似的物体，放在相似的环境中，总是会产生相似的效果；</i>由于这个原则已经通过足够的习惯建立了自己，它赋予了任何意见以证据和坚定性，它可以被应用于此。观念的联系在一次实验之后并不是习惯性的；但这种联系被包含在另一个原则之下，那就是习惯性的；这使我们回到了我们的假设。在所有情况下，我们都会把我们的经验转移到我们没有经验的实例上，无论是<i class="calibre10">明确的</i>还是默示<i class="calibre10">的</i>，无论是<i class="calibre10">直接</i>的还是<i class="calibre10">间接的</i>。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I must not conclude this subject without observing, that 'tis very difficult to talk of the operations of the mind with perfect propriety and exactness; because common language has seldom made any very nice distinctions among them, but has generally call'd by the same term all such as nearly resemble each other. And as this is a source almost inevitable of obscurity and confusion in the author; so it may frequently give rise to doubts and objections in the reader, which otherwise he wou'd never have dream'd of. Thus my general position, that an opinion or belief is <i class="calibre10">nothing but a strong and lively idea deriv'd from a present impression related to it</i>, may be liable to the following objection, by reason of a little ambiguity in those words <i class="calibre10">strong and lively</i>. It may be said, that not only an impression may give rise to reasoning, but that an idea may also have the same influence; especially upon my principle, <i class="calibre10">that all our ideas are deriv'd from correspondent impressions</i>. For suppose I form at present an idea, of which I have forgot the correspondent impression, I am able to conclude from this idea, that such an impression did once exist; and as this conclusion is attended with belief, it may be ask'd, from whence are the qualities of force and vivacity deriv'd, which constitute this belief? And to this I answer very readily, <i class="calibre10">from the present idea</i>. For as this idea is not here consider'd as the representation of any absent object, but as a real perception in the mind, of which we are intimately conscious, it must be able to bestow on whatever is related to it the same quality, call it <i class="calibre10">firmness</i>, <i class="calibre10">or solidity</i>, <i class="calibre10">or force</i>, <i class="calibre10">or vivacity</i>, with which the mind reflects upon it, and is assur'd of its present existence.

		<p class="block_6 en">I have often observ'd, that, beside cause and effect, the two relations of resemblance and contiguity, are to be consider'd as associating principles of thought, and as capable of conveying the imagination from one idea to another. I have also observ'd, that when of two objects connected together by any of these relations, one is immediately present to the memory or senses, not only the mind is convey'd o its co-relative by means of the associating principle; but likewise conceives it with an additional force and vigour, by the united operation of that principle, and of the present impression. All this I have observ'd, in order to confirm by analogy, my explication of our judgments concerning cause and effect. But this very argument may perhaps, be turn'd against me, and instead of a confirmation of my hypothesis, may become an objection to it. For it may be said, that if all the parts of that hypothesis be true, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> <i class="calibre10">that</i> these three species of relation are deriv'd from the same principles; <i class="calibre10">that</i> their effects in in forcing and inlivening our ideas are the same; and <i class="calibre10">that</i> belief is nothing but a more forcible and vivid conception of an idea; it shou'd follow, that that action of the mind may not only be deriv'd from the relation of cause and effect, but also from those of contiguity and resemblance. But as we find by experience, that belief arises only from causation, and that we can draw no inference from one object to another, except they be corrected by this relation, we may conclude, that there is some error in that reasoning, which leads us into such difficulties.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This is the objection; let us now consider its solution. 'Tis evident, that whatever is present to the memory, striking upon the mind with a vivacity, which resembles an immediate impression, must become of considerable moment in all the operations of the mind, and must easily distinguish itself above the mere fictions of the imagination. Of these impressions or ideas of the memory we form a kind of system, comprehending whatever we remember to have been present, either to our internal perception or senses; and every particular of that system join'd, to the present impressions, we are pleas'd to call a <i class="calibre10">reality</i>. But the mind stops not here. For finding, that with this system of perceptions, there is another connected by custom, or if you will, by the relation of cause or effect, it proceeds to the consideration of their ideas; and as it feels that 'tis in a manner necessarily determin'd to view these particular ideas, and that the custom or relation, by which it is determin'd, admits not of the least change, it forms them into a new system, which it likewise dignifies with the title of <i class="calibre10">realities</i>. The first of these systems is the object of the memory and senses; the second of the judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是反对意见；现在让我们考虑其解决办法。很明显，凡是存在于记忆中的东西，以一种活泼的方式冲击着心灵，类似于一种直接的印象，在心灵的所有活动中必须变得相当重要，而且必须很容易地将自己区别于单纯的想象力的虚构。记忆中的这些印象或想法，我们形成了一种系统，包括我们记忆中的任何东西，无论是对我们的内部感知或感官而言，都是存在的；而这个系统的每一个细节，与现在的印象相结合，我们都乐意称之为<i class="calibre10">现实</i>。但思想并没有在这里停止。因为它发现，在这个感知系统的基础上，还有另一个系统通过习俗，或者如果你愿意的话，通过因果关系联系在一起，它就开始考虑它们的观念；由于它觉得自己在某种程度上必然要看待这些特殊的观念，而它所决定的习俗或关系不允许有任何改变，它就把它们组成一个新的系统，它也同样把这个系统冠以<i class="calibre10">现实</i>的称号。这些系统中的第一个是记忆和感官的对象；第二个是判断的对象。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis this latter principle which peoples the world, and brings us acquainted with such existences, as by their removal in time and place, lie beyond the reach of the senses and memory. By means of it I paint the universe in my imagination, and fix my attention on any part of it I please. I form an idea of Rome, which I neither see nor remember; but which is connected with such impressions as I remember to have received from the conversation and books of travellers and historians. This idea of <i class="calibre10">Rome</i> I place in a certain situation on the idea of an object, which I call the globe. I join to it the conception of a particular government, and religion, and manners. I look backward and consider its first foundation; its several revolutions, successes, and misfortunes. All this, and every thing else, which I believe, are nothing but ideas; tho' by their force and settled order, arising from custom and the relation of cause and effect, they distinguish themselves from the other ideas, which are merely the offspring of the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">正是这后一种原则，让我们认识了世界，并使我们认识了这些存在，因为它们在时间和地点上的差异，是感官和记忆所不能企及的。通过它，我在我的想象中描绘宇宙，并将我的注意力固定在我喜欢的任何部分。我形成了一个罗马的概念，我既没有看到也没有记住；但它与我记得从旅行者和历史学家的谈话和书籍中得到的印象有关。我把这个<i class="calibre10">罗马</i>的概念放在一个物体概念的某个位置上，我称之为地球。我把一个特定的政府、宗教和礼仪的概念与它结合起来。我向后看，考虑它最初的基础；它的几次革命、成功和不幸。所有这一切，以及我所相信的其他一切，都不过是观念；但由于它们的力量和固定的秩序，由习俗和因果关系产生，它们与其他观念不同，后者只是想象力的产物。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">As to the influence of contiguity and resemblance, we may observe, that if the contiguous and resembling object be comprehended in this system of realities, there is no doubt but these two relations will assist that of cause and effect, and infix the related idea with more force in the imagination. This I shall enlarge upon presently. Mean while I shall carry my observation a step farther, and assert, that even where the related object is but feign'd, the relation will serve to enliven the idea, and encrease its influence. A poet, no doubt, will be the better able to form a strong description of the <i class="calibre10">Elysian</i> fields, that he prompts his imagination by the view of a beautiful meadow or garden; as at another time he may by his fancy place himself in the midst of these fabulous regions, that by the feign'd contiguity he may enliven his imagination.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">至于毗连和相似的影响，我们可以注意到，如果毗连和相似的物体被包含在这个现实的系统中，毫无疑问，这两种关系将协助因果关系，并在想象力中注入相关的想法，使其更有力量。这一点我将在下文中详细说明。同时，我将把我的观察再往前推进一步，并断言，即使相关的对象只是假装的，这种关系也将有助于活跃思想，增强其影响力。毫无疑问，如果一个诗人通过欣赏美丽的草地或花园来激发他的想象力，那么他就能更好地形成对<i class="calibre10">极乐世界</i>的强烈描述；就像在另一个时候，他可以通过幻想将自己置于这些神话般的地区之中，通过假装的相邻关系来活跃他的想象力。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' I cannot altogether exclude the relations of resemblance and contiguity from operating on the fancy in this manner, 'tis observable that, when single, their influence is very feeble and uncertain. As the relation of cause and effect is requisite to persuade us of any real existence, so is this persuasion requisite to give force to these other relations. For where upon the appearance of an impression we not only feign another object, but likewise arbitrarily, and of our mere good-will and pleasure give it a particular relation to the impression, this can have but a small effect upon the mind; nor is there any reason, why, upon the return of the same impression, we shou'd be determin'd to place the same object in the same relation to it. There is no manner of necessity for the mind to feign any resembling and contiguous objects; and if it feigns such, there is as little necessity for it always to confine itself to the same, without any difference or variation. And indeed such a fiction is founded on so little reason, that nothing but pure <i class="calibre10">caprice</i> can determine the mind to form it; and that principle being fluctuating and uncertain, 'tis impossible it can ever operate with any considerable degree of force and constancy. The mind forsees and anticipates the change; and even from the very first instant feels the looseness of its actions, and the weak hold it has of its objects. And as this imperfection is very sensible in every single instance, it still encreases by experience and observation, when we compare the several instances we may remember, and form a <i class="calibre10">general rule</i> against the reposing any assurance in those momentary glimpses of light, which arise in the imagination from a feign'd resemblance and contiguity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管我不能完全排除相似性和相邻性的关系以这种方式作用于幻想，但可以看到，在单一的情况下，其影响是非常微弱和不确定的。由于因果关系是说服我们相信任何真实存在的必要条件，这种说服力也是赋予这些其他关系力量的必要条件。因为当一个印象出现时，我们不仅假装另一个物体，而且还任意地，仅仅出于我们的善意和快乐，赋予它与印象的特定关系，这对心灵的影响很小；也没有任何理由，为什么在同一印象返回时，我们会决定将同一物体置于与之相同的关系中。心灵没有必要假装任何相似和相邻的物体；如果它假装如此，它也没有必要总是局限于相同的物体，没有任何区别或变化。事实上，这种虚构是建立在如此少的理由之上的，除了纯粹的<i class="calibre10">任性</i>之外，没有任何东西可以决定心灵的形成；而这种原则是波动的和不确定的，它不可能以任何相当程度的力量和恒定来运作。心灵预见到并预料到这种变化；甚至从一开始就感觉到它的行动的松散性，以及它对它的对象的薄弱控制。由于这种不完美在每一个实例中都是非常明显的，当我们比较我们可能记得的几个实例时，这种不完美仍然在增加，并形成了一个<i class="calibre10">一般的规则</i>，反对在那些瞬间的闪光中寄予任何保证，这些闪光在想象中是由假装的相似性和连续性引起的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The relation of cause and effect has all the opposite advantages. The objects it presents are fixt and unalterable. The impressions of the memory never change in any considerable degree; and each impression draws along with it a precise idea, which takes its place in the imagination, as something solid and real, certain and invariable.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may form a like observation concerning <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>. We have remark'd, that the conclusion, which we draw from a present object to its absent cause or effect, is never founded on any qualities, which we observe in that object, consider'd in itself; or, in other words, that 'tis impossible to determine. otherwise than by experience, what will result from any phænomenon, or what has preceded it. But tho' this be so evident in itself, that it seem'd not to require any proof; yet some philosophers have imagin'd that there is an apparent cause for the communication of motion, and that a reasonable man might immediately infer the motion of one body from the impulse of another, without having recourse to any past observation. That this opinion is false will admit of an easy proof. For if such an inference may be drawn merely from the ideas of body, of motion, and of impulse, it must amount to a demonstration, and must imply the absolute impossibility of any contrary supposition. Every effect, then, beside the communication of motion, implies a formal contradiction; and 'tis impossible not only that it can exist, but also that it can be conceiv'd. But we may soon satisfy ourselves of the contrary, by forming a clear and consistent idea of one body's moving upon another, and of its rest immediately upon the contact; or of its returning back in the same line, in which it came; or of its annihilation; or circular or elliptical motion: and in short, of an infinite number of other changes, which we may suppose it to undergo. These suppositions are all consistent and natural; and the reason, why we imagine the communication of motion to be more consistent and natural not only than those suppositions, but also than any other natural effect, is founded on the relation of <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i> betwixt the cause and effect, which is here united to experience, and binds the objects in the closest and most intimate manner to each other, so as to make us imagine them to be absolutely inseparable. Resemblance, then, has the same or a parallel influence with experience; and as the only immediate effect of experience is to associate our ideas together, it follows, that all belief arises from the association of ideas, according to my hypothesis.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">关于<i class="calibre10">相似性</i>，我们可以形成类似的观察。我们已经说过，我们从一个现在的物体得出的结论，到它不存在的原因或效果，从来都是建立在我们观察到的该物体的任何品质之上，考虑到它本身；或者，换句话说，除了经验之外，不可能确定任何现象会产生什么结果，或者它之前有什么。但是，尽管这本身是如此明显，以至于它似乎不需要任何证明；但一些哲学家想象，运动的交流有一个明显的原因，一个理智的人可以立即从另一个物体的冲动中推断出一个物体的运动，而不必求助于任何过去的观察。这种观点是错误的，这一点很容易得到证明。因为如果这种推论可以仅仅从身体、运动和冲力的概念中得出，它就必须相当于一个证明，并且必须意味着任何相反的假设是绝对不可能的。那么，除了运动的交流之外，每一个效果都意味着形式上的矛盾；不仅它不可能存在，而且它也不可能被设想出来。但是，我们很快就可以通过形成一个清晰而一致的概念，即一个物体在另一个物体上运动，并在接触后立即静止；或按它来时的路线返回；或它的湮灭；或圆周或椭圆运动；以及总之，我们可以假设它经历的无数其他变化。这些假设都是一致的和自然的；而我们为什么认为运动的交流不仅比这些假设更一致和自然，而且比任何其他自然效果更一致和自然，原因是建立在原因和结果之间的<i class="calibre10">相似</i>关系上，这种关系在这里与经验结合在一起，以最紧密和最亲密的方式将对象联系在一起，从而使我们认为它们是绝对不可分割的。那么，相似性与经验具有相同或平行的影响；由于经验的唯一直接效果是将我们的观念联系在一起，因此，根据我的假设，所有的信仰都是由观念的联系产生的。</p></div>

'Tis only by experience that he infers the greatness of the object from some peculiar qualities of the image; and this inference of the judgment he confounds with sensation, as is common on other occasions. Now 'tis evident, that the inference of the judgment is here much more lively than what is usual in our common reasonings, and that a man has a more vivid conception of the vast extent of the ocean from the image he receives by the eye, when he stands on the top of the high promontory, than merely from hearing the roaring of the waters. He feels a more sensible pleasure from its magnificence; which is a proof of a more lively idea: And he confounds his judgment with sensation; which is another proof of it. But as the inference is equally certain and immediate in both cases, this superior vivacity of our conception in one case can proceed from nothing but this, that in drawing an inference from the sight, beside the customary conjunction, there is also a resemblance betwixt the image and the object we infer; which strengthens the relation, and conveys the vivacity of the impression to the related idea with an easier and more natural movement.</p>

When we receive any matter of fact upon human testimony, our faith arises from the very same origin as our inferences from causes to effects, and from effects to causes; nor is there any thing but our <i class="calibre10">experience</i> of the governing principles of human nature, which can give us any assurance of the veracity of men. But tho' experience be the true standard of this, as well as of all other judgments, we seldom regulate ourselves entirely by it; but have a remarkable propensity to believe whatever is reported, even concerning apparitions, enchantments, and prodigies, however contrary to daily experience and observation. The words or discourses of others have an intimate connexion with certain ideas in their mind; and these ideas have also a connexion with the facts or objects, which they represent. This latter connexion is generally much over-rated, and commands our assent beyond what experience will justify; which can proceed from nothing beside the resemblance betwixt the ideas and the facts. Other effects only point out their causes in an oblique manner; but the testimony of men does it directly, and is to be consider'd as an image as well as an effect. No wonder, therefore, we are so rash in drawing our inferences from it, and are less guided by experience in our judgments concerning it, than in those upon any other subject.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">As resemblance, when conjoin'd with causation, fortifies our reasonings; so the want of it in any very great degree is able almost entirely to destroy them. Of this there is a remarkable instance in the universal carelessness and stupidity of men with regard to a future state, where they show as obstinate an incredulity, as they do a blind credulity on other occasions. There is not indeed a more ample matter of wonder to the studious, and of regret to the pious man, than to observe the negligence of the bulk of mankind concerning their approaching condition; and 'tis with reason, that many eminent theologians have not scrupled to affirm, that tho' the vulgar have no formal principles of infidelity, yet they are really infidels in their hearts, and have nothing like what we can call a belief of the eternal duration of their souls. For let us consider on the one hand what divines have display'd with such eloquence concerning the importance of eternity; and at the same time reflect, that tho' in matters of rhetoric we ought to lay our account with some exaggeration, we must in this case allow, that the strongest figures are infinitely inferior to the subject: And after this let us view on the other hand the prodigious security of men in this particular: I ask, if these people really believe what is inculcated on them, and what they pretend to affirm; and the answer is obviously in the negative. As belief is an act of the mind arising from custom, 'tis not strange the want of resemblance shou'd overthrow what custom has establish'd, and diminish the force of the idea, as much as that latter principle encreases it. A future state is so far remov'd from our comprehension, and we have so obscure an idea of the manner, in which we shall exist after the dissolution of the body, that all the reasons we can invent, however strong in themselves, and however much assisted by education, are never able with slow imaginations to surmount this difficulty, or bestow a sufficient authority and force on the idea. I rather choose to ascribe this incredulity to the faint idea we form of our future condition, deriv'd from its want of resemblance to the present life, than to that deriv'd from its remoteness. For I observe, that men are every where concern'd about what may happen after their death, provided it regard this world; and that there are few to whom their name, their family, their friends, and their country are in any period of time entirely indifferent.</p>

This appears very conspicuously wherever men have occasion to compare the pleasures and pains, the rewards and punishments of this life with those of a future; even tho' the case does not concern themselves, and there is no violent passion to disturb their judgment.

They may either appear in impression to the actual feeling, or only in idea, as at present when I mention them. 'Tis evident the induence of these upon our actions is far from being equal. Impressions always actuate the soul, and that in the highest degree; but 'tis not every idea which has the same efect. Nature has proceeded with caution in this case, and seems to have carefully avoided the inconveniences of two extremes. Did impressions alone influence the will, we should every moment of our lives be subject to the greatest calamities; because, tho' we foresaw their approach, we should not be provided by nature with any principle of action, which might impel us to avoid them. On the other hand, did every idea influence our actions, our condition would not be much mended.

Tho' an idle fiction has no efficacy, yet we find by experience, that the ideas of those objects, which we believe either are or will be existent, produce in a lesser degree the same effect with those impressions, which are immediately present to the senses and perception. The effect, then, of belief is to raise up a simple idea to an equality with our impressions, and bestow on it a like influence on the passions. This effect it can only have by making an idea approach an impression in force and vivacity. For as the different degrees of force make all the original difference betwixt an impression and an idea, they must of consequence be the source of all the differences in the effects of these perceptions, and their removal, in whole or in part, the cause of every new resemblance they acquire. Wherever we can make an idea approach the impressions in force and vivacity, it will likewise imitate them in its influence on the mind; and <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i>, where it imitates them in that influence, as in the present case, this must proceed from its approaching them in force and vivacity. Belief, therefore, since it causes an idea to imitate the effects of the impressions, must make it resemble them in these qualities, and is nothing but <i class="calibre10">a more</i> <i class="calibre10">vivid and intense conception of any idea</i>.

		<p class="block_6 en">As belief is almost absolutely requisite to the exciting our passions, so the passions in their turn are very favourable to belief; and not only such facts as convey agreeable emotions, but very often such as give pain, do upon that account become more readily the objects of faith and opinion. A coward, whose fears are easily awaken'd, readily assents to every account of danger he meets with; as a person of a sorrowful and melancholy disposition is very credulous of every thing, that nourishes his prevailing passion. When any affecting object is presented, it gives the alarm, and excites immediately a degree of its proper passion; especially in persons who are naturally inclined to that passion. This emotion passes by an easy transition to the imagination; and diffusing itself over our idea of the affecting object, makes us form that idea with greater force and vivacity, and consequently assent to it, according to the precedent system. Admiration and surprize have the same effect as the other passions; and accordingly we may observe, that among the vulgar, quacks and projectors meet with a more easy faith upon account of their magnificent pretensions, than if they kept themselves within the bounds of moderation. The first astonishment, which naturally attends their miraculous relations, spreads itself over the whole soul, and so vivifies and enlivens the idea, that it resembles the inferences we draw from experience. This is a mystery, with which we may be already a little acquainted, and which we shall have farther occasion to be let into in the progress of this treatise.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由于信仰对于激发我们的激情几乎是绝对必要的，所以激情反过来也非常有利于信仰；不仅是那些传递令人愉快的情绪的事实，而且往往是那些给人带来痛苦的事实，因此更容易成为信仰和意见的对象。一个懦夫，他的恐惧很容易被唤醒，很容易同意他遇到的每一个关于危险的说法；就像一个性格忧郁的人对每一件滋养他的激情的事情都非常相信。当任何有影响的物体出现时，它就会发出警报，并立即激起某种程度的适当激情；尤其是在那些天生就有这种激情的人身上。这种情绪很容易过渡到想象力；并扩散到我们对影响对象的想法上，使我们以更大的力量和活力形成这种想法，并因此根据先例系统对它表示赞同。钦佩和惊奇与其他激情有同样的效果；因此我们可以看到，在庸俗的人中，庸医和预测者因其华丽的装腔作势而更容易得到人们的信任，而如果他们把自己保持在适度的范围内的话。自然而然地伴随着他们的神奇关系的第一份惊奇，遍布整个灵魂，并如此生动和活泼的想法，它类似于我们从经验中得出的推论。这是一个奥秘，我们可能已经有点了解了，在本论文的进展中，我们将有更多的机会了解它。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">After this account of the influence of belief on the passions, we shall find less difficulty in explaining its effects on the imagination, however extraordinary they may appear. 'Tis certain we cannot take pleasure in any discourse, where our judgment gives no assent to those images which are presented to our fancy. The conversation of those, who have acquir'd a habit of lying, tho' in affairs of no moment, never gives any satisfaction; and that because those ideas they present to us, not being attended with belief, make no impression upon the mind. Poets themselves, tho' liars by profession, always endeavour to give an air of truth to their fictions; and where that is totally neglected, their performances, however ingenious, will never be able to afford much pleasure. In short, we may observe, that even when ideas have no manner of influence on the will and passions, truth and reality are still requisite, in order to make them entertaining to the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在说明了信仰对激情的影响之后，我们将发现在解释它对想象力的影响时就不那么困难了，无论它们看起来多么不寻常。可以肯定的是，如果我们的判断力不同意呈现在我们想象中的那些图像，我们就无法在任何谈话中获得快乐。那些已经养成说谎习惯的人的谈话，尽管在无关紧要的事情上，也不会让人感到满意；这是因为他们呈现给我们的那些想法，并不带有信仰，不会在头脑中留下印象。诗人自己，虽然以说谎为职业，但总是努力使他们的虚构有一种真实感；如果完全忽略了这一点，他们的表演，无论多么巧妙，都不会给人带来多少乐趣。总之，我们可以看到，即使思想对意志和激情没有任何影响，真实和现实仍然是必要的，以便使它们对想象力具有娱乐性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But if we compare together all the phænomena that occur on this head, we shall find, that truth, however necessary it may seem in all works of genius, has no other effect than to procure an easy reception for the ideas, and to make the mind acquiesce in them with satisfaction, or at least without reluctance. But as this is an effect, which may easily be supposed to flow from that solidity and force, which, according to my system, attend those ideas that are establish'd by reasonings from causation; it follows, that all the influence of belief upon the fancy may be explained from that system. Accordingly we may observe, that wherever that influence arises from any other principles beside truth or reality, they supply its place, and give an equal entertainment to the imagination. Poets have form'd what they call a poetical system of things, which tho' it be believ'd neither by themselves nor readers, is commonly esteem'd a sufficient foundation for any fiction. We have been so much accustom'd to the names of Mars, Jupiter, Venus, that in the same manner as education infixes any opinion, the constant repetition of these ideas makes them enter into the mind ith facility, and prevail upon the fancy, without influencing the judgment. In like manner tragedians always borrow their fable, or at least the names of their principal actors, from some known passage in history; and that not in order to deceive the spectators; for they will frankly confess, that truth is not in any circumstance inviolably observed; but in order to procure a more easy reception into the imagination for those extraordinary events, which they represent. But this is a precaution, which is not required of comic poets, whose personages and incidents, being of a more familiar kind, enter easily into the conception, and are received without any such formality, even tho' at first sight they be known to be fictitious, and the pure offspring of the fancy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，如果我们把发生在这个问题上的所有现象放在一起比较，我们就会发现，无论真理在所有天才作品中是多么必要，它的作用也不过是为了使思想容易被接受，并使头脑满意地或至少不勉强地默认它们。但是，既然这是一种效果，就很容易被认为是来自于那种稳固性和力量，而根据我的体系，这种稳固性和力量是伴随着那些通过因果关系的推理而确立的观念的；因此，信仰对幻想的所有影响都可以从这个体系中得到解释。因此，我们可以看到，凡是这种影响来自真理或现实之外的任何其他原则，它们都能提供其位置，并给想象力以同样的娱乐。诗人已经形成了他们所谓的诗意的事物体系，虽然他们自己和读者都不相信，但普遍认为这是任何虚构的充分基础。我们已经习惯了火星、木星、金星的名字，就像教育为任何观点打上标签一样，这些想法的不断重复使它们顺利地进入大脑，并在幻想中占上风，而不影响判断。同样，悲剧演员总是从历史上的某些已知段落中借用他们的寓言，或者至少借用他们的主要演员的名字；这并不是为了欺骗观众；因为他们会坦率地承认，在任何情况下，真理都不是不可侵犯的；而是为了使他们所表现的那些特殊事件更容易被想象力接受。但这是一种预防措施，喜剧诗人不需要这样做，他们的人物和事件都是比较熟悉的，很容易进入人们的概念，不需要任何形式就能接受，即使一开始就知道是虚构的，是纯粹的幻想的产物。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This mixture of truth and falshood in the fables of tragic poets not only serves our present purpose, by shewing, that the imagination can be satisfy'd without any absolute belief or assurance; but may in another view be regarded as a very strong confirmation of this system. 'Tis evident, that poets make use of this artifice of borrowing the names of their persons, and the chief events of their poems, from history, in order to procure a more easy reception for the whole, and cause it to make a deeper impression on the fancy and affections. The several incidents of the piece acquire a kind of relation by being united into one poem or representation; and if any of these incidents be an object of belief, it bestows a force and vivacity on the others, which are related to it. The vividness of the first conception diffuses itself along the relations, and is convey'd, as by so many pipes or canals, to every idea that has any communication with the primary one. This, indeed, can never amount to a perfect assurance; and that because the union among the ideas is, in a manner, accidental: But still it approaches so near, in its influence, as may convince us, that they are deriv'd from the same origin. Belief must please the imagination by means of the force and vivacity which attends it; since every idea, which has force and vivacity, is found to be agreeable to that faculty.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">悲剧诗人的寓言中这种真假混杂的现象，不仅有助于我们目前的目的，说明想象力可以在没有任何绝对信仰或保证的情况下得到满足；而且从另一个角度看，可以被视为对这一制度的有力证实。很明显，诗人利用了这种从历史中借用他们的人名和他们诗歌中的主要事件的伎俩，以便使整个作品更容易被接受，并使其在想象力和情感上留下更深刻的印象。作品中的几个事件通过结合成一首诗或表现形式而获得一种关系；如果这些事件中的任何一个是信仰的对象，它就会给与它有关的其他事件带来一种力量和活力。第一个概念的生动性沿着这些关系扩散开来，并像通过许多管道或运河一样，被输送到与主要概念有任何联系的每一个概念。这的确不可能达到完美的保证；这是因为观念之间的结合在某种程度上是偶然的：但它的影响仍然如此接近，以至于可以使我们相信，它们是来自同一源头的。信仰必须通过伴随它的力量和活力来取悦想象力；因为每一个有力量和活力的观念都会被发现是符合这种能力的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this we may observe, that the assistance is mutual betwixt the judgment and fancy, as well as betwixt the judgment and passion; and that belief not only gives vigour to the imagination, but that a vigorous and strong imagination is of all talents the most proper to procure belief and authority. 'Tis difficult for us to withold our assent from what is painted out to us in all the colours of eloquence; and the vivacity produc'd by the fancy is in many cases greater than that which arises from custom and experience. We are hurried away by the lively imagination of our author or companion; and even he himself is often a victim to his own fire and genius.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证实这一点，我们可以观察到，判断力和想象力之间的协助，以及判断力和激情之间的协助是相互的；信仰不仅给想象力带来活力，而且一个充满活力和强大的想象力是所有才能中最适合获得信仰和权威的。我们很难不同意那些以各种雄辩的色彩向我们展示的东西；在许多情况下，想象力所产生的活力比从习俗和经验中产生的活力更大。我们被我们的作者或同伴的生动的想象力所驱使；甚至他自己也常常是他自己的火焰和天才的受害者。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor will it be amiss to remark, that as a lively imagination very often degenerates into madness or folly, and bears it a great resemblance in its operations; so they influence the judgment after the same manner, and produce belief from the very same principles. When the imagination, from any extraordinary ferment of the blood and spirits, acquires such a vivacity as disorders all its powers and faculties, there is no means of distinguishing betwixt truth and falshood; but every loose fiction or idea, having the same influence as the impressions of the memory, or the conclusions of the judgment, is receiv'd on the same footing, and operates with equal force on the passions. A present impression and a customary transition are now no longer necessary to inliven our ideas. Every chimera of the brain is as vivid and intense as any of those inferences, which we formerly dignify'd with the name of conclusions concerning matters of fact, and sometimes as the present impressions of the senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们也可以说，由于活泼的想象力经常退化为疯狂或愚蠢，并且在其运作中与之非常相似；所以它们以同样的方式影响判断力，并从同样的原则产生信仰。当想象力因血液和精神的异常发酵而获得如此的活力，使其所有的力量和能力失调时，就没有办法区分真理和谬误；但每一个松散的虚构或想法，都具有与记忆的印象或判断的结论相同的影响，都在同样的基础上被接受，并以同样的力量作用于激情。现在，为了活跃我们的思想，已经不再需要现有的印象和习惯性的过渡。大脑的每一个幻觉都和那些推论一样生动和强烈，我们以前把这些推论冠以关于事实问题的结论之名，有时还冠以感官的现有印象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may observe the same effect of poetry in a lesser degree; only with this difference, that the least reflection dissipates the illusions of poetry, and places the objects in their proper light. 'Tis however certain, that in the warmth of a poetical enthusiasm, a poet has a counterfeit belief, and even a kind of vision of his objects: And if there be any shadow of argument to support this belief; nothing contributes more to his full conviction than a blaze of poetical figures and images, which have their effect upon the poet himself, as well as upon his readers.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以在较小的程度上观察到诗歌的相同效果；只是有一点不同，那就是最起码的反思会驱散诗歌的幻觉，并将对象置于其适当的光线中。然而，可以肯定的是，在诗歌的热情中，诗人有一种虚假的信念，甚至对他的对象有一种幻觉。如果有任何论据支持这种信念，那么没有什么比诗意的数字和图像的光芒更有助于他的充分信念，这些数字和图像对诗人本人和他的读者都有影响。</p></div>

But tho' every one be free to use his terms in what sense he pleases; and accordingly in the precedent part of this discourse, I have follow'd this method of expression; 'tis however certain, that in common discourse we readily affirm, that many arguments from causation exceed probability, and may be receiv'd as a superior kind of evidence. One wou'd appear ridiculous, who wou'd say, that 'tis only probable the sun will rise to-morrow, or that all men must dye; tho' 'tis plain we have no further assurance of these facts, than what experience affords us. For this reason, 'twould perhaps be more convenient, in order at once to preserve the common signification of words, and mark the several degrees of evidence, to distinguish human reason into three kinds, viz. <i class="calibre10">that from knowledge, from proofs, and from probabilities</i>. By knowledge, I mean the assurance arising from the comparison of ideas. By proofs, those arguments, which are deriv'd from the relation of cause and effect, and which are entirely free from doubt and uncertainty.

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The idea of cause and effect is deriv'd from experience, which presenting us with certain objects constantly conjoin'd with each other, produces such a habit of surveying them in that relation, that we cannot without a sensible violence survey them in any other. On the other hand, as chance is nothing real in itself; and, properly speaking, is merely the negation of a cause, its influence on the mind is contrary to that of causation; and 'tis essential to it, to leave the imagination perfectly indifferent, either to consider the existence or non-existence of that object, which is regarded as contingent. A cause traces the way to our thought, and in a manner forces us to survey such certain objects, in such certain relations. Chance can only destroy this determination of the thought, and leave the mind in its native situation of indifference; in which, upon the absence of a cause, 'tis instantly re-instated.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因果关系的概念是由经验派生出来的，它使我们看到某些物体不断地相互联系，产生了在这种关系中观察它们的习惯，以至于我们不能不以一种感觉上的暴力来观察它们的任何其他关系。另一方面，由于偶然性本身并不真实；正确地说，它只是对原因的否定，它对心灵的影响与因果关系相反；对它来说，让想象力完全无动于衷，要么考虑那个被视为偶然的对象的存在或不存在，是至关重要的。一个原因为我们的思想指明了方向，并以某种方式迫使我们在这种特定的关系中考察这种特定的对象。偶然性只能破坏思想的这种决定性，并使思想处于其原始的冷漠状态；在这种情况下，一旦没有原因，就会立即重新恢复过来。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Since therefore an entire indifference is essential to chance, no one chance can possibly be superior to another, otherwise than as it is compos'd of a superior number of equal chances. For if we affirm that one chance can, after any other manner, be superior to another, we must at the same time affirm, that there is something, which gives it the superiority, and determines the event rather to that side than the other: That is, in other words, we must allow of a cause, and destroy the supposition of chance; which we had before establish'd. A perfect and total indifference is essential to chance, and one total indifference can never in itself be either superior or inferior to another. This truth is not peculiar to my system, but is acknowledge'd by every one, that forms calculations concerning chances.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，既然整个冷漠对机会来说是必不可少的，那么没有一个机会可能优于另一个，除非它是由数量众多的同等机会组成的。因为如果我们确认一个机会可以以任何其他方式优于另一个机会，我们就必须同时确认，有某种东西赋予它优势，并决定了事件宁可偏向那一方而不是另一方。也就是说，换句话说，我们必须允许有一个原因，并破坏我们之前建立的关于机会的假设。一个完美的、完全的冷漠对机会来说是必不可少的，而一个完全的冷漠本身永远不会比另一个冷漠优越或低劣。这一真理并不是我的体系所特有的，而是每个人都承认的，因为他们对机会进行了计算。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">And here 'tis remarkable, that tho' chance and causation be directly contrary, yet 'tis impossible for us to conceive this combination of chances, which is requisite to render one hazard superior to another, without supposing a mixture of causes among the chances, and a conjunction of necessity in some particulars, with a total indifference in others. Where nothing limits the chances, every notion, that the most extravagant fancy can form, is upon a footing of equality; nor can there be any circumstance to give one the advantage above another. Thus unless we allow, that there are some causes to make the dice fall, and preserve their form in their fall, and lie upon some one of their sides, we can form no calculation concerning the laws of hazard. But supposing these causes to operate, and supposing likewise all the rest to be indifferent and to be determin'd by chance, 'tis easy to arrive at a notion of a superior combination of chances. A dye, that has four sides mark'd with a certain number of spots, and only two with another, affords us an obvious and easy instance of this superiority. The mind is here limited by the causes to such a precise number and quality of the events; and at the same time is undetermin'd in its choice of any particular event.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这里值得注意的是，尽管机会和因果关系是直接相反的，但我们不可能设想这种机会的组合，这是使一种危险优于另一种危险所必需的，而不需要假定机会中的原因混合，以及在某些特定情况下的必然性与其他情况下的完全漠不关心。在没有任何限制机会的地方，最奢侈的幻想所能形成的每一个概念都是建立在平等的基础上的；也不可能有任何情况使一个人比另一个人更有优势。因此，除非我们允许有一些原因使骰子落下，并在落下的过程中保持其形状，且位于其中的某一面，否则我们就无法计算出危险的规律。但是，假设这些原因在起作用，同时假设所有其他的原因都是无所谓的，都是由机会决定的，那么就很容易得出一个关于机会的卓越组合的概念。一块染料，四面有一定数量的斑点，而只有两面有另一种斑点，为我们提供了这种优越性的一个明显而容易的例子。在这里，思想被原因限制在事件的精确数量和质量上；同时，在选择任何特定事件时也是不确定的。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Proceeding then in that reasoning, wherein we have advanc'd three steps; <i class="calibre10">that</i> chance is merely the negation of a cause, and produces a total indifference in the mind; <i class="calibre10">that</i> one negation of a cause and one total indifference can never be superior or inferior to another; and <i class="calibre10">that</i> there must always be a mixture of causes among the chances, in order to be the foundation of any reasoning: We are next to consider what effect a superior combination of chances can have upon the mind, and after what manner it influences our judgment and opinion. Here we may repeat all the same arguments we employ'd in examining that belief, which arises from causes; and may prove after the same manner, that a superior number of chances produces our assent neither by <i class="calibre10">demonstration</i> nor <i class="calibre10">probability</i>. 'Tis indeed evident, that we can never by the comparison of mere ideas make any discovery, which can be of consequence in this affair, and that 'tis impossible to prove with certainty, that any event must fall on that side where there is a superior number of chances. To suppose in this case any certainty, were to overthrow what we have establish'd concerning the opposition of chances, and their perfect equality and indifference.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">然后继续推理，其中我们已经推进了三个步骤；机会只是对一个原因的否定，并在头脑中产生一种完全的冷漠；对一个原因的否定和一种完全的冷漠永远不可能优于或劣于另一个<i class="calibre10">原因</i>；在机会中必须始终有一个混合的原因，以便成为任何推理的基础。我们接下来要考虑的是，机会的高级组合会对人的思想产生什么影响，以及它以何种方式影响我们的判断和意见。在这里，我们可以重复所有我们在研究由原因产生的信念时所使用的相同论据；并且可以以同样的方式证明，机会的数量越多，就越不能通过<i class="calibre10">证明</i>或<i class="calibre10">概率</i>来产生我们的同意。这的确很明显，我们永远无法通过单纯的观念比较来做出任何发现，这在这件事上是有意义的，而且不可能肯定地证明，任何事件都必须落在机会较多的那一方。在这种情况下，假设有任何确定性，就等于推翻了我们所确立的关于机会的对立，以及它们的完全平等和冷漠。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Shou'd it be said, that tho' in an opposition or chances 'tis impossible to determine with <i class="calibre10">certainty</i>, on which side the event will fall, yet we can pronounce with certainty, that 'tis more likely and probable, 'twill be on that side where there is a superior number of chances, than where there is an inferior: Shou'd this be said, I wou'd ask, what is here meant by <i class="calibre10">likelihood and probability?</i> The likelihood and probability of chances is a superior number of equal chances; and consequently when we say 'tis likely the event will fall on the side, which is superior, rather than on the inferior, we do no more than affirm, that where there is a superior number of chances there is actually a superior, and where there is an inferior there is an inferior; which are identical propositions, and of no consequence. The question is, by what means a superior number of equal chances operates upon the mind, and produces belief or assent; since it appears, that 'tis neither by arguments deriv'd from demonstration, nor from probability.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">是否可以这样说，虽然在一个对立或机会中，我们不可能<i class="calibre10">确定</i>事件将落在哪一边，但我们可以肯定地宣布，“更有可能、更有可能的是，机会多的那一边将比机会少的那一边更有可能出现。既然这样说，我想问，这里的<i class="calibre10">可能性和概率</i>是什么意思<i class="calibre10">？</i>机会的可能性和概率是指同等机会的优势数量；因此，当我们说” 事件有可能落在优势的一方，而不是落在劣势的一方 "时，我们不过是确认，有优势数量的地方实际上就有优势，有劣势的地方就有劣势；这是相同的命题，没有任何意义。问题是，同等机会的上等数量是通过什么方式作用于人的心灵，并产生信仰或同意；因为看来，这既不是通过证明的论据，也不是通过概率的论据。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了弄清这个难题，我们要假设一个人拿着一种染料，它的四条边上刻着一个图形，或一个数目的斑点，两条边上刻着另一个图形；然后把这种染料放进盒子里，打算把它扔出去。很明显，他必须断定一个图形比另一个图形更有可能，并优先考虑刻在最多边上的那个图形。在某种程度上，他相信这个图形会在最上面；尽管他仍然犹豫不决，怀疑与相反的机会的数量成正比。当这些相反的机会减少，而另一边的优势增加时，他的信念就获得了新的稳定和保证。这种信念来自于对我们面前这个简单而有限的对象的思维运作；因此，它的性质将更容易被发现和解释。为了理解理解力最奇特的操作之一，我们只需考虑一个单一的染料就可以了。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This dye form'd as above, contains three circumstances worthy of our attention. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, Certain causes, such as gravity, solidity, a. cubical figure, <i class="calibre10">&amp;c.</i> which determine it to fall, to preserve its form in its fall, and to turn up one of its sides. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, A certain number of sides, which are suppos'd indifferent. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, A certain figure, inscrib'd on each side. These three particulars form the whole nature of the dye, so far as relates to our present purpose; and consequently are the only circumstances regarded by the mind in its forming a judgment concerning the result of such a throw.

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如上所述，这个染料的形状包含了三个值得我们注意的情况。<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，某些原因，如重力、坚固性、立方体<i class="calibre10">等</i>，决定了它会坠落，在坠落过程中保持其形状，并翻起其中的一个面。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，有一定数量的边，这些边被认为是无所谓的。<i class="calibre10">第三</i>，每个面都刻有某种图形。这三个细节构成了染料的全部性质，只要与我们目前的目的有关；因此，这也是人们在对这种投掷的结果作出判断时唯一考虑的情况。因此，让我们逐步仔细考虑这些情况对思想和想象力的影响是什么。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, We have already observ'd, that the mind is determin'd by custom to pass from any cause to its effect, and that upon the appearance of the one, 'tis almost impossible for it not to form an idea of the other. Their constant conjunction in past instances has produc'd such a habit in the mind, that it always conjoins them in its thought, and infers the existence of the one from that of its usual attendant. When it considers the dye as no longer supported by the box, it cannot without violence regard it as suspended in the air; but naturally places it on the table, and views it as turning up one of its sides. This is the effect of the intermingled causes, which are requisite to our forming any calculation concerning chances.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们已经注意到，人们的思想是由习惯决定的，从任何原因到它的结果，一旦出现一个，几乎不可能不形成另一个的想法。在过去的例子中，它们不断地结合在一起，在头脑中形成了这样一种习惯，以至于它总是把它们连在一起思考，并从其通常的伴随者推断出一个人的存在。当它认为染料不再由盒子支撑时，它就不能不认为它是悬浮在空气中的；而是自然地把它放在桌子上，把它看成是翻开它的一个面。这就是混合原因的结果，这对我们形成任何有关机会的计算都是必要的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, 'Tis suppos'd, that tho' the dye be necessarily determin'd to fall, and turn up one of its sides, yet there is nothing to fix the particular side, but that this is determin'd entirely by chance. The very nature and essence of chance is a negation of causes, and the leaving the mind in a perfect indifference among those events, which are suppos'd contingent. When therefore the thought is determin'd by the causes to consider the dye as falling and turning up one of its sides, the chances present all these sides as equal, and make us consider every one of them, one after another, as alike probable and possible. The imagination passes from the cause, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the throwing of the dye, to the effect, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the turning up one of the six sides; and feels a kind of impossibility both of stopping short in the way, and of forming any other idea. But as all these six sides are incompatible, and the dye cannot turn up above one at once, this principle directs us not to consider all of them at once as lying uppermost; which we look upon as impossible: Neither does it direct us with its entire force to any particular side; for in that case this side wou'd be consider'd as certain and inevitable; but it directs us to the whole six sides after such a manner as to divide its force equally among them. We conclude in general, that some one of them must result from the throw: We run all of them over in our minds: The determination of the thought is common to all; but no more of its force falls to the share of any one, than what is suitable to its proportion with the rest. 'Tis after this manner the original impulse, and consequently the vivacity of thought, arising from the causes, is divided and split in pieces by the intermingled chances.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">其次，我们认为，尽管染料必然会落下，并翻起其中一面，但没有任何东西可以固定特定的一面，而这完全是由机会决定的。机会的性质和本质是对原因的否定，并使思想在那些被认为是偶然的事件中处于完全的冷漠状态。因此，当思想被原因所决定，认为染料落下并翻起它的一个面时，机会把所有这些面都呈现为平等的，并使我们把它们中的每一个，一个接一个，视为同样的可能和可能。想象力从原因（<i class="calibre10">即</i>染料的投掷）到结果（<i class="calibre10">即</i>六面中的一面翻起）；并感到一种不可能，既不可能在路上停下来，也不可能形成任何其他想法。但是，由于所有这六个面都是不相容的，而且染料不可能一下子翻到一个以上，这个原则指导我们不要一下子把所有的面都看成是最上面的；我们认为这是不可能的。它也没有把它的全部力量指向任何一个特定的面；因为在这种情况下，这个面会被认为是确定的和不可避免的；但它指导我们以这样一种方式将它的力量平均分配到整个六面。总的来说，我们得出的结论是，其中的某一个必须是投掷的结果。我们在脑海中反复思考所有这些问题。思想的决定是共同的；但它的力量除了适合于它与其他部分的比例之外，没有更多的力量属于任何一个人的份额。就是这样，最初的冲动，以及由此产生的思想的活力，从各种原因中产生，被混合的机会分割成碎片。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We have already seen the influence of the two first qualities of the dye, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">causes</i>, and the <i class="calibre10">number</i> and <i class="calibre10">indifference</i> of the sides, and have learn'd how they give an impulse to the thought, and divide that impulse into as many parts as there are unites in the number of sides. We must now consider the effects of the third particular, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">figures</i> inscrib'd on each side. 'Tis evident that where several sides have the same figure inscrib'd on them, they must concur in their influence on the mind, and must unite upon one image or idea of a figure all those divided impulses, that were dispers'd over the several sides, upon which that figure is inscrib'd. Were the question only what side will be turn'd up, these are all perfectly equal, and no one cou'd ever have any advantage above another. But as the question is concerning the figure, and as the same figure is presented by more than one side; 'tis evident, that the impulses belonging to all these sides must re-unite in that one figure, and become stronger and more forcible by the union. Four sides are suppos'd in the present case to have the same figure inscrib'd on them, and two to have another figure. The impulses of the former are, therefore, superior to those of the latter. But as the events are contrary, and 'tis impossible both these figures can be turn'd up; the impulses likewise become contrary, and the inferior destroys the superior, as far as its strength goes. The vivacity of the idea is always proportionable to the degrees of the impulse or tendency to the transition; and belief is the same with the vivacity of the idea, according to the precedent doctrine.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们已经看到了染料的前两个特质的影响，<i class="calibre10">即</i> <i class="calibre10">原因</i>以及边的<i class="calibre10">数量</i>和<i class="calibre10">冷漠</i>，并且已经了解到它们是如何给思想带来冲动，并将这种冲动分成与边的数量相同的多个部分。我们现在必须考虑第三种情况的影响，<i class="calibre10">即</i>每条边上所刻的<i class="calibre10">数字</i>。很明显，如果几个面都刻有相同的图形，它们对心灵的影响必然是一致的，而且必须把所有分散在几个面上的、刻有该图形的、分裂的冲动统一到一个图形的形象或概念上。如果问题仅仅是哪一面会被翻起，那么这些都是完全平等的，没有任何一方会比另一方有任何优势。但是，由于问题是关于图形的，而同一个图形是由多个面来呈现的；显然，属于所有这些面的冲动必须在这一个图形中重新结合，并通过结合变得更加强大和有力。在本例中，有四个面被假定为刻有同一个图形，有两个面被假定为另一个图形。因此，前者的冲动优于后者的冲动。但是，由于事件是相反的，而且这两个图形不可能被翻转起来；冲动也同样变得相反，而且就其力量而言，劣等的破坏了高等的。思想的活力总是与过渡时期的冲动或倾向的程度成比例；根据先例学说，信仰与思想的活力是一样的。</p></div>

'Tis true, nothing is more common than for people of the most advanc'd knowledge to have attain'd only an imperfect experience of many particular events; which naturally produces only an imperfect habit and transition: But then we must consider, that the mind, having form'd another observation concerning the connexion of causes and effects, gives new force to its reasoning from that observation; and by means of it can build an argument on one single experiment, when duly prepar'd and examin'd. What we have found once to follow from any object, we conclude will for ever follow from it; and if this maxim be not always built upon as certain, 'tis not for want of a sufficient number of experiments, but because we frequently meet with instances to the contrary; which leads us to the second species of probability, where there is a <i class="calibre10">contrariety</i> in our experience and observation.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Twou'd be very happy for men in the conduct of their lives and actions, were the same objects always conjoin'd together, and we had nothing to fear but the mistakes of our own judgment, without having any reason to apprehend the uncertainty of nature. But as 'tis frequently found, that one observation is contrary to another, and that causes and effects follow not in the same order, of which we have had experience, we are oblig'd to vary our reasoning on account of this uncertainty, and take into consideration the contrariety of events. The first question, that occurs on this head, is concerning the nature and causes of the contrariety.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The vulgar, who take things according to their first appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes, as makes them often fail of their usual influence, tho' they meet with no obstacle nor impediment in their operation. But philosophers observing, that almost in every part of nature there is contain'd a vast variety of springs and principles, which are hid, by reason of their minuteness or remoteness, find that 'tis at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause, but from the secret operation of contrary causes. This possibility is converted into certainty by farther observation, when they remark, that upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of causes, and proceeds from their mutual hindrance and opposition. A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say, that commonly it does not go right: But an artizan easily perceives, that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same influence on the wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of dust, which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of several parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim, that the connexion betwixt all causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary causes.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">俗人根据事物的最初表象，把事件的不确定性归因于原因的不确定性，使它们经常不能发挥其通常的影响，尽管它们在运行中没有遇到任何障碍或阻碍。但哲学家们观察到，自然界的每一个部分几乎都包含着各种各样的源泉和原理，由于它们的微小或遥远而被隐藏起来，他们发现，"事件的反常性至少有可能不是来自原因中的任何偶然性，而是来自相反原因的秘密运作。这种可能性通过进一步的观察转化为确定性，当他们指出，经过精确的检查，结果的反差总是暴露了原因的反差，并且来自它们的相互阻碍和反对。一个农民对于任何时钟或手表的停顿，除了说它通常走得不对之外，没有更好的理由。但是，一个艺术家很容易看出，弹簧或钟摆中的相同力量对轮子的影响始终是相同的；但由于一粒灰尘的存在，使整个运动停顿下来，从而失去了其通常的效果。哲学家们从对几个平行例子的观察中形成了一条格言，即所有的原因和结果之间的联系都是同样必要的，而在某些情况下，其看似不确定的原因是由于相反的原因的秘密对抗。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But however philosophers and the vulgar may differ in their explication of the contrariety of events, their inferences from it are always of the same kind, and founded on the same principles. A contrariety of events in the past may give us a kind of hesitating belief for the future after two several ways. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, By producing an imperfect habit and transition from the present impression to the related idea. When the conjunction of any two objects is frequent, without being entirely constant, the mind is determin'd to pass from one object to the other; but not with so entire a habit, as when the union is uninterrupted, and all the instances we have ever met with are uniform and of a piece. We End from common experience, in our actions as well as reasonings, that a constant perseverance in any course of life produces a strong inclination and tendency to continue for the future; tho' there are habits of inferior degrees of force, proportion'd to the inferior degrees of steadiness and uniformity in our conduct.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，无论哲学家和普通人在解释事件的反差方面如何不同，他们从中得出的推论总是同类的，并建立在相同的原则之上。过去事件的反差可以通过两种方式给我们一种对未来的犹豫不决的信念。<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，通过产生一种不完美的习惯和过渡，从现在的印象到相关的想法。当任何两个对象的结合是频繁的，而不是完全恒定的，头脑就会被确定为从一个对象转到另一个对象；但不会像结合是不间断的，而且我们曾经遇到的所有例子都是统一的，是一个整体的时候，有如此完整的习惯。在我们的行动和推理中，我们从常见的经验中得知，在任何生活过程中的持续坚持都会产生一种强烈的倾向和趋势，以便在未来继续下去；尽管有些习惯的力量程度较低，与我们行为中的稳定和统一程度较低相称。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is no doubt but this principle sometimes takes place, and produces those inferences we draw from contrary phænomena; tho' I am persuaded, that upon examination we shall not find it to be the principle, that most commonly influences the mind in this species of reasoning. When we follow only the habitual determination of the mind, we make the transition without any reflection, and interpose not a moments delay betwixt the view of one object and the belief of that, which is often found to attend it. As the custom depends not upon any deliberation, it operates immediately, without allowing any time for reflection. But this method of proceeding we have but few instances of in our probable reasonings; and even fewer than in those, which are deriv'd from the uninterrupted conjunction of objects. In the former species of reasoning we commonly take knowingly into consideration the contrariety of past events; we compare the different sides of the contrariety, and carefully weigh the experiments, which we have on each side: Whence we may conclude, that our reasonings of this kind arise not <i class="calibre10">directly</i> from the habit, but in an <i class="calibre10">oblique</i> manner; which we must now endeavour to explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">毫无疑问，这一原则有时会发生，并产生我们从相反的现象中得出的那些推论；尽管我相信，经过检查，我们不会发现它是在这种推理中最常影响心灵的原则。当我们只遵循头脑中的习惯性决定时，我们会在没有任何思考的情况下进行转换，并且在看到一个物体和相信那个物体之间没有片刻的延迟，而这是经常发现的。由于这种习惯不取决于任何考虑，它立即发挥作用，不允许有任何思考的时间。但是，在我们可能的推理中，这种进行方式的例子很少；甚至比那些从对象的不间断结合中得出的推理还要少。在前一种推理中，我们通常明知故犯地考虑到过去事件的反差；我们比较反差的不同方面，并仔细权衡我们在每一方面的实验。因此，我们可以得出结论，我们的这种推理不是<i class="calibre10">直接</i>从习惯中产生的，而是以一种间接<i class="calibre10">的</i>方式产生的；我们现在必须努力解释这一点。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis evident, that when an object is attended with contrary effects, we judge of them only by our past experience, and always consider those as possible, which we have observ'd to follow from it. And as past experience regulates our judgment concerning the possibility of these effects, so it does that concerning their probability; and that effect, which has been the most common, we always esteem the most likely. Here then are two things to be consider'd, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">reasons</i> which determine us to make the past a standard for the future, and the manner how we extract a single judgment from a contrariety of past events.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First we may observe, that the supposition, <i class="calibre10">that the future resembles the past</i>, is not founded on arguments of any kind, but is deriv'd entirely from habit, by which we are determin'd to expect for the future the same train of objects, to which we have been accustom'd. This habit or determination to transfer the past to the future is full and perfect; and consequently the first impulse of the imagination in this species of reasoning is endow'd with the same qualities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们可以看到，<i class="calibre10">未来与过去相似</i>的假设不是建立在任何种类的论据上，而是完全来自于习惯，根据这种习惯，我们决定对未来期待与我们已经习惯的对象相同。这种将过去转移到未来的习惯或决心是充分和完美的；因此，在这种推理中，想象力的第一冲动也被赋予了同样的品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But, <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, when in considering past experiments we find them of a contrary nature, this determination, tho' full and perfect in itself, presents us with no steady object, but offers us a number of disagreeing images in a certain order and proportion. The first impulse, therefore, is here broke into pieces, and diffuses itself over all those images, of which each partakes an equal share of that force and vivacity, that is deriv'd from the impulse. Any of these past events may again happen; and we judge, that when they do happen, they will be mix'd in the same proportion as in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，当我们在考虑过去的实验时，发现它们具有相反的性质，这种决定，虽然本身是充分和完美的，但向我们展示的不是稳定的目标，而是按照一定的顺序和比例向我们提供一些不一致的图像。因此，第一个冲动在这里被分解成了碎片，并扩散到所有的图像上，其中每个图像都有同等的力量和活力，这是从冲动中衍生出来的。这些过去的事件中的任何一个都可能再次发生；而且我们判断，当它们真的发生时，它们将以与过去相同的比例混合。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If our intention, therefore, be to consider the proportions of contrary events in a great number of instances, the images presented by our past experience must remain in their <i class="calibre10">first form</i>, and preserve their first proportions. Suppose, for instance, I have found by long observation, that of twenty ships, which go to sea, only nineteen return. Suppose I see at present twenty ships that leave the port: I transfer my past experience to the future, and represent to myself nineteen of these ships as returning in safety, and one as perishing. Concerning this there can be no difficulty. But as we frequently run over those several ideas of past events, in order to form a judgment concerning one single event, which appears uncertain; this consideration must change the <i class="calibre10">first form</i> of our ideas, and draw together the divided images presented by experience; since 'tis to <i class="calibre10">it</i> we refer the determination of that particular event, upon which we reason. Many of these images are suppos'd to concur, and a superior number to concur on one side. These agreeing images unite together, and render the idea more strong and lively, not only than a mere fiction of the imagination, but also than any idea, which is supported by a lesser number of experiments. Each new experiment is as a new stroke of the pencil, which bestows an additional vivacity on the colours, without either multiplying or enlarging the figure. This operation of the mind has been so fully explain'd in treating of the probability of chance, that I need not here endeavour to render it more intelligible. Every past experiment may be consider'd as a kind of chance; it being uncertain to us, whether the object will exist comformable to one experiment or another: And for this reason every thing that has been said on the one subject is applicable to both. Thus upon the whole, contrary experiments produce an imperfect belief, either by weakening the habit, or by dividing and afterwards joining in different parts, that <i class="calibre10">perfect</i> habit, which makes us conclude in general, that instances, of which we have no experience, must necessarily resemble those of which we have.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，如果我们的目的是考虑大量事例中相反事件的比例，我们过去的经验所呈现的图像必须保持其<i class="calibre10">最初的形式</i>，并保持其最初的比例。例如，假设我通过长期观察发现，在二十艘出海的船只中，只有十九艘返回。假设我现在看到有二十艘船离开港口。我把我过去的经验转移到未来，并对自己说，这些船中有 19 艘是安全返回的，有一艘是灭亡的。关于这一点，不会有什么困难。但是，由于我们经常翻阅过去事件的几种想法，以便对一个看起来不确定的单一事件作出判断；这种考虑必须改变我们想法的<i class="calibre10">第一种形式</i>，并将经验所呈现的分裂的图像汇集在一起；因为我们是根据<i class="calibre10">它</i>来确定那个特定事件的，我们据此进行推理。这些图像中的许多都被认为是一致的，而更多的是一致的一面。这些一致的形象结合在一起，使这个想法更加强烈和生动，不仅比单纯的想象力的虚构，而且比任何由较少数量的实验支持的想法。每一个新的实验就像铅笔的一个新的笔触，它给颜色带来了额外的活力，而没有增加或扩大图形。心灵的这种运作在论述偶然性的概率时已经有了充分的解释，我不需要在这里努力使它更容易理解。过去的每一个实验都可以被看作是一种机会；对我们来说，不确定物体的存在是否符合一个实验的要求。由于这个原因，在一个主题上所说的每一件事都适用于两个主题。因此，总的来说，相反的实验会产生一种不完美的信念，或者是通过削弱习惯，或者是通过分割，然后在不同的部分结合起来，这种<i class="calibre10">完美的</i>习惯使我们一般地得出结论，即我们没有经验的例子，必然与我们有经验的例子相似。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">

		<p class="block_6 en">To justify still farther this account of the second species of probability, where we reason with knowledge and reflection from a contrariety of past experiments, I shall propose the following considerations, without fearing to give offence by that air of subtilty, which attends them. Just reasoning ought still, perhaps, to retain its force, however subtile; in the same manner as matter preserves its solidity in the air, and fire, and animal spirits, as well as in the grosser and more sensible forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了进一步证明第二种可能性的说法，即我们从过去的实验对比中用知识和思考进行推理，我将提出以下考虑，而不必担心因这些考虑所带来的狡猾的空气而引起冒犯。公正的推理也许仍应保持其力量，无论多么微妙；就像物质在空气、火和动物精神中以及在更粗大和更感性的形式中保持其稳固性一样。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, We may observe, that there is no probability so great as not to allow of a contrary possibility; because otherwise 'twou'd cease to be a probability, and wou'd become a certainty. That probability of causes, which is most extensive, and which we at present examine, depends on a contrariety of experiments; and 'tis evident an experiment in the past proves at least a possibility for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们可以看到，没有任何概率大到不允许有相反的可能性；因为否则的话，这就不再是一种概率，而会成为一种确定性。我们目前所研究的最广泛的原因的概率，取决于各种实验的对比；显然，过去的实验至少证明了未来的可能性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, The component parts of this possibility and probability are of the same nature, and differ in number only, but not in kind. It has been observ'd, that all single chances are entirely equal, and that the only circumstance, which can give any event, that is contingent, a superiority over another, is a superior number of chances. In like manner, as the uncertainty of causes is discover'd by experience, which presents us with a view of contrary events, 'tis plain, that when we transfer the past to the future, the known to the unknown, every past experiment has the same weight, and that 'tis only a superior number of them, which can throw the ballance on any side. The possibility, therefore, which enters into every reasoning of this kind, is compos'd of parts, which are of the same nature both among themselves, and with those, that compose the opposite probability.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，这种可能性和概率的组成部分具有相同的性质，只在数量上有区别，但在种类上没有区别。据观察，所有单一的机会都是完全平等的，唯一能使任何事件（即偶然事件）优于另一事件的情况，是机会的数量更多。同样，由于原因的不确定性是由经验发现的，它向我们展示了相反的事件，因此很明显，当我们把过去转移到未来，把已知转移到未知时，每一个过去的实验都有相同的分量，只有它们的数量多，才能把天平放在任何一边。因此，进入这种推理的可能性是由各部分组成的，这些部分在它们之间以及与构成相反的可能性的部分具有相同的性质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, We may establish it as a certain maxim, that in all moral as well as natural phænomena, wherever any cause consists of a number of parts, and the effect encreases or diminishes, according to the variation of that number, the effect, properly speaking, is a compounded one, and arises from the union of the several effects, that proceed from each part of the cause. Thus because the gravity of a body encreases or diminishes by the encrease or diminution of its parts, we conclude that each part contains this quality and contributes to the gravity of the whole. The absence or presence of a part of the cause is attended with that of a proportionable part of the effect. This connexion or constant conjunction sufficiently proves the one part to be the cause of the other. As the belief, which we have of any event, encreases or diminishes according to the number of chances or past experiments, 'tis to be consider'd as a compounded effect, of which each part arises from a proportionable number of chances or experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，我们可以把它确定为一条格言，即在所有道德和自然现象中，凡是任何原因由若干部分组成，而结果根据该数字的变化而增加或减少，正确地说，该结果是一个复合的结果，是由原因的每一部分产生的若干效果的结合。因此，由于一个物体的重力因其各部分的增加或减少而增加或减少，我们得出结论，每个部分都包含这种质量，并对整个物体的重力有所贡献。原因的一个部分的缺失或存在与结果的一个相应部分的缺失或存在相伴随。这种联系或持续的结合足以证明这一部分是另一部分的原因。由于我们对任何事件的信念是根据机会或过去的实验的数量而增加或减少的，因此应将其视为一种复合效应，其中的每一部分都是由相应数量的机会或实验产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Let us now join these three observations, and see what conclusion we can draw from them. To every probability there is an opposite possibility. This possibility is compos'd of parts, that are entirely of the same nature with those of the probability; and consequently have the same influence on the mind and understanding. The belief, which attends the probability, is a compounded effect, and is form'd by the concurrence of the several effects, which proceed from each part of the probability. Since therefore each part of the probability contributes to the production of the belief, each part of the possibility must have the same influence on the opposite side; the nature of these parts being entirely the same. The contrary belief, attending the possibility, implies a view of a certain object, as well as the probability does an opposite view. In this particular both these degrees of belief are alike. The only manner then, in which the superior number of similar component parts in the one can exert its influence, and prevail above the inferior in the other, is by producing a stronger and more lively view of its object. Each part presents a particular view; and all these views uniting together produce one general view, which is fuller and more distinct by the greater number of causes or principles, from which it is deriv'd.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在让我们把这三个观察结合起来，看看我们能从中得出什么结论。每个可能性都有一个相反的可能性。这种可能性是由一些部分组成的，这些部分的性质与可能性的性质完全相同；因此对头脑和理解力有同样的影响。伴随着概率而来的信念是一种复合效应，是由概率的每一部分所产生的几种效应共同构成的。因此，既然可能性的每一部分都有助于信念的产生，那么可能性的每一部分都必须对反面产生同样的影响；这些部分的性质是完全一样的。与之相反的信念，在可能性的作用下，意味着对某一对象的看法，就像概率对一个相反的看法一样。在这一点上，这两种程度的信念是相同的。那么，在一个人中，类似的组成部分的优势数量能够发挥其影响，并在另一个人中战胜劣势的唯一方式，就是对其对象产生更强烈和更生动的看法。每个部分都提出了一个特殊的观点；而所有这些观点结合在一起，产生了一个总的观点，由于它是由更多的原因或原则衍生出来的，所以它更充分和更鲜明。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The component parts of the probability and possibility, being alike in their nature, must produce like effects; and the likeness of their effects consists in this, that each of them presents a view of a particular object. But tho' these parts be alike in their nature, they are very different in their quantity and number; and this difference must appear in the effect as well as the similarity. Now as the view they present is in both cases full and entire, and comprehends the object in all its parts, 'tis impossible that in this particular there can be any difference; nor is there any thing but a superior vivacity in the probability, arising from the concurrence of a superior number of views, which can distinguish these effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">概率和可能性的组成部分在性质上是相同的，因此必须产生相似的效果；它们的效果的相似性在于，它们中的每一个都呈现出对一个特定对象的看法。但是，尽管这些部分在性质上是相同的，它们在数量上却有很大的不同；这种不同必须出现在效果上，也出现在相似性上。现在，由于它们所呈现的景象在两种情况下都是完整的，并且包含了物体的所有部分，所以在这一点上不可能有任何区别；也不可能有任何东西，而只是在概率上有更大的活力，这是因为有更多的景象同时存在，才能区分出这些效果。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here is almost the same argument in a different light. All our reasonings concerning the probability of causes are founded on the transferring of past to future. The transferring of any past experiment to the future is sufficient to give us a view of the object; whether that experiment be single, or combin'd with others of the same kind; whether it be entire, or oppos'd by others of a contrary kind. Suppose, then, it acquires both these qualities of combination and opposition, it loses not upon that account its former power of presenting a view of the object, but only concurs with and opposes other experiments, that have a like influence. A question, therefore, may arise concerning the manner both of the concurrence and opposition. As to the <i class="calibre10">concurrence</i>, there is only the choice left betwixt these two hypotheses. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, That the view of the object, occasion'd by the transference of each past experiment, preserves itself entire, and only multiplies the number of views. Or, <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, That it runs into the other similar and correspondent views, and gives them a superior degree of force and vivacity. But that the first hypothesis is erroneous, is evident from experience, which informs us, that the belief, attending any reasoning, consists in one conclusion, not in a multitude of similar ones, which wou'd only distract the mind, and in many cases wou'd be too numerous to be comprehended distinctly by any finite capacity. It remains, therefore, as the only reasonable opinion, that these similar views run into each other, and unite their forces; so as to produce a stronger and clearer view, than what arises from any one alone. This is the manner, in which past experiments concur, when they are transfer'd to any future event. As to the manner of their <i class="calibre10">opposition</i>, 'tis evident, that as the contrary views are incompatible with each other, and 'tis impossible the object can at once exist conformable to both of them, their influence becomes mutually destructive, and the mind is determin'd to the superior only with that force, which remains after subtracting the inferior.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这里几乎是同一论点的另一种体现。我们所有关于原因概率的推理都是建立在把过去转移到未来的基础上的。将任何过去的实验转移到未来，就足以让我们对对象有一个看法；不管这个实验是单一的，还是与其他同类实验相结合的；不管它是完整的，还是与其他同类实验相反的。那么，假设它获得了这些组合和反对的品质，它并不因此而失去它以前对物体的看法的能力，而只是与具有类似影响的其他实验相配合和反对。因此，可能会出现一个关于结合和反对的方式的问题。关于<i class="calibre10">一致</i>，只剩下在这两种假设之间的选择。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，对物体的看法，由过去每个实验的转移所引起的，保留了自己的全部，而只是增加了看法的数量。或者，<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，它与其他类似的和相应的观点相联系，并使它们具有更高的力量和活力。但第一种假设是错误的，这一点从经验中可以看出，任何推理所产生的信念都是由一个结论组成的，而不是由许多类似的结论组成的，这些结论只会分散人们的注意力，而且在许多情况下，由于数量太多，任何有限的能力都无法清楚地理解。因此，唯一合理的观点是，这些类似的观点相互碰撞，并将它们的力量结合起来；从而产生一个比任何一个单独产生的观点更强大、更清晰的观点。这就是过去的实验在转移到任何未来的事件中时所采用的方式。至于它们的<i class="calibre10">对立</i>方式，很明显，由于相反的观点是互不相容的，而且对象不可能同时符合它们两个的要求，它们的影响就变成了相互破坏，而头脑中只有在减去劣势后剩下的力量才会被确定为优势。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I am sensible how abstruse all this reasoning must appear to the generality of readers, who not being accustom'd to such profound reflections on the intellectual faculties of the mind, will be apt to reject as chimerical whatever strikes not in with the common receiv'd notions, and with the easiest and most obvious principles of philosophy. And no doubt there are some pains requir'd to enter into these arguments; tho' perhaps very little are necessary to perceive the imperfection of every vulgar hypothesis on this subject, and the little light, which philosophy can yet afford us in such sublime and such curious speculations. Let men be once fully perswaded of these two principles, <i class="calibre10">That there is nothing in any object, consider'd in itself, which can afford us a reason for drawing a conclusion beyond it;</i> and, <i class="calibre10">That even after the observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have had experience;</i> I say, let men be once fully convinc'd of these two principles, and this will throw them so loose from all common systems, that they will make no difficulty of receiving any, which may appear the most extraordinary. These principles we have found to be sufficiently convincing, even with regard to our most certain reasonings from causation: But I shall venture to affirm, that with regard to these conjectural or probable reasonings they still acquire a new degree of evidence.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我意识到，对于广大读者来说，所有这些推理必须显得多么深奥，他们不习惯于对心灵的智力进行如此深刻的反思，很容易把不符合普遍接受的概念和最简单、最明显的哲学原则的东西当作是虚构的。毫无疑问，进入这些争论需要一些痛苦；但也许只需要很少的痛苦就能看出这个问题上每一个庸俗假设的不完善，以及哲学在这种崇高和这种奇怪的猜测中所能提供给我们的一点光亮。让人们充分认识到这两个原则，<i class="calibre10">即任何物体本身没有任何东西可以让我们得出超越它的结论；</i>以及<i class="calibre10">即使在观察了物体的频繁或持续结合之后，我们也没有理由就任何物体得出超越我们经验的推论；</i>我说，让人们充分认识到这两个原则，这将使他们从所有普通系统中摆脱出来，以至于他们将不难接受任何可能看起来最不寻常的东西。我们发现这些原则有足够的说服力，甚至对我们最确定的因果关系的推理也是如此。但我要大胆地说，对于这些猜想的或可能的推理，它们仍然获得了新的证据程度。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, 'Tis obvious, that in reasonings of this kind, 'tis not the object presented to us, which, consider'd in itself, affords us any reason to draw a conclusion concerning any other object or event. For as this latter object is suppos'd uncertain, and as the uncertainty is deriv'd from a conceal'd contrariety of causes in the former, were any of the causes plac'd in the known qualities of that object, they wou'd no longer be conceal'd, nor wou'd our conclusion be uncertain.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，很明显，在这种推理中，向我们提出的对象本身并不能为我们提供任何理由来得出有关任何其他对象或事件的结论。因为后一个对象被认为是不确定的，而这种不确定是由前一个对象中隐藏的各种原因引起的，如果任何一个原因被置于该对象的已知品质中，它们就不会再被隐藏，我们的结论也不会不确定。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But, <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, 'tis equally obvious in this species of reasoning, that if the transference of the past to the future were founded merely on a conclusion of the understanding, it cou'd never occasion any belief or assurance. When we transfer contrary experiments to the future, we can only repeat these contrary experiments with their particular proportions; which cou'd not produce assurance in any single event, upon which we reason, unless the fancy melted together all those images that concur, and extracted from them one single idea or image, which is intense and lively in proportion to the number of experiments from which it is deriv'd, and their superiority above their antagonists. Our past experience presents no determinate object; and as our belief, however faint, fixes itself on a determinate object, 'tis evident that the belief arises not merely from the transference of past to future, but from some operation of the <i class="calibre10">fancy</i> conjoin'd with it. This may lead us to conceive the manner, in which that faculty enters into all our reasonings.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，在这种推理中，同样明显的是，如果把过去转移到未来仅仅建立在理解力的结论上，它永远不会产生任何信念或保证。当我们把相反的实验转移到未来时，我们只能以它们的特定比例重复这些相反的实验；这不可能在我们推理的任何单一事件中产生保证，除非幻想把所有这些同时出现的图像融为一体，并从它们中提取出一个单一的想法或图像，这种想法或图像的强烈和生动程度与它所衍生的实验的数量以及它们高于其对手的优势成比例。我们过去的经验没有呈现出确定的对象；而我们的信念，无论多么微弱，都将自己固定在一个确定的对象上，显然，这种信念的产生不仅仅是来自过去对未来的转移，而是来自与之相联系的某种<i class="calibre10">幻想</i>的运作。这可以使我们想象出这种能力进入我们所有推理的方式。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall conclude this subject with two reflections, which may deserve our attention. The <i class="calibre10">first</i> may be explain'd after this manner. When the mind forms a reasoning concerning any matter of fact, which is only probable, it casts its eye backward upon past experience, and transferring it to the future, is presented with so many contrary views of its object, of which those that are of the same kind uniting together, and running into one act of the mind, serve to fortify and inliven it. But suppose that this multitude of views or glimpses of an object proceeds not from experience, but from a voluntary act of the imagination; this effect does not follow, or at least, follows not in the same degree. For tho' custom and education produce belief by such a repetition, as is not deriv'd from experience, yet this requires a long tract of time, along with a very frequent and <i class="calibre10">undersign'd</i> repetition. In general we may pronounce, that a person, who wou'd <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-131" id="calibre_link-221" title="20">20</a></sup><i class="calibre10">voluntarily</i> repeat any idea in his mind, tho' supported by one past experience, wou'd be no more inclin'd to believe the existence of its object, than if he had contented himself with one survey of it. Beside the effect of design; each act of the mind, being separate and independent, has a separate influence, and joins not its force with that of its fellows. Not being united by any common object, producing them, they have no relation to each other; and consequently make no transition or union of forces. This phænomenon we shall understand better afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将以两个值得我们注意的思考来结束这个话题。<i class="calibre10">第一个</i>问题可以这样解释。当人们对任何事实形成推理时，这只是一种可能性，它将目光投向过去的经验，并将其转移到未来，呈现出许多关于其目标的相反观点，其中那些同类的观点结合在一起，并流入心灵的一个行为，有助于加强和活跃它。但是，假设对一个物体的多种看法或瞥见不是来自于经验，而是来自于想象力的自愿行为；这种效果就不会出现，或者至少不会在同样的程度上出现。因为尽管习惯和教育通过这样的重复来产生信仰，而不是来自于经验，但这需要很长的时间，以及非常频繁和<i class="calibre10">低调的</i>重复。一般来说，我们可以说，一个人，如果他愿意 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-131" id="calibre_link-221" title="20">20</a></sup>一个人如果<i class="calibre10">自愿</i>重复他心中的任何想法，尽管有过去的经验支持，也不会比他满足于对它的一次调查而更倾向于相信其对象的存在。除了设计的效果之外，心灵的每一个行为都是独立的，有单独的影响，并不与其他行为的力量结合。由于没有任何共同的对象来产生它们，它们彼此之间没有任何关系；因此，没有任何力量的过渡或结合。这个现象我们以后会更好地理解。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">My second reflection is founded on those large probabilities, which the mind can judge of, and the minute differences it can observe betwixt them. When the chances or experiments on one side amount to ten thousand, and on the other to ten thousand and one, the judgment gives the preference to the latter, upon account of that superiority; tho' 'tis plainly impossible for the mind to run over every particular view, and distinguish the superior vivacity of the image arising from the superior number, where the difference is so inconsiderable. We have a parallel instance in the affections. 'Tis evident, according to the principles above mention'd, that when an object produces any passion in us, which varies according to the different quantity of the object; I say, 'tis evident, that the passion, properly speaking, is not a simple emotion, but a compounded one, of a great number of weaker passions, deriv'd from a view of each part of the object. For otherwise 'twere impossible the passion shou'd encrease by the encrease of these parts. Thus a man, who desires a thousand pound, has in reality a thousand or more desires, which uniting together, seem to make only one passion; tho' the composition evidently betrays itself upon every alteration of the object, by the preference he gives to the larger number, if superior only by an unite. Yet nothing can be more certain, than that so small a difference wou'd not be discernible in the passions, nor cou'd render them distinguishable from each other. The difference, therefore, of our conduct in preferring the greater number depends not upon our passions, but upon custom, and <i class="calibre10">general rules</i>. We have found in a multitude of instances, that the augmenting the numbers of any sum augments the passion, where the numbers are precise and the difference sensible. The mind can perceive from its immediate feeling, that three guineas produce a greater passion than two; and <i class="calibre10">this</i> it transfers to larger numbers, because of the resemblance; and by a general rule assigns to a thousand guineas, a stronger passion than to nine hundred and ninety nine. These general rules we shall explain presently.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我的第二个思考是建立在那些大的概率上的，心灵可以判断的，以及它可以观察到的它们之间的微小差异。当一方的机会或实验达到一万个，另一方的机会或实验达到一万零一个时，由于后者的优越性，判断力就会优先考虑后者；尽管 “头脑显然不可能跑遍每一个特定的观点，并区分出由优越的数量所产生的图像的优越活力，而这种差异是如此微不足道。我们在情感方面有一个类似的例子。根据上面提到的原则，很明显，当一个物体在我们身上产生任何激情时，这种激情会根据物体的不同数量而变化；我说，很明显，这种激情，正确地说，不是一种简单的情感，而是一种复合的情感，由大量较弱的激情组成，从物体的每个部分衍生而来。因为否则的话，激情不可能随着这些部分的增加而增加。因此，一个渴望得到一千英镑的人，实际上有一千或更多的欲望，这些欲望结合在一起，似乎只构成一种激情；尽管这种成分在对象的每一次改变中都明显地暴露出来，因为他对较大的数量给予了优先考虑，如果只是通过结合来提高的话。然而，没有什么能比这更肯定的了，这么小的差别在激情中是看不出来的，也不可能使它们彼此区分开来。因此，我们在选择人数较多的人方面的行为差异，不是取决于我们的激情，而是取决于习俗和<i class="calibre10">一般规则</i>。我们在许多例子中发现，在数字精确和差异明显的情况下，增加任何总数的数字都会增加激情。心灵可以从它的直接感觉中察觉到，三基尼比两基尼产生更大的激情；由于相似性，它将<i class="calibre10">这种</i>激情转移到更大的数字上；根据一般规则，对一千基尼的激情比对九百九十九的激情更强烈。我们将在下文中解释这些一般规则。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But beside these two species of probability, which are deriv'd from an <i class="calibre10">imperfect</i> experience and from <i class="calibre10">contrary</i> causes, there is a third arising from Analogy, which differs from them in some material circumstances. According to the hypothesis above explain'd all kinds of reasoning from causes or effects are founded on two particulars, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the constant conjunction of any two objects in all past experience, and the resemblance of a present object to any one of them. The effect of these two particulars is, that the present object invigorates and inlivens the imagination; and the resemblance, along with the constant union, conveys this force and vivacity to the related idea; which we are therefore said to believe, or assent to. If you weaken either the union or resemblance, you weaken the principle of transition, and of consequence that belief, which arises from it. The vivacity of the first impression cannot be fully convey'd to the related idea, either where the conjunction of their objects is not constant, or where the present impression does not perfectly resemble any of those, whose union we are accustom'd to observe. In those probabilities of chance and causes above explain'd, 'tis the constancy of the union, which is diminish'd; and in the probability deriv'd from analogy, 'tis the resemblance only, which is affected. Without some degree of resemblance, as well as union, 'tis impossible there can be any reasoning: but as this resemblance admits of many different degrees, the reasoning becomes proportionally more or less firm and certain. An experiment loses of its force, when transfer'd to instances, which are not exactly resembling; tho' 'tis evident it may still retain as much as may be the foundation of probability, as long as there is any resemblance remaining.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，除了这两种<i class="calibre10">从不完美的</i>经验和<i class="calibre10">相反的</i>原因中得出的可能性之外，还有第三种从类比中产生的可能性，它在某些物质条件下与它们不同。根据上面解释的假设，所有从原因或效果出发的推理都建立在两个细节上，<i class="calibre10">即</i>在所有过去的经验中任何两个对象的持续结合，以及现在的对象与其中任何一个的相似性。这两个特点的作用是，现在的物体使想象力活跃起来；而相似性，加上持续的结合，将这种力量和活力传递给相关的想法；因此，我们被说成是相信，或同意。如果你削弱了结合或相似性，你就削弱了过渡原则，以及由此产生的信念。第一印象的活力不能完全传达给相关的想法，要么是在它们的对象的结合不是恒定的情况下，要么是在目前的印象与我们习惯于观察的那些结合不完全相似的情况下。在上面解释的那些机会和原因的概率中，减少的是结合的恒定性；而在从类比中得出的概率中，影响的只是相似性。如果没有某种程度的相似和结合，就不可能有任何推理：但由于这种相似可以有许多不同的程度，推理就会相应地变得更加坚定和确定。当一个实验被转移到不完全相似的实例上时，它就失去了力量；但很明显，只要还有任何相似之处，它仍然可以尽可能多地保留可能性的基础。</p></div>

But there are others, that are deriv'd from the same principles, tho' they have not had the good fortune to obtain the same sanction. The <i class="calibre10">first</i> probability of this kind may be accounted for thus. The diminution of the union, and of the resemblance, as above explained, diminishes the facility of the transition, and by that means weakens the evidence; and we may farther observe, that the same diminution of the evidence will follow from a diminution of the impression, and from the shading of those colours, under which it appears to the memory or senses. The argument, which we found on any matter of fact we remember, is more or less convincing, according as the fact is recent or remote; and tho' the difference in these degrees of evidence be not receiv'd by philosophy as solid and legitimate; because in that case an argument must have a different force to day, from what it shall have a month hence; yet notwithstanding the opposition of philosophy, 'tis certain, this circumstance has a considerable influence on the understanding, and secretly changes the authority of the same argument, according to the different times, in which it is propos'd to us.

		<p class="block_6 en">There is a <i class="calibre10">second</i> difference, which we may frequently observe in our degrees of belief and assurance, and which never fails to take place, tho' disclaimed by philosophers. An experiment, that is recent and fresh in the memory, affects us more than one that is in some measure obliterated; and has a superior influence on the judgment, as well as on the passions. A lively impression produces more assurance than a faint one; because it has more original force to communicate to the related idea, which thereby acquires a greater force and vivacity. A recent observation has a like effect; because the custom and transition is there more entire, and preserves better the original force in the communication. Thus a drunkard, who has seen his companion die of a debauch, is struck with that instance for some time, and dreads a like accident for himself: But as the memory of it decays away by degrees, his former security returns, and the danger seems less certain and real. I add, as a third instance of this kind, that tho' our reasonings from proofs and from probabilities be considerably different from each other, yet the former species of reasoning often degenerates insensibly into the latter, by nothing but the multitude of connected arguments. 'Tis certain, that when an inference is drawn immediately from an object, without any intermediate cause or effect, the conviction is much stronger, and the persuasion more lively, than when the imagination is carry'd thro' a long chain of connected arguments, however infallible the connexion of each link may be esteem'd. 'Tis from the original impression, that the vivacity of all the ideas is deriv'd, by means of the customary transition of the imagination; and 'tis evident this vivacity must gradually decay in proportion to the distance, and must lose somewhat in each transition. Sometimes this distance has a greater influence than even contrary experiments wou'd have; and a man may receive a more lively conviction from a probable reasoning, which is close and immediate, than from a long chain of consequences, tho' just and conclusive in each part. Nay 'tis seldom such reasonings produce any conviction; and one must have a very strong and firm imagination to preserve the evidence to the end, where it passes thro' so many stages.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">还有</i>一个区别，我们可以在我们的信仰和保证的程度中经常观察到，虽然哲学家们不承认，但这种区别从未发生过。一个最近的、记忆犹新的实验比一个在某种程度上被遗忘的实验对我们的影响更大；而且对判断力和激情的影响也更大。一个生动的印象比一个微弱的印象产生更多的保证；因为它有更多的原始力量传达给相关的想法，从而获得更大的力量和活力。最近的观察也有类似的效果；因为那里的习惯和过渡更完整，而且在交流中更好地保留了原始力量。因此，一个酒鬼，如果看到他的同伴死于酗酒，就会在一段时间内对这个例子感到震惊，并害怕自己发生类似的事故。但随着记忆的逐渐消失，他又恢复了以前的安全感，危险也就显得不那么确定和真实了。我补充说，作为这种情况的第三个例子，尽管我们从证据和概率中进行的推理有很大的不同，但前一种推理往往会不经意地退化成后一种推理，原因无非是众多的关联论据。可以肯定的是，当一个推论是立即从一个对象中得出的，没有任何中间的原因或效果，其说服力要比想象力通过一长串相连的论据时强得多，无论每个环节的联系如何被认为是无懈可击的。所有思想的活力都来自于原始印象，通过想象力的习惯性转换；很明显，这种活力会随着距离的增加而逐渐减弱，并且在每次转换中都会有所损失。有时这种距离的影响甚至比相反的实验还要大；一个人可能从一个近在咫尺的可能推理中得到更生动的信念，而不是从一长串的后果中得到，尽管每一部分都是公正和确凿的。不，这种推理很少能产生任何信念；人们必须有非常强大和坚定的想象力，才能将证据保存到最后，因为它经历了这么多阶段。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But here it may not be amiss to remark a very curious phænomenon, which the present subject suggests to us. 'Tis evident there is no point of ancient history, of which we can have any assurance, but by passing thro' many millions of causes and effects, and thro' a chain of arguments of almost an immeasurable length. Before the knowledge of the fact cou'd come to the first historian, it must be convey'd thro' many mouths; and after it is committed to writing, each new copy is a new object, of which the connexion with the foregoing is known only by experience and observation. Perhaps, therefore, it may be concluded from the precedent reasoning, that the evidence of all ancient history must now be lost; or at least, will be lost in time, as the chain of causes encreases, and runs on to a greater length. But as it seems contrary to common sense to think, that if the republic of letters, and the art of printing continue on the same footing as at present, our posterity, even after a thousand ages, can ever doubt if there has been such a man as Julius Cæsar; this may be consider'd as an objection to the present system. If belief consisted only in a certain vivacity, convey'd from an original impression, it wou'd decay by the length of the transition, and must at last be utterly extinguish'd: And <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i>, if belief on some occasions be not capable of such an extinction; it must be something different from that vivacity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但在这里，我们不妨说说目前这个问题给我们带来的一个非常奇怪的现象。很明显，在古代历史中，没有任何一点是我们可以确信的，除非是通过数百万个因果关系，以及通过几乎不可估量的论证链。在第一个历史学家了解到这一事实之前，它必须通过许多人的嘴来传达；在它被写成文字之后，每一个新的副本都是一个新的对象，它与前述内容的联系只有通过经验和观察才能知道。因此，也许可以从前面的推理中得出结论，所有古代历史的证据现在必须消失；或者至少会随着时间的推移而消失，因为原因链在不断增加，而且长度也在不断增加。但是，如果字母共和国和印刷术继续保持目前的状态，我们的后人即使在一千多年后也会怀疑是否有朱利叶斯·凯撒这样的人，这种想法似乎有悖于常理；这可以被视为对目前制度的反对。如果信仰只包括从原始印象中传递出来的某种活力，它就会因过渡期的长短而衰败，最后必须彻底消亡。<i class="calibre10">反之亦然</i>，如果信仰在某些情况下不具备这种消亡的能力，它就必须是与这种活力不同的东西。</p></div>

And indeed it must be confest, that in this manner of considering the subject, (which however is not a true one) there is no history or tradition, but what must in the end lose all its force and evidence.

		<p class="block_6 en">Mean while to give a solution of the preceding objection upon the supposition, that historical evidence amounts at first to an entire proof; let us consider, that tho' the links are innumerable, that connect any original fact with the present impression, which is the foundation of belief; yet they are all of the same kind, and depend on the fidelity of Printers and Copists. One edition passes into another, and that into a third, and so on, till we come to that volume we peruse at present. There is no variation in the steps. After we know one, we know all of them; and after we have made one, we can have no scruple as to the rest. This circumstance alone preserves the evidence of history, and will perpetuate the memory of the present age to the latest posterity. If all the long chain of causes and effects, which connect any past event with any volume of history, were compos'd of parts different from each other, and which 'twere necessary for the mind distinctly to conceive, 'tis impossible we shou'd preserve to the end any belief or evidence. But as most of these proofs are perfectly resembling, the mind runs easily along them, jumps from one part to another with facility, and forms but a confus'd and general notion of each link. By this means a long chain of argument, has as little effect in diminishing the original vivacity, as a much shorter wou'd have, if compos'd of parts, which were different from each other, and of which each requir'd a distinct consideration.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在对前面的反对意见进行解答的同时，假设历史证据首先相当于一个完整的证据；让我们考虑一下，尽管连接任何原始事实和当前印象的环节数不胜数，这是信仰的基础；但它们都是同类的，并且取决于印刷商和复印商的忠诚度。一个版本进入另一个版本，另一个版本进入第三个版本，以此类推，直到我们现在看到的这一卷。这些步骤中没有任何变化。当我们知道一个版本后，我们就知道所有的版本；当我们做了一个版本后，我们就可以毫不顾忌地去做其他的。只有这种情况才能保留历史的证据，并将当代的记忆延续到最近的后世。如果将任何过去的事件与任何一卷历史联系起来的所有长长的因果链，都是由彼此不同的部分组成的，而这些部分是必须由头脑来明确设想的，那么我们就不可能将任何信仰或证据保留到最后。但是，由于这些证明中的大多数都是完全相似的，所以人们的思维很容易沿着它们运行，很容易从一个部分跳到另一个部分，并对每个环节形成一个混乱的和一般的概念。通过这种方式，一长串的论证在减少原来的活力方面所起的作用，就像短得多的论证一样，如果由不同的部分组成，而且每个部分都需要单独考虑的话。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Shou'd it be demanded why men form general rules, and allow them to influence their judgment, even contrary to present observation and experience, I shou'd reply, that in my opinion it proceeds from those very principles, on which all judgments concerning causes and effects depend. Our judgments concerning cause and effect are deriv'd from habit and experience; and when we have been accustom'd to see one object united to another, our imagination passes from the first to the second, by a natural transition, which precedes reflection, and which cannot be prevented by it. Now 'tis the nature of custom not only to operate with its full force, when objects are presented, that are exactly the same with those to which we have been accustom'd; but also to operate in an inferior degree, when we discover such as are similar; and tho' the habit loses somewhat of its force by every difference, yet 'tis seldom entirely destroy'd, where any considerable circumstances remain the same. A man, who has contracted a custom of eating fruit by the use of pears or peaches, will satisfy himself with melons, where he cannot find his favourite fruit; as one, who has become a drunkard by the use of red wines, will be carried almost with the same violence to white, if presented to him. From this principle I have accounted for that species of probability, deriv'd from analogy, where we transfer our experience in past instances to objects which are resembling, but are not exactly the same with those concerning which we have had experience. In proportion as the resemblance decays, the probability diminishes; but still has some force as long as there remain any traces of the resemblance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果有人问为什么人们会形成一般的规则，并允许它们影响他们的判断，甚至与目前的观察和经验相反，我会回答说，在我看来，这正是从这些原则出发的，所有关于原因和结果的判断都是基于此。我们对因果的判断来自于习惯和经验；当我们习惯于看到一个物体与另一个物体结合在一起时，我们的想象力就会从第一个物体转移到第二个物体，这是一种自然的过渡，它先于思考，而且不能被思考所阻止。现在，习惯的本质不仅是在出现与我们所习惯的对象完全相同的物体时发挥其全部力量；而且在我们发现类似的物体时，也会在较低的程度上发挥作用；尽管习惯会因每一次的不同而失去一些力量，但在任何相当大的情况保持不变时，很少会被完全摧毁。一个因吃梨或桃子而养成吃水果习惯的人，如果找不到他喜欢的水果，就会用瓜子来满足自己；就像一个因喝红葡萄酒而成为酒鬼的人，如果给他喝白葡萄酒，他几乎会以同样的速度喝下去。根据这一原则，我解释了从类比中得出的那种可能性，即我们把过去的经验转移到与我们有经验的对象相似，但不完全相同的对象上。随着相似性的减弱，概率也随之减弱；但只要还存在相似性的痕迹，就仍有一些力量。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This observation we may carry farther; and may remark, that tho' custom be the foundation of all our judgments, yet sometimes it has an effect on the imagination in opposition to the judgment, and produces a contrariety in our sentiments concerning the same object. I explain myself. In almost all kinds of causes there is a complication of circumstances, of which some are essential, and others superfluous; some are absolutely requisite to the production of the effect, and others are only conjoin'd by accident. Now we may observe, that when these superfluous circumstances are numerous, and remarkable, and frequently conjoin'd with the essential, they have such an influence on the imagination, that even in the absence of the latter they carry us on to the conception of the usual effect, and give to that conception a force and vivacity, which make it superior to the mere fictions of the fancy. We may correct this propensity by a reflection on the nature of those circumstances; but 'tis still certain, that custom takes the start, and gives a biass to the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以进一步观察；可以说，尽管习俗是我们所有判断的基础，但有时它对想象力的影响与判断相反，并在我们对同一对象的情感中产生矛盾。我自己解释一下。在几乎所有种类的原因中，都有一些复杂的情况，其中有些是必要的，有些是多余的；有些是产生结果的绝对必要条件，有些只是偶然结合起来的。现在我们可以看到，当这些多余的情况很多，而且很突出，并经常与必要的情况结合在一起时，它们对想象力有很大的影响，甚至在没有后者的情况下，它们也会把我们带到通常效果的概念中去，并给这种概念以力量和活力，使它比单纯的幻想的虚构要好。我们可以通过对这些情况的性质进行反思来纠正这种倾向；但仍然可以肯定的是，习俗是开始，并为想象力提供了一个偏向。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate this by a familiar instance, let us consider the case of a man, who being hung out from a high tower in a cage of iron cannot forbear trembling, when he surveys the precipice below him, tho' he knows himself to be perfectly secure from falling, by his experience of the solidity of the iron, which supports him; and tho' the ideas of fall and descent, and harm and death, be deriv'd solely from custom and experience. The same custom goes beyond the instances, from which it is deriv'd, and to which it perfectly corresponds; and influences his ideas of such objects as are in some respect resembling, but fall not precisely under the same rule. The circumstances of depth and descent strike so strongly upon him, that their influence cannot be destroy'd by the contrary circumstances of support and solidity, which ought to give him a perfect security. His imagination runs away with its object, and excites a passion proportion'd to it. That passion returns back upon the imagination and inlivens the idea; which lively idea has a new influence on the passion, and in its turn augments its force and violence; and both his fancy and affections, thus mutually supporting each other, cause the whole to have a very great influence upon him.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了用一个熟悉的例子来说明这一点，让我们考虑一个人的情况，他被吊在一个高塔的铁笼子里，当他看到下面的悬崖时，忍不住颤抖起来，尽管他知道自己是完全安全的，不会掉下去，因为他对支撑他的铁的坚固性有经验；尽管坠落和下降、伤害和死亡的观念完全来自习俗和经验。同样的习俗超越了它所衍生的、与之完全对应的实例；并且影响了他对那些在某些方面与之相似、但不完全属于同一规则的物体的想法。深度和下降的情况对他的影响如此强烈，以至于他们的影响不能被相反的支持和稳固的情况所破坏，而这些情况应该给他一个完美的安全感。他的想象力与它的目标背道而驰，并激发出与之相称的激情。这种激情又回到了想象力上，并使思想活跃起来；这种活跃的思想对激情产生了新的影响，反过来又增加了它的力量和暴力；他的幻想和情感，这样相互支持，使整个人对他产生了非常大的影响。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But why need we seek for other instances, while the present subject of [philosophical]<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-207" id="calibre_link-349" title="22">22</a></sup> probabilities offers us so obvious an one, in the opposition betwixt the judgment and imagination arising from these effects of custom? According to my system, all reasonings are nothing but the effects of custom; and custom has no influence, but by in livening the imagination, and giving us a strong conception of any object. It may, therefore, be concluded, that our judgment and imagination can never be contrary, and that custom cannot operate on the latter faculty after such a manner, as to render it opposite to the former. This difficulty we can remove after no other manner, than by supposing the influence of general rules. We shall afterwards take notice of some general rules, by which we ought to regulate our judgment concerning causes and effects; and these rules are form'd on the nature of our understanding, and on our experience of its operations in the judgments we form concerning objects. By them we learn to distinguish the accidental circumstances from the efficacious causes; and when we find that an effect can be produc'd without the concurrence of any particular circumstance, we conclude that that circumstance makes not a part of the efficacious cause, however frequently conjoin'd with it. But as this frequent conjunction necessarily makes it have some effect on the imagination, in spite of the opposite conclusion from general rules, the opposition of these two principles produces a contrariety in our thoughts, and causes us to ascribe the one inference to our judgment, and the other to our imagination. The general rule is attributed to our judgment; as being more extensive and constant. The exception to the imagination; as being more capricious and uncertain.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，我们为什么要寻找其他的例子，而目前的哲学主题为我们提供了如此明显的例子。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-207" id="calibre_link-349" title="22">22</a></sup>而现在的哲学概率主题为我们提供了一个如此明显的例子，即由习俗的这些影响所产生的判断力和想象力之间的对抗？根据我的体系，所有的推理都不过是习俗的影响；而习俗除了活跃想象力，让我们对任何物体有强烈的概念外，没有任何影响。因此，可以得出这样的结论：我们的判断力和想象力不可能是相反的，而且习俗不可能以这样的方式对后者的能力产生影响，使其与前者相反。除了假设一般规则的影响外，我们无法以其他方式来消除这一困难。我们随后会注意到一些一般规则，我们应该根据这些规则来规范我们对因果关系的判断；这些规则是根据我们理解力的性质，以及我们在对物体进行判断时的经验形成的。通过这些规则，我们学会了区分偶然的情况和有效的原因；当我们发现一个效果可以在没有任何特定情况下产生时，我们就会得出结论，该情况不属于有效的原因，不管它是如何频繁地与之结合的。但是，由于这种频繁的结合必然使它对想象力产生一些影响，尽管从一般规则得出的结论是相反的，这两个原则的对立在我们的思想中产生了矛盾，使我们把一个推论归于我们的判断，另一个归于我们的想象力。一般的规则被归于我们的判断力；因为它更广泛，更恒定。而想象力则是例外，因为它更加反复无常和不确定。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus our general rules are in a manner set in opposition to each other. When an object appears, that resembles any cause in very considerable circumstances, the imagination naturally carries us to a lively conception of the usual effect, tho' the object be different in the most material and most efficacious circumstances from that cause. Here is the first influence of general rules. But when we take a review of this act of the mind, and compare it with the more general and authentic operations of the understanding, we find it to be of an irregular nature, and destructive of all the most establish'd principles of reasonings; which is the cause of our rejecting it. This is a second influence of general rules, and implies the condemnation of the former. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other prevails, according to the disposition and character of the person. The vulgar are commonly guided by the first, and wise men by the second. Mean while the sceptics may here have the pleasure of observing a new and signal contradiction in our reason, and of seeing all philosophy ready to be subverted by a principle of human nature, and again sav'd by a new direction of the very same principle. The following of general rules is a very unphilosophical species of probability; and yet 'tis only by following them that we can correct this, and all other unphilosophical probabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们的一般规则在某种程度上是相互对立的。当一个物体出现，并且在非常大的情况下与任何原因相似时，想象力自然会使我们对通常的效果产生生动的概念，尽管该物体在最实质和最有效的情况下与该原因不同。这就是一般规则的第一个影响。但是，当我们审视心灵的这一行为，并将其与理解力的更一般和更真实的操作相比较时，我们发现它具有不规则的性质，并破坏了所有最成熟的推理原则；这就是我们拒绝它的原因。这是一般规则的第二个影响，意味着对前者的谴责。根据人的性情和性格，有时这一种，有时那一种占上风。庸人通常以第一种方式为指导，而智者则以第二种方式为指导。怀疑论者在这里可以很高兴地看到我们的理性中有一个新的、明显的矛盾，看到所有的哲学都准备被人性的一个原则所颠覆，又被同一个原则的一个新的方向所拯救。遵循一般规则是一种非常不符合哲学的概率；然而，只有通过遵循这些规则，我们才能纠正这种概率，以及所有其他不符合哲学的概率。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Since we have instances, where general rules operate on the imagination even contrary to the judgment, we need not be surpriz'd to see their effects encrease, when conjoin'd with that latter faculty, and to observe that they bestow on the ideas they present to us a force superior to what attends any other. Every one knows, there is an indirect manner of insinuating praise or blame, which is much less shocking than the open flattery or censure of any person. However he may communicate his sentiments by such secret insinuations, and make them known with equal certainty as by the open discovery of them, 'tis certain that their influence is not equally strong and powerful. One who lashes me with conceal'd strokes of satire, moves not my indignation to such a degree, as if he flatly told me I was a fool and coxcomb; tho' I equally understand his meaning, as if he did. This difference is to be attributed to the influence of general rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然我们有实例表明，一般规则对想象力的作用甚至与判断力相反，那么我们就不必惊奇地看到，当它们与后一种能力结合在一起时，它们的作用就会增强，并注意到它们给我们提出的想法赋予了一种比任何其他能力更强的力量。每个人都知道，有一种间接的方式来暗示赞美或指责，这比公开的奉承或指责任何人都要少得多。无论他如何通过这种秘密的影射来传达他的情感，并以同样的确定性使之与公开的发现相提并论，"可以肯定的是，其影响并不同样强烈和有力。一个人用隐蔽的讽刺笔触抽打我，不会像他直截了当地告诉我我是个傻瓜和笨蛋那样引起我的愤怒；尽管我同样明白他的意思，就像他明白一样。这种差异应归因于一般规则的影响。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Whether a person openly abuses me, or slyly intimates his contempt, in neither case do I immediately perceive his sentiment or opinion; and 'tis only by signs, that is, by its effects, I become sensible of it. The only difference, then, betwixt these two cases consists in this, that in the open discovery of his sentiments he makes use of signs, which are general and universal; and in the secret-intimation employs such as are more singular and uncommon. The effect of this circumstance is, that the imagination, in running from the present impression to the absent idea, makes the transition with greater facility, and consequently conceives the object with greater force, where the connexion is common and universal, than where it is more rare and particular. Accordingly we may observe, that the open declaration of our sentiments is call'd the taking off the mask, as the secret intimation of our opinions is said to be the veiling of them. The difference betwixt an idea produc'd by a general connexion, and that arising from a particular one is here compar'd to the difference betwixt an impression and an idea. This difference in the imagination has a suitable effect on the passions; and this effect is augmented by another circumstance. A secret intimation of anger or contempt shews that we still have some consideration for the person, and avoid the directly abusing him. This makes a conceal'd satire less disagreeable; but still this depends on the same principle. For if an idea were not more feeble, when only intimated, it wou'd never be esteem'd a mark of greater respect to proceed in this method than in the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">无论一个人是公开辱骂我，还是狡猾地暗示他的蔑视，在这两种情况下，我都不会立即察觉到他的情绪或观点；只有通过迹象，即通过其效果，我才会感觉到它。那么，这两种情况之间的唯一区别在于，在公开发现他的情绪时，他使用的是一般的和普遍的迹象；而在秘密暗示中，他使用的是更奇特和不常见的迹象。这种情况的影响是，想象力在从现在的印象到不存在的想法的过程中，会更方便地进行转换，因此，在联系是普通和普遍的情况下，比在更罕见和特殊的情况下，会更有力地构想出目标。因此，我们可以看到，公开宣布我们的情感被称为摘下面具，就像秘密暗示我们的观点被说成是对它们的遮掩。由一般联系产生的想法和由特定联系产生的想法之间的区别，在这里被比作印象和想法之间的区别。这种想象力上的差异对激情有适当的影响；而这种影响又因另一种情况而增加。愤怒或蔑视的秘密暗示表明，我们仍然对这个人有一些考虑，避免直接辱骂他。这使得隐蔽的讽刺不那么令人不快；但这仍然取决于同一原则。因为如果一个想法在暗示的时候不是更微弱的话，那么用这种方法比用另一种方法进行就不会被认为是更大的尊重。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Sometimes scurrility is less displeasing than delicate satire, because it revenges us in a manner for the injury at the very time it is committed, by affording us a just reason to blame and contemn the person, who injures us. But this phænomenon likewise depends upon the same principle. For why do we blame all gross and injurious language, unless it be, because we esteem it contrary to good breeding and humanity? And why is it contrary, unless it be more shocking than any delicate satire? The rules of good-breeding condemn whatever is openly disobliging, and gives a sensible pain and confusion to those, with whom we converse. After this is once establish'd, abusive language is universally blam'd, and gives less pain upon account of its coarseness and incivility, which render the person despicable, that employs it. It becomes less disagreeable, merely because originally it is more so; and 'tis more disagreeable, because it affords an inference by general and common rules, that are palpable and undeniable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To this explication of the different influence of open and conceal'd flattery or satire, I shall add the consideration of another phænomenon, which is analogous to it. There are many particulars in the point of honour both of men and women, whose violations, when open and avow'd, the world never excuses, but which it is more apt to overlook, when the appearances are sav'd, and the transgression is secret and conceal'd. Even those, who know with equal certainty, that the fault is committed, pardon it more easily, when the proofs seem in some measure oblique and equivocal, than when they are direct and undeniable. The same idea is presented in both cases, and, properly speaking, is equally assented to by the judgment; and yet its influence is different, because of the different manner, in which it is presented. Now if we compare these two cases, of the <i class="calibre10">open</i> and <i class="calibre10">conceal'd</i> violations of the laws of honour, we shall find, that the difference betwixt them consists in this, that in the first case the sign, from which we infer the blameable action, is single, and suffices alone to be the foundation of our reasoning and judgment; whereas in the latter the signs are numerous, and decide little or nothing when alone and unaccompany'd with many minute circumstances, which are almost imperceptible. But 'tis certainly true, that any reasoning is always the more convincing, the more single and united it is to the eye, and the less exercise it gives to the imagination to collect all its parts, and run from them to the correlative idea, which forms the conclusion. The labour of the thought disturbs the regular progress of the sentiments, as we shall observe presently. The idea strikes not on us with such vivacity; and consequently has no such influence on the passion and imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在阐述了公开和隐蔽的奉承或讽刺的不同影响之后，我还要考虑另一个与之相似的现象。在男人和女人的荣誉问题上，有许多细节，当他们的违法行为被公开宣布时，世界不会原谅他们，但当表面上被拯救，而违法行为被秘密隐藏时，他们更容易忽视。即使是那些同样肯定地知道犯有过错的人，当证据在某种程度上似乎是斜的和含糊的时候，也比直接和不可否认的时候更容易原谅它。在这两种情况下，都提出了同样的观点，而且，正确地说，同样得到了判决的认可；但由于提出的方式不同，其影响也不同。现在，如果我们比较这两种情况，即<i class="calibre10">公开</i>和<i class="calibre10">隐蔽</i>地违反荣誉法的情况，我们会发现，它们之间的区别在于：在第一种情况下，我们据以推断应受谴责的行为的迹象是单一的，仅此就足以成为我们推理和判断的基础；而在第二种情况下，迹象是众多的，当单独和没有与许多细微的情况相伴，几乎无法决定什么。但是，毫无疑问，任何推理总是越有说服力，对眼睛来说越是单一和统一的，越是不需要想象力去收集它的所有部分，并从它们跑到相关的想法，从而形成结论。思想的劳作扰乱了情感的正常发展，我们将在下文中看到这一点。思想对我们的冲击没有那么大，因此对激情和想象力没有那么大的影响。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus it appears upon the whole, that every kind of opinion or judgment, which amounts not to knowledge, is deriv'd entirely from the force and vivacity of the perception, and that these qualities constitute in the mind, what we call the belief of the existence of any object. This force and this vivacity are most conspicuous in the memory; and therefore our confidence in the veracity of that faculty is the greatest imaginable, and equals in many respects the assurance of a demonstration. The next degree of these qualities is that deriv'd from the relation of cause and effect; and this too is very great, especially when the conjunction is found by experience to be perfectly constant, and when the object, which is present to us, exactly resembles those, of which we have had experience. But below this degree of evidence there are many others, which have an influence on the passions and imagination, proportion'd to that degree of force and vivacity, which they communicate to the ideas. 'Tis by habit we make the transition from cause to effect; and 'tis from some present impression we borrow that vivacity, which we diffuse over the correlative idea. But when we have not observ'd a sufficient number of instances, to produce a strong habit; or when these instances are contrary to each other; or when the resemblance is not exact; or the present impression is faint and obscure; or the experience in some measure obliterated from the memory; or the connexion dependent on a long chain of objects; or the inference deriv'd from general rules, and yet not conformable to them: In all these cases the evidence diminishes by the diminution of the force and in tenseness of the idea.

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，从整体上看，每一种不属于知识的意见或判断，都完全来自于感知的力量和活力，而这些品质在头脑中构成了我们所说的对任何物体存在的信念。这种力量和活力在记忆中最为明显；因此，我们对这种能力的真实性的信心是可以想象的最大的，在许多方面等同于证明的保证。这些品质的下一个程度是由因果关系派生出来的；这也是非常大的，特别是当经验发现这种结合是完全恒定的，以及当呈现在我们面前的对象与我们有经验的对象完全相似的时候。但是，在这种程度的证据之下，还有许多其他的证据，它们对激情和想象力的影响，与它们传递给观念的力量和活力的程度成正比。我们是通过习惯来实现从因到果的过渡的；我们是从一些当前的印象中借来的活力，我们把它散布在相关的想法上。但是，当我们没有观察到足够多的实例，以产生强烈的习惯时；或者当这些实例彼此相反时；或者当相似性不确切时；或者目前的印象是微弱和模糊的；或者经验在某种程度上从记忆中被抹去了；或者这种联系取决于一长串的对象；或者推论来自一般规则，但又不符合它们。在所有这些情况下，证据都会因思想的力量和紧张程度的减弱而减少。因此，这就是判断和概率的本质。</p></div>

'Tis indeed evident, that in all determinations, where the mind decides from contrary experiments, 'tis first divided within itself, and has an inclination to either side in proportion to the number of experiments we have seen and remember. This contest is at last determin'd to the advantage of that side, where we observe a superior number of these experiments; but still with a diminution of force in the evidence correspondent to the number of the opposite experiments.

In order to this I consider, in what objects necessity is commonly suppos'd to lie; and finding that it is always ascrib'd to causes and effects, I turn my eye to two objects suppos'd to be plac'd in that relation; and examine them in all the situations, of which they are susceptible. I immediately perceive, that they are <i class="calibre10">contiguous</i> in time and place, and that the object we call cause <i class="calibre10">precedes</i> the other we call effect. In no one instance can I go any farther, nor is it possible for me to discover any third relation betwixt these objects. I therefore enlarge my view to comprehend several instances; where I find like objects always existing in like relations of contiguity and succession. At first sight this seems to serve but little to my purpose. The reflection on several instances only repeats the same objects; and therefore can never give rise to a new idea. But upon farther enquiry I find, that the repetition is not in every particular the same, but produces a new impression, and by that means the idea, which I at present examine. For after a frequent repetition, I find, that upon the appearance of one of the objects, the mind is <i class="calibre10">determin'd</i> by custom to consider its usual attendant, and to consider it in a stronger light upon account of its relation to the first object.

If we pretend, therefore, to have any just idea of this efficacy, we must produce some instance, wherein the efficacy is plainly discoverable to the mind, and its operations obvious to our consciousness or sensation. By the refusal of this, we acknowledge, that the idea is impossible and imaginary; since the principle of innate ideas, which alone can save us from this dilemma, has been already refuted, and is now almost universally rejected in the learned world.

There are some, who maintain, that bodies operate by their substantial form; others, by their accidents or qualities; several, by their matter and form; some, by their form and accidents; others, by certain virtues and faculties distinct from all this. All these sentiments again are mix'd and vary'd in a thousand different ways; and form a strong presumption, that none of them have any solidity or evidence. and that the supposition of an efficacy in any of the known qualities of matter is entirely without foundation. This presumption must encrease upon us, when we consider, that these principles of substantial forms, and accidents, and faculties, are not in reality any of the known properties of bodies, but are perfectly unintelligible and inexplicable. For 'tis evident philosophers wou'd never have had recourse to such obscure and uncertain principles had they met with any satisfaction in such as are clear and intelligible; especially in such an affair as this, which must be an object of the simplest understanding, if not of the senses. Upon the whole, we may conclude, that 'tis impossible in any one instance to shew the principle, in which the force and agency of a cause is plac'd; and that the most refin'd and most vulgar understandings are equally at a loss in this particular. If any one think proper to refute this assertion, he need not put himself to the trouble of inventing any long reasonings; but may at once shew us an instance of a cause, where we discover the power or operating principle.

In this opinion they are almost unanimous; and 'tis only in the inference they draw from it, that they discover any difference in their sentiments. For some of them, as the <i class="calibre10">Cartesians</i> in particular, having establish'd it as a principle, that we are perfectly acquainted with the essence of matter, have very naturally inferr'd, that it is endow'd with no efficacy, and that 'tis impossible for it of itself to communicate motion, or produce any of those effects, which we ascribe to it.

		<p class="block_6 en">This conclusion leads them into another, which they regard as perfectly unavoidable. Matter, say they, is in itself entirely unactive, and depriv' d of any power, by which it may produce, or continue, or communicate motion: But since these effects are evident to our senses, and since the power, that produces them, must be plac'd somewhere, it must lie in the Deity, or that divine being, who contains in his nature all excellency and perfection. 'Tis the deity, therefore, who is the prime mover of the universe, and who not only first created matter, and gave it it's original impulse, but likewise by a continu'd exertion of omnipotence, supports its existence, and successively bestows on it all those motions, and configurations, and qualities, with which it is endow'd.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This opinion is certainly very curious, and well worth our attention; but 'twill appear superfluous to examine it in this place, if we reflect a moment on our present purpose in taking notice of it. We have establish'd it as a principle, that as all ideas are deriv'd from impressions, or some precedent <i class="calibre10">perceptions</i>, 'tis impossible we can have any idea of power and efficacy, unless some instances can be produc'd, wherein this power <i class="calibre10">is perceiv'd</i> to exert itself. Now as these instances can never be discover'd in body, the <i class="calibre10">Cartesians</i>, proceeding upon their principle of innate ideas, have had recourse to a supreme spirit or deity, whom they consider as the only active being in the universe, and as the immediate cause of every alteration in matter. But the principle of innate ideas being allow'd to be false, it follows, that the supposition of a deity can serve us in no stead, in accounting for that idea of agency, which we search for in vain in all the objects, which are presented to our senses, or which we are internally conscious of in our own minds. For if every idea be deriv'd from an impression, the idea of a deity proceeds from the same origin; and if no impression, either of sensation or reflection, implies any force or efficacy, 'tis equally impossible to discover or even imagine any such active principle in the deity. Since these philosophers, therefore, have concluded, that matter cannot be endow'd with any efficacious principle, because 'tis impossible to discover in it such a principle; the same course of reasoning shou'd determine them to exclude it from the supreme being. Or if they estem that opinion absurd and impious, as it really is, I shall tell them how they may avoid it; and that is, by concluding from the very first, that they have no adequate idea of power or efficacy in any object; since neither in body nor spirit, neither in superior nor inferior natures, are they able to discover one single instance of it.</p>

If we have really an idea of power, we may attribute power to an unknown quality: But as 'tis impossible, that that idea can be deriv'd from such a quality, and as there is nothing in known qualities, which can produce it; it follows that we deceive ourselves, when we imagine we are possest of any idea of this kind, after the manner we commonly understand it.

If we be possest, therefore, of any idea of power in general, we must also be able to conceive some particular species of it; and as power cannot subsist alone, but is always regarded as an attribute of some being or existence, we must be able to place this power in some particular being, and conceive that being as endow'd with a real force and energy, by which such a particular effect necessarily results from its operation. We must distinctly and particularly conceive the connexion betwixt the cause and effect, and be able to pronounce, from a simple view of the one, that it must be follow'd or preceded by the other. This is the true manner of conceiving a particular power in a particular body: and a general idea being impossible without an individual; where the latter is impossible, 'tis certain the former can never exist. Now nothing is more evident, than that the human mind cannot form such an idea of two objects, as to conceive any connexion betwixt them, or comprehend distinctly that power or efficacy, by which they are united. Such a connexion wou'd amount to a demonstration, and wou'd imply the absolute impossibility for the one object not to follow, or to be conceiv'd not to follow upon the other: Which kind of connexion has already been rejected in all cases. If any one is of a contrary opinion, and thinks he has attain'd a notion of power in any particular object, I desire he may point out to me that object.

In order, then, to understand the idea of power, we must consider that multiplicity; nor do I ask more to give a solution of that difficulty, which has so long perplex'd us. For thus I reason. The repetition of perfectly similar instances can never alone give rise to an original idea, different from what is to be found in any particular instance, as has been observ'd, and as evidently follows from our fundamental principle, <i class="calibre10">that all ideas are copy'd from impressions</i>. </p>

I am, indeed, ready to allow, that there may be several qualities both in material and immaterial objects, with which we are utterly unacquainted; and if we please to call these <i class="calibre10">power</i> or <i class="calibre10">efficacy</i>, 'twill be of little consequence to the world. But when, instead of meaning these unknown qualities, we make the terms of power and efficacy signify something, of which we have a clear idea, and which is incompatible with those objects, to which we apply it, obscurity and error begin then to take place, and we are led astray by a false philosophy. This is the case, when we transfer the determination of the thought to external objects, and suppose any real intelligible connexion betwixt them; that being a quality, which can only belong to the mind that considers them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对于所有这些论点，我只能回答说，这里的情况是一样的，就好像一个盲人假装在假设中发现了许多荒谬之处，即大红的颜色与喇叭的声音不一样，光与固体也不一样。如果我们真的不知道任何物体的力量或功效，或者不知道因果之间的任何真正联系，那么证明功效在所有行动中都是必要的，就没有什么意义了。我们这样说并不理解自己的意思，而是无知地混淆了彼此完全不同的概念。我确实愿意承认，在物质和非物质的物体中，可能有一些我们完全不了解的品质；如果我们愿意把这些品质称为<i class="calibre10">力量</i>或<i class="calibre10">功效</i>，那对世界就没有什么影响了。但是，当我们不是指这些未知的品质，而是让权力和效力这两个词表示一些我们有明确概念的东西，而这些东西与我们所适用的对象不相容时，就会开始出现模糊和错误，我们就会被错误的哲学引入歧途。当我们把思想的决定权转移到外部物体上，并假设它们之间有任何真正可理解的联系时，情况就是这样；那是一种品质，只能属于考虑它们的头脑。</p></div>

But if we go any farther, and ascribe a power or necessary connexion to these objects; this is what we can never observe in them, but must draw the idea of it from what we feel internally in contemplating them.

We may define a cause to be 'An object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are plac'd in like relations of precedence and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter.' If this definition be esteem'd defective, because drawn from objects foreign to the cause, we may substitute this other definition in its place, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> 'A cause is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other.' Shou'd this definition also be rejected for the same reason, I know no other remedy, than that the persons, who express this delicacy, should substitute a juster definition in its place. But for my part I must own my incapacity for such an undertaking. When I examine with the utmost accuracy those objects, which are commonly denominated causes and effects, I find, in considering a single instance, that the one object is precedent and contiguous to the other; and in enlarging my view to consider several instances, I find only, that like objects are constantly plac'd in like relations of succession and contiguity. Again, when I consider the influence of this constant conjunction, I perceive, that such a relation can never be an object of reasoning, and can never operate upon the mind, but by means of custom, which determines the imagination to make a transition from the idea of one object to that of its usual attendant, and from the impression of one to a more lively idea of the other. However extraordinary these sentiments may appear, I think it fruitless to trouble myself with any farther enquiry or reasoning upon the subject, but shall repose myself on them as on establish'd maxims.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对这种关系可以有两个定义，它们的不同之处在于对同一对象提出了不同的看法，并使我们把它看作是一种<i class="calibre10">哲学</i>关系或<i class="calibre10">自然</i>关系；或者看作是两个概念的比较，或者看作是它们之间的一种联系。我们可以把原因定义为：“一个物体在另一个物体之前并与之相邻，而且所有与前者相似的物体都与后者相似的物体有相似的优先权和相邻关系。如果这个定义被认为是有缺陷的，因为它来自于与原因无关的物体，我们可以用另一个定义来代替它，即<i class="calibre10">：</i>'原因是一个物体在另一个物体之前并与之相邻，并且与之结合，一个物体的概念决定了心灵形成另一个物体的概念，一个物体的印象形成另一个物体的更生动的概念。如果这个定义也因为同样的原因被拒绝，我不知道还有什么补救办法，只能让表达这种微妙的人用一个更公正的定义来代替它。但就我而言，我必须承认我没有能力做这样的工作。当我以最准确的方式研究那些通常被称为原因和结果的对象时，我发现，在考虑一个例子时，一个对象是先于另一个对象的，并与之相邻；而当我扩大视野考虑几个例子时，我只发现，类似的对象不断被置于类似的继承和相邻关系中。此外，当我考虑到这种不断结合的影响时，我意识到，这种关系永远不会成为推理的对象，也永远不会作用于心灵，而是通过习惯的方式，决定想象力从一个物体的概念过渡到其通常的伴随物，从一个物体的印象过渡到另一个物体的更生动的概念。无论这些观点看起来多么不寻常，我认为在这个问题上进行任何进一步的调查或推理都是徒劳的，而应该把自己放在这些既定的格言上。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Twill only be proper, before we leave this subject, to draw some corollaries from it, by which we may remove several prejudices and popular errors, that have very much prevail'd in philosophy. First, We may learn from the foregoing doctrine, that all causes are of the same kind, and that in particular there is no foundation for that distinction, which we sometimes make betwixt efficient causes, and causes <i class="calibre10">sine qua non</i>; or betwixt efficient causes, and formal, and material, and exemplary, and final causes. For as our idea of efficiency is deriv'd from the constant conjunction of two objects, wherever this is observ'd, the cause is efficient; and where it is not, there can never be a cause of any kind. For the same reason we must reject the distinction betwixt <i class="calibre10">cause</i> and <i class="calibre10">occasion</i>, when suppos'd to signify any thing essentially different from each other. If constant conjunction be imply'd in what we call occasion, 'tis a real cause. If not, 'tis no relation at all, and cannot give rise to any argument or reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们离开这个话题之前，只需从它那里得出一些推论，通过这些推论，我们可以消除哲学中非常普遍的一些偏见和流行的错误。首先，我们可以从上述学说中了解到，所有的原因都是同类的，特别是我们有时在有效原因和<i class="calibre10">必要条件</i>的原因之间所做的区分是没有根据的；或者在有效原因和形式的、物质的、模范的和最终的原因之间所做的区分是没有根据的。因为我们的效率观念是由两个物体的不断结合而来，只要观察到这一点，原因就是有效的；而如果不是这样，就不可能有任何形式的原因。出于同样的原因，我们必须拒绝区分<i class="calibre10">原因</i>和<i class="calibre10">场合</i>，因为这意味着任何本质上不同的东西。如果在我们所谓的场合中隐含着恒定的结合，那么它就是一个真正的原因。如果不是，就根本没有关系，也不能引起任何论证或推理。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, The same course of reasoning will make us conclude, that there is but one kind of <i class="calibre10">necessity</i>, as there is but one kind of cause, and that the common distinction betwixt <i class="calibre10">moral</i> and <i class="calibre10">physical</i> necessity is without any foundation in nature. This clearly appears from the precedent explication of necessity. 'Tis the constant conjunction of objects, along with the determination of the mind, which constitutes a physical necessity: And the removal of these is the same thing with <i class="calibre10">chance</i>. As objects must either be conjoin'd or not, and as the mind must either be determin'd or not to pass from one object to another, 'tis impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute necessity. In weakening this conjunction and determination you do not change the nature of the necessity; since even in the operation of bodies, these have different degrees of constancy and force, without producing a different species of that relation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，同样的推理过程将使我们得出结论，即只有一种<i class="calibre10">必然性</i>，就像只有一种原因一样，<i class="calibre10">道德</i>和<i class="calibre10">物理</i>必然性之间的共同区别在自然界中没有任何基础。这一点从前面对必然性的解释中可以清楚地看出。物体的不断结合，加上心灵的决定，构成了物理上的必然性。而消除这些是与<i class="calibre10">机会</i>相同的事情。由于物体必须结合或不结合，由于心灵必须决定或不决定从一个物体到另一个物体，所以不可能承认在机会和绝对必然性之间有任何媒介。在削弱这种结合和决定时，你并没有改变必然性的性质；因为即使在身体的运作中，这些都有不同程度的恒定性和力量，而没有产生这种关系的不同种类。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The distinction, which we often make betwixt <i class="calibre10">power</i> and the <i class="calibre10">exercise</i> of it, is equally without foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们经常在<i class="calibre10">权力</i>和<i class="calibre10">行使权力</i>之间做出区分，这同样是没有根据的。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, We may now be able fully to overcome all that repugnance, which 'tis so natural for us to entertain against the foregoing reasoning, by which we endeavour'd to prove, that the necessity of a cause to every beginning of existence is not founded on any arguments either demonstrative or intuitive. Such an opinion will not appear strange after the foregoing definitions. If we define a cause to be <i class="calibre10">an object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are plac'd in a like relation of priority and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter;</i> we may easily conceive, that there is no absolute nor metaphysical necessity, that every beginning of existence shou'd be attended with such an object. If we define a cause to be, <i class="calibre10">An object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it in the imagination, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other;</i> we shall make still less difficulty of assenting to this opinion. Such an influence on the mind is in itself perfectly extraordinary and incomprehensible; nor can we be certain of its reality, but from experience and observation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，我们现在可以完全克服我们对前述推理的反感，因为我们在前述推理中努力证明，每一个存在的开始都必须有一个原因，这不是建立在任何证明性或直观性的论据上。在前面的定义之后，这样的观点不会显得奇怪。如果我们把原因定义为<i class="calibre10">一个先于另一个物体并与之相邻的物体，并且所有与前者相似的物体都与后者相似的物体有类似的优先和相邻关系；</i>我们可以很容易地设想，没有绝对的或形而上学的必然性，即每一个存在的开始都应该有这样一个物体存在。如果我们把原因定义为：<i class="calibre10">一个物体在另一个物体之前，与之相邻，并在想象中与之结合，以至于一个物体的观念决定了心灵形成另一个物体的观念，一个物体的印象形成了另一个物体的更生动的观念；</i>我们同意这一观点的难度就会降低。这种对心灵的影响本身就是非常特别和不可理解的；除了经验和观察，我们也无法确定其真实性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall add as a fourth corollary, that we can never have reason to believe that any object exists, of which we cannot form an idea. For as all our reasonings concerning existence are deriv'd from causation, and as all our reasonings concerning causation are deriv'd from the experience'd conjunction of objects, not from any reasoning or reflection, the same experience must give us a notion of these objects, and must remove all mystery from our conclusions. This is so evident, that 'twou'd scarce have merited our attention, were it not to obviate certain objections of this kind, which might arise against the following reasonings concerning <i class="calibre10">matter</i> and <i class="calibre10">substance</i>. I need not observe, that a full knowledge of the object is not requisite, but only of those qualities of it, which we believe to exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将补充第四个推论，即我们永远没有理由相信任何我们无法形成概念的物体存在。因为我们所有关于存在的推理都来自于因果关系，而我们所有关于因果关系的推理都来自于物体的经验结合，而不是来自于任何推理或思考，同样的经验必须给我们一个关于这些物体的概念，并且必须从我们的结论中消除所有的神秘感。这一点非常明显，如果不是为了避免可能出现的某些反对意见，我们根本不值得注意，因为这些反对意见可能会对下面关于<i class="calibre10">物质</i>和<i class="calibre10">实质</i>的推理产生影响。我不需要指出，对物体的全面了解是不需要的，只需要了解我们认为存在的那些品质。</p></div>

Our scholastic headpieces and logicians shew no such superiority above the mere vulgar in their reason and ability, as to give us any inclination to imitate them in delivering a long system of rules and precepts to direct our judgment, in philosophy. All the rules of this nature are very easy in their invention, but extremely difficult in their application; and even experimental philosophy, which seems the most natural and simple of any, requires the utmost stretch of human judgment. There is no phænomenon in nature, but what is compounded and modify'd by so many different circumstances, that in order to arrive at the decisive point, we must carefully separate whatever is superfluous, and enquire by new experiments, if every particular circumstance of the first experiment was essential to it. These new experiments are liable to a discussion of the same kind; so that the utmost constancy is requir'd to make us persevere in our enquiry, and the utmost sagacity to choose the right way among so many that present themselves. If this be the case even in natural philosophy, how much more in moral, where there is a much greater complication of circumstances, and where those views and sentiments, which are essential to any action of the mind, are so implicit and obscure, that they often escape our strictest attention, and are not only unaccountable in their causes, but even unknown in their existence?

		<p class="block_6 en">Next to the ridicule of denying an evident truth, is that of taking much pains to defend it; and no truth appears to me more evident, than that beasts are endow'd with thought and reason as well as men. The arguments are in this case so obvious, that they never escape the most stupid and ignorant.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">除了否认一个明显的真理的嘲笑之外，还有费尽心思为其辩护的嘲笑；在我看来，没有什么真理比野兽和人一样具有思想和理性更明显了。在这种情况下，论据是如此明显，以至于最愚蠢和最无知的人都无法逃脱。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We are conscious, that we ourselves, in adapting means to ends, are guided by reason and design, and that 'tis not ignorantly nor casually we perform those actions, which tend to self-preservation, to the obtaining pleasure, and avoiding pain. When therefore we see other creatures, in millions of instances, perform like actions, and direct them to like ends, all our principles of reason and probability carry us with an invincible force to believe the existence of a like cause. 'Tis needless in my opinion to illustrate this argument by the enumeration of particulars. The smallest attention will supply us with more than are requisite. The resemblance betwixt the actions of animals and those of men is so entire in this respect, that the very first action of the first animal we shall please to pitch on, will afford us an incontestable argument for the present doctrine.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们意识到，我们自己在使手段与目的相适应时，是由理性和设计指导的，而且我们并非无知或随意地采取那些行动，以利于自我保护，获得快乐，避免痛苦。因此，当我们看到其他生物在数以百万计的例子中做出类似的行为，并将它们引向类似的目的时，我们所有的理性和概率原则就会以一种不可战胜的力量让我们相信存在着类似的原因。在我看来，没有必要通过列举具体事例来说明这一论点。我们只要稍加注意，就能得到更多必要的信息。在这方面，动物的行动和人的行动之间的相似性是如此之大，以至于我们要讨论的第一种动物的第一个行动就能为目前的学说提供一个无可争议的论据。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This doctrine is as useful as it is obvious, and furnishes us with a kind of touchstone, by which we may try every system in this species of philosophy. 'Tis from the resemblance of the external actions of animals to those we ourselves perform, that we judge their internal likewise to resemble ours; and the same principle of reasoning, carry'd one step farther, will make us conclude that since our internal actions resemble each other, the causes, from which they are deriv'd, must also be resembling. When any hypothesis, therefore, is advanc'd to explain a mental operation, which is common to men and beasts, we must apply the same hypothesis to both; and as every true hypothesis will abide this trial, so I may venture to affirm, that no false one will ever be able to endure it. The common defect of those systems, which philosophers have employ'd to account for the actions of the mind, is, that they suppose such a subtility and refinement of thought, as not only exceeds the capacity of mere animals, but even of children and the common people in our own species; who are notwithstanding susceptible of the same emotions and affections as persons of the most accomplish'd genius and understanding. Such a subtility is a clear proof of the falshood, as the contrary simplicity of the truth, of any system.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个学说既有用又明显，为我们提供了一种试金石，我们可以据此检验这种哲学的每一个体系。正是由于动物的外部行为与我们自己的行为相似，我们才判断它们的内部行为与我们的内部行为相似；同样的推理原则，再往前走一步，就会使我们得出结论，既然我们的内部行为彼此相似，那么它们所产生的原因也一定是相似的。因此，当任何假说被提出来解释人和动物所共有的心理活动时，我们必须将同样的假说应用于两者；由于每个真正的假说都能经受住这种考验，所以我可以大胆地说，没有一个假说能够经受住这种考验。哲学家们用来解释思想行为的那些系统的共同缺陷是，他们假定思想的微妙性和精致性，不仅超过了单纯的动物的能力，甚至超过了我们这个物种中的儿童和普通人的能力；尽管如此，他们还是有可能拥有与最有天赋和理解力的人一样的情感和情操。这样的微妙性清楚地证明了任何系统的虚假性，就像真理的相反简单性一样。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Let us therefore put our present system concerning the nature of the understanding to this decisive trial, and see whether it will equally account for the reasonings of beasts as for these of the human species.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，让我们把我们目前关于理解力的性质的系统放在这个决定性的试验中，看看它是否能同样解释野兽的推理和人类的推理。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here we must make a distinction betwixt those actions of animals, which are of a vulgar nature, and seem to be on a level with their common capacities, and those more extraordinary instances of sagacity, which they sometimes discover for their own preservation, and the propagation of their species. A dog, that avoids fire and precipices, that shuns strangers, and caresses his master, affords us an instance of the first kind. A bird, that chooses with such care and nicety the place and materials of her nest, and sits upon her eggs for a due time, and in a suitable season, with all the precaution that a chymist is capable of in the most delicate projection, furnishes us with a lively instance of the second.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这里，我们必须区分动物的那些行为，这些行为具有粗俗的性质，似乎与它们的普通能力持平，而那些更特殊的智慧实例，它们有时为了保护自己和繁殖自己的物种而发现。一只狗，避开火和悬崖，避开陌生人，爱抚它的主人，为我们提供了第一类的例子。一只鸟，如此小心谨慎地选择它的巢穴的位置和材料，在适当的时间和适当的季节坐在她的蛋上，在最微妙的投射中，以一个糜烂者所能做到的所有预防措施，为我们提供了一个生动的第二种例子。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As to the former actions, I assert they proceed from a reasoning, that is not in itself different, nor founded on different principles, from that which appears in human nature. 'Tis necessary in the first place, that there be some impression immediately present to their memory or senses, in order to be the foundation of their judgment. From the tone of voice the dog infers his master's anger, and foresees his own punishment. From a certain sensation affecting his smell, he judges his game not to be far distant from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">至于以前的行为，我断言它们来自于一种推理，这种推理本身并没有什么不同，也没有建立在不同的原则上，与人类本性中出现的推理不同。首先，必须有一些印象立即呈现在他们的记忆或感官中，以便成为他们判断的基础。狗从说话的语气中推断出主人的愤怒，并预感到对自己的惩罚。根据影响其嗅觉的某种感觉，它判断其猎物离它不远了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, The inference he draws from the present impression is built on experience, and on his observation of the conjunction of objects in past instances. As you vary this experience, he varies his reasoning. Make a beating follow upon one sign or motion for some time, and afterwards upon another; and he will successively draw different conclusions, according to his most recent experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，他从现在的印象中得出的推论是建立在经验上的，是建立在他对过去事例中物体结合的观察上的。当你改变这种经验时，他也会改变他的推理。让一个人在一个标志或运动上跳动一段时间，然后在另一个标志或运动上跳动；他就会根据他最近的经验连续得出不同的结论。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now let any philosopher make a trial, and endeavour to explain that act of the mind, which we call <i class="calibre10">belief</i> and give an account of the principles, from which it is deriv'd, independent of the influence of custom on the imagination, and let his hypothesis be equally applicable to beasts as to the human species; and after he has done this, I promise to embrace his opinion. But at the same time I demand as an equitable condition, that if my system be the only one, which can answer to all these terms, it may be receiv'd as entirely satisfactory and convincing. And that 'tis the only one, is evident almost without any reasoning. Beasts certainly never perceive any real connexion among objects. 'Tis therefore by experience they infer one from another. They can never by any arguments form a general conclusion, that those objects, of which they have had no experience, resemble those of which they have. 'Tis therefore by means of custom alone, that experience operates upon them. All this was sufficiently evident with respect to man. But with respect to beasts there cannot be the least suspicion of mistake; which must be own'd to be a strong confirmation, or rather an invincible proof of my system.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，让任何一位哲学家进行试验，努力解释我们称之为<i class="calibre10">信仰</i>的心灵行为，并说明它所依据的原则，不受习俗对想象力的影响，而且让他的假设同样适用于野兽和人类；在他做完这些之后，我保证会接受他的意见。但同时，我要求作为一个公平的条件，如果我的体系是唯一一个能够满足所有这些条件的体系，它可以被认为是完全令人满意和令人信服的。而这是唯一的一种，几乎不需要任何推理就可以看出。动物当然不会察觉到物体之间有任何真正的联系。因此，它们是通过经验来推断一个又一个的。它们不可能通过任何论据形成一个一般性的结论，即那些它们没有经验的物体与它们有经验的物体相似。因此，只有通过习俗，经验才会对他们产生作用。这一切对人来说是足够明显的。但对于野兽，却不能有丝毫错误的怀疑；这必须被认为是对我的体系的有力证实，或者说是一个不可战胜的证明。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing shews more the force of habit in reconciling us to any phænomenon, than this, that men are not astonish'd at the operations of their own reason, at the same time, that they admire the <i class="calibre10">instinct</i> of animals, and find a difficulty in explaining it, merely because it cannot be reduc'd to the very same principles. To consider the matter aright, reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations. This instinct, 'tis true, arises from past observation and experience; but can any one give the ultimate reason, why past experience and observation produces such an effect, any more than why nature alone shou'd produce it? Nature may certainly produce whatever can arise from habit: Nay, habit is nothing but one of the principles of nature, and derives all its force from that origin.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">没有什么比这更能说明习惯在使我们与任何现象相协调方面的力量了，即人们对自己的理性的运作并不感到惊讶，同时，他们对动物的<i class="calibre10">本能</i>感到钦佩，并认为难以解释它，只是因为它不能被归结为同样的原则。正确地考虑这个问题，理性不过是我们的一种奇妙的、难以理解的本能，它带着我们沿着一定的思路走，并根据它们的特殊情况和关系，赋予它们特殊的品质。诚然，这种本能来自于过去的观察和经验；但有谁能给出最终的理由，为什么过去的经验和观察会产生这样的效果，而不是只有自然界才会产生这样的效果？自然当然可以产生任何可以从习惯中产生的东西。不，习惯只不过是自然的原则之一，它的所有力量都来自于自然。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In all demonstrative sciences the rules are certain and infallible; but when we apply them, our fallible and uncertain faculties are very apt to depart from them, and fall into error. We must, therefore, in every reasoning form a new judgment, as a check or controul on our first judgment or belief; and must enlarge our view to comprehend a kind of history of all the instances, wherein our understanding has deceiv'd us, compar'd with those, wherein its testimony was just and true. Our reason must be consider'd as a kind of cause, of which truth is the natural effect; but such-a-one as by the irruption of other causes, and by the inconstancy of our mental powers, may frequently be prevented. By this means all knowledge degenerates into probability; and this probability is greater or less, according to our experience of the veracity or deceitfulness of our understanding, and according to the simplicity or intricacy of the question.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在所有论证科学中，规则是确定的和无懈可击的；但当我们应用它们时，我们易变的和不确定的能力很容易偏离它们，并陷入错误。因此，我们必须在每次推理中形成一个新的判断，作为对我们第一个判断或信仰的检查或反驳；必须扩大我们的视野，以包括一种历史，即我们的理解力欺骗了我们的所有事例，与那些它的证词是公正和真实的事例进行比较。我们的理性必须被视为一种原因，而真理是这种原因的自然结果；但由于其他原因的干扰，以及我们精神力量的不稳定，这种原因可能经常被阻止。通过这种方式，所有的知识都退化为可能性；这种可能性或大或小，取决于我们对自己理解力的真实性或欺骗性的经验，也取决于问题的简单性或复杂性。</p></div>

Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more by the approbation of his friends; and is rais'd to its utmost perfection by the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now 'tis evident, that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the addition of new probabilities, and is deriv'd from the constant union of causes and effects, according to past experience and observation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">没有一个代数学家或数学家在他的科学中如此专业，以至于在发现任何真理时立即对其抱有完全的信心，或将其视为任何东西，而仅仅是一种概率。每当他仔细研究他的证明时，他的信心就会增加；但由于他的朋友的认可，他的信心就会增加；并且由于学问界的普遍赞同和掌声，他的信心就会达到最完美的程度。现在很明显，这种信心的逐渐增强只不过是新的可能性的增加，是根据过去的经验和观察，从原因和结果的不断结合中得到的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In accompts of any length or importance, Merchants seldom trust to the infallible certainty of numbers for their security; but by the artificial structure of the accompts, produce a probability beyond what is deriv'd from the skill and experience of the accomptant. For that is plainly of itself some degree of probability; tho' uncertain and variable, according to the degrees of his experience and length of the accompt. Now as none will maintain, that our assurance in a long numeration exceeds probability, I may safely affirm, that there scarce is any proposition concerning numbers, of which we can have a fuller security. For 'tis easily possible, by gradually diminishing the numbers, to reduce the longest series of addition to the most simple question, which can be form'd, to an addition of two single numbers; and upon this supposition we shall find it impracticable to shew the precise limits of knowledge and of probability, or discover that particular number, at which the one ends and the other begins. But knowledge and probability are of such contrary and disagreeing natures, that they cannot well run insensibly into each other, and that because they will not divide, but must be either entirely present, or entirely absent. Besides, if any single addition were certain, every one wou'd be so, and consequently the whole or total sum; unless the whole can be different from all its parts. I had almost said, that this was certain; but I reflect, that it must reduce <i class="calibre10">itself</i>, as well as every other reasoning, and from knowledge degenerate into probability.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在任何长度或重要性的交易中，商人很少相信数字的无误确定性来保证他们的安全；而是通过交易的人为结构，产生一种超越交易员的技能和经验的可能性。因为这本身就是某种程度的概率；尽管根据他的经验程度和伴奏的长短，是不确定的和可变的。既然没有人坚持认为我们对长数的保证超过了概率，我可以肯定地说，很少有关于数字的命题，我们可以有更充分的保证。因为通过逐渐减少数字，很容易将最长的加法系列减少到最简单的问题，可以形成两个单一数字的加法；在这种假设下，我们会发现显示知识和概率的精确界限是不切实际的，或者发现那个特定的数字，在那里一个结束，另一个开始。但是，知识和概率的性质是如此的相反和不一致，以至于它们不可能不约而同地相互影响，这是因为它们不会分裂，而必须要么完全存在，要么完全不存在。此外，如果任何一个加数都是确定的，那么每一个加数都是如此，因此整体或总和也是如此；除非整体能与它的所有部分不同。我几乎说过，这是确定的；但我想，它必须像其他推理一样缩小<i class="calibre10">自己</i>，从知识退化为概率。</p></div>

'Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future. Here then arises a new species of probability to correct and regulate the first, and fix its just standard and proportion. As demonstration is subject to the controul of probability, so is probability liable to a new correction by a reflex act of the mind, wherein the nature of our understanding, and our reasoning from the first probability become our objects.</p>

This is a doubt, which immediately occurs to us, and of which, if we wou'd closely pursue our reason, we cannot avoid giving a decision. But this decision, tho' it shou'd be favourable to our preceding judgment, being founded only on probability, must weaken still further our first evidence, and must itself be weaken'd by a fourth doubt of the same kind, and so on <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>; till at last there remain nothing of the original probability, however great we may suppose it to have been, and however small the diminution by every new uncertainty. No finite Object can subsist under a decrease repeated <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>; and even the vastest quantity, which can enter into human imagination, must in this manner be reduc'd to nothing. Let our first belief be never so strong, it must infallibly perish by passing thro' so many new examinations, of which each diminishes somewhat of its force and vigour. When I reflect on the natural fallibility of my judgment, I have less confidence in my opinions, than when I only consider the objects concerning which I reason; and when I proceed still farther, to turn the scrutiny against every successive estimation I make of my faculties, all the rules of logic require a continual diminution, and at last a total extinction of belief and evidence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But here, perhaps, it may be demanded, how it happens, even upon my hypothesis, that these arguments above explain'd produce not a total suspense of judgment, and after what manner the mind ever retains a degree of assurance in any subject? For as these new probabilities, which by their repetition perpetually diminish the original evidence, are founded on the very same principles, whether of thought or sensation, as the primary judgment, it may seem unavoidable, that in either case they must equally subvert it, and by the opposition, either of contrary thoughts or sensations, reduce the mind to a total uncertainty. I suppose, there is some question propos'd to me, and that after revolving over the impressions of my memory and senses, and carrying my thoughts from them to such objects, as are commonly conjoin'd with them, I feel a stronger and more forcible conception on the one side, than on the other. This strong conception forms my first decision. I suppose, that afterwards I examine my judgment itself, and observing from experience, that 'tis sometimes just and sometimes erroneous, I consider it as regulated by contrary principles or causes, of which some lead to truth, and some to error; and in balancing these contrary causes, I diminish by a new probability the assurance of my first decision. This new probability is liable to the same diminution as the foregoing, and so on, <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>. 'Tis therefore demanded, <i class="calibre10">how it happens, that even after all we retain a degree of belief, which is sufficient for our purpose, either in philosophy or common life</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，在这里，也许有人会问，即使根据我的假设，上面解释的这些论据怎么会不产生判断的完全悬念，以及在任何问题上，心灵是以何种方式保持一定程度的确信？因为这些新的可能性，由于它们的重复而不断减少原来的证据，无论是思想还是感觉，都是建立在与主要判断相同的原则之上的，所以似乎不可避免的是，在任何一种情况下，它们都必须同样地颠覆它，并通过相反的思想或感觉的对抗，使头脑完全陷入不确定状态。我假设，有一些问题向我提出，在我的记忆和感官的印象上转了一圈，并把我的想法从它们带到通常与它们联系在一起的对象上，我感到一边的概念比另一边的概念更强烈、更有说服力。这种强烈的概念形成了我的第一个决定。我假设，之后我检查我的判断本身，并从经验中观察到，它有时是公正的，有时是错误的，我认为它是由相反的原则或原因控制的，其中一些导致真理，一些导致错误；在平衡这些相反的原因时，我通过一个新的可能性减少了我第一个决定的确定性。这个新的可能性也会像前述那样被削弱，如此循环往复，<i class="calibre10">无穷无尽</i>。因此，有人问，<i class="calibre10">即使在所有的事情之后，我们仍然保留一定程度的信念，这对我们的目的来说是足够的，无论是在哲学上还是在普通生活中</i>。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I answer, that after the first and second decision; as the action of the mind becomes forc'd and unnatural, and the ideas faint and obscure; tho' the principles of judgment, and the balancing of opposite causes be the same as at the very beginning; yet their influence on the imagination, and the vigour they add to, or diminish from the thought, is by no means equal. Where the mind reaches not its objects with easiness and facility, the same principles have not the same effect as in a more natural conception of the ideas; nor does the imagination feel a sensation, which holds any proportion with that which arises from its common judgments and opinions. The attention is on the stretch: The posture of the mind is uneasy; and the spirits being diverted from their natural course, are not govern'd in their movements by the same laws, at least not to the same degree, as when they How in their usual channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我回答说，在第一次和第二次决定之后，由于心灵的行动变得强硬和不自然，思想变得模糊和晦涩；尽管判断的原则和相反原因的平衡与一开始一样；但它们对想象力的影响，以及它们对思想的增减，决不是平等的。在心灵不能轻松自如地达到其目标的地方，同样的原则就不能像在一个更自然的观念中那样产生影响；想象力也没有感觉，与从其共同的判断和意见中产生的感觉有任何比例。人们的注意力都集中在伸展上。心灵的姿态是不安的；精神偏离了它们的自然路线，它们的运动不受相同规律的支配，至少不受相同程度的支配，就像它们在通常的渠道中那样。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">If we desire similar instances, 'twill not be very difficult to find them. The present subject of metaphysics will supply us abundantly. The same argument, which wou'd have been esteem'd convincing in a reasoning concerning history or politics, has little or no influence in these abstruser subjects, even tho' it be perfectly comprehended; and that because there is requir'd a study and an effort of thought, in order to its being comprehended: And this effort of thought disturbs the operation of our sentiments, on which the belief depends. The case is the same in other subjects. The straining of the imagination always hinders the regular flowing of the passions and sentiments. A tragic poet, that wou'd represent his heroes as very ingenious and witty in their misfortunes, wou'd never touch the passions. As the emotions of the soul prevent any subtile reasoning and reflection, so these latter actions of the mind are equally prejudicial to the former. The mind, as well as the body, seems to be endow'd with a certain precise degree of force and activity, which it never employs in one action, but at the expence of all the rest. This is more evidently true, where the actions are of quite different natures; since in that case the force of the mind is not only diverted, but even the disposition chang'd, so as to render us incapable of a sudden transition from one action to the other, and still more of performing both at once. No wonder, then, the conviction, which arises from a subtile reasoning, diminishes in proportion to the efforts, which the imagination makes to enter into the reasoning, and to conceive it in all its parts. Belief, being a lively conception, can never be entire, where it is not founded on something natural and easy.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This I take to be the true state of the question, and cannot approve of that expeditious way, which some take with the sceptics, to reject at once all their arguments without enquiry or examination. If the sceptical reasonings be strong, say they, 'tis a proof, that reason may have some force and authority: if weak, they can never be sufficient to invalidate all the conclusions of our understanding. This argument is not just; because the sceptical reasonings, were it possible for them to exist, and were they not destroy'd by their subtility, wou'd be successively both strong and weak, according to the successive dispositions of the mind. Reason first appears in possession of the throne, prescribing laws, and imposing maxims, with an absolute sway and authority. Her enemy, therefore, is oblig'd to take shelter under her protection, and by making use of rational arguments to prove the fallaciousness and imbecility of reason, produces, in a manner, a patent under her hand and seal. This patent has at first an authority, proportion'd to the present and immediate authority of reason, from which it is deriv'd. But as it is suppos'd to be contradictory to reason, it gradually diminishes the force of that governing power, and its own at the same time; till at last they both vanish away into nothing, by a regular and just diminution. The sceptical and dogmatical reasons are of the same kind, tho' contrary in their operation and tendency; so that where the latter is strong, it has an enemy of equal force in the former to encounter; and as their forces were at first equal, they still continue so, as long as either of them subsists; nor does one of them lose any force in the contest, without taking as much from its antagonist. 'Tis happy, therefore, that nature breaks the force of all sceptical arguments in time, and keeps them from having any considerable influence on the understanding. Were we to trust entirely to their self-destruction, that can never take place, 'till they have first subverted all conviction, and have totally destroy'd human reason.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我认为这才是问题的真实情况，我不赞成有些人对怀疑论者采取的那种急功近利的做法，即不经询问或审查就立即拒绝他们的所有论据。他们说，如果怀疑论者的推理很强，那就证明理性可能有一定的力量和权威；如果很弱，它们就永远不足以使我们理解的所有结论失效。这个论点是不公正的；因为怀疑论的推理，如果有可能存在，如果没有被它们的微妙性所破坏，就会根据心灵的连续处置而先后变得既强又弱。理性首先出现在宝座上，规定法律，强加格言，具有绝对的支配力和权威。因此，她的敌人不得不躲在她的保护之下，并通过利用理性的论据来证明理性的谬误和无能，在某种程度上，产生了一个由她的手和印章的专利。这个专利起初有一个权威，与理性的当前和直接的权威相称，它是从理性派生出来的。但是，由于它被认为是与理性相矛盾的，所以它逐渐减少了支配力量的力量，同时也减少了它自己的力量；直到最后，它们都通过定期和公正的减少而消失得无影无踪。怀疑论和教条主义的理由也是如此，虽然它们的作用和趋势是相反的；因此，在后者强大的地方，它有一个与前者力量相等的敌人要对付；由于它们的力量最初是相等的，只要它们中的任何一个还存在，它们就仍然是这样；它们中的一个也不会在竞争中失去任何力量，而不从其对手那里得到同样的力量。因此，令人高兴的是，大自然及时打破了所有怀疑论点的力量，使它们无法对理解力产生任何重大影响。如果我们完全相信它们的自我毁灭，那是永远不可能的，"除非它们首先颠覆了所有的信念，并完全摧毁了人类的理性。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The subject, then, of our present enquiry is concerning the <i class="calibre10">causes</i> which induce us to believe in the existence of body: And my reasonings on this head I shall begin with a distinction, which at first sight may seem superfluous, but which will contribute very much to the perfect understanding of what follows. We ought to examine apart those two questions, which are commonly confounded together, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> Why we attribute a continu'd existence to objects, even when they are not present to the senses; and why we suppose them to have an existence distinct from the mind and perception. Under this last head I comprehend their situation as well as relations, their external position as well as the <i class="calibre10">independence</i> of their existence and operation. These two questions concerning the continu'd and distinct existence of body are intimately connected together. For if the objects of our senses continue to exist, even when they are not perceiv'd, their existence is of course independent of and distinct from the perception; and <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i>, if their existence be independent of the perception and distinct from it, they must continue to exist, even tho' they be not perceiv'd. But tho' the decision of the one question decides the other; yet that we may the more easily discover the principles of human nature, from whence the decision arises, we shall carry along with us this distinction, and shall consider, whether it be the <i class="calibre10">senses</i>, <i class="calibre10">reason</i>, or the <i class="calibre10">imagination</i>, that produces the opinion of a <i class="calibre10">continu'd</i> or of a <i class="calibre10">distinct</i> existence. These are the only questions, that are intelligible on the present subject. For as to the notion of external existence, when taken for something specifically different from our perceptions,  <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-232" id="calibre_link-380" title="28">28</a></sup>we have already shewn its absurdity.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，我们现在询问的主题是关于诱使我们相信身体存在的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>。我在这个问题上的推理将从一个区别开始，这个区别乍一看可能是多余的，但它将非常有助于对下文的完美理解。我们应该分别研究这两个通常被混为一谈的问题，<i class="calibre10">即：</i>为什么我们把物体的持续存在归结为，即使它们不在感官上；以及为什么我们认为它们有一个不同于心灵和知觉的存在。在这最后一个标题下，我理解了它们的情况和关系，它们的外部位置以及它们的存在和运作的<i class="calibre10">独立性</i>。这两个关于身体的持续和独特存在的问题是密切相关的。因为如果我们感官的对象继续存在，即使它们没有被感知，它们的存在当然是独立于感知并与之不同的；<i class="calibre10">反之亦然</i>，如果它们的存在独立于感知并与之不同，它们必须继续存在，即使它们没有被感知。但是，尽管一个问题的决定决定了另一个问题；但为了我们能更容易地发现人性的原则，即决定产生的原因，我们将带着这种区别，并将考虑是<i class="calibre10">感官</i>、<i class="calibre10">理性</i>还是<i class="calibre10">想象力</i>产生了<i class="calibre10">持续</i>存在或<i class="calibre10">独特</i>存在的观点。这些是唯一的问题，在目前的问题上是可以理解的。至于外部存在的概念，如果被认为是与我们的感知特别不同的东西，我们已经证明了它的荒谬。 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-232" id="calibre_link-380" title="28">28</a></sup>我们已经证明了其荒谬性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the senses, 'tis evident these faculties are incapable of giving rise to the notion of the <i class="calibre10">continu'd</i> existence of their objects, after they no longer appear to the senses. For that is a contradiction in terms, and supposes that the senses continue to operate, even after they have ceas'd all manner of operation. These faculties, therefore, if they have any influence in the present case, must produce the opinion of a distinct, not of a continu'd existence; and in order to that, must present their impressions either as images and representations, or as these very distinct and external existences.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从感官开始，很明显，这些能力不可能在它们的对象不再出现在感官面前时产生<i class="calibre10">持续</i>存在的概念。因为这是个矛盾的说法，它假定感官继续运作，甚至在它们停止了所有的运作方式之后。因此，这些能力，如果它们在目前的情况下有任何影响，就必须产生一个独特的，而不是持续存在的观点；为了达到这个目的，必须把它们的印象作为图像和代表，或者作为这些非常独特和外部的存在。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">That our senses offer not their impressions as the images of something <i class="calibre10">distinct</i>, or <i class="calibre10">independent</i>, and <i class="calibre10">external</i>, is evident; because they convey to us nothing but a single perception, and never give us the least intimation of any thing beyond. A single perception can never produce the idea of a double existence, but by some inference either of the reason or imagination. When the mind looks farther than what immediately appears to it, its conclusions can never be put to the account of the senses; and it certainly looks farther, when from a single perception it infers a double existence, and supposes the relations of resemblance and causation betwixt them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们的感官提供的印象并不是<i class="calibre10">独特的</i>、<i class="calibre10">独立的</i>和<i class="calibre10">外部的</i>东西的形象，这是显而易见的；因为它们传达给我们的只是单一的感知，而从未给我们任何超越的东西的暗示。只有通过理性或想象力的某种推论，单一的感知才能产生双重存在的想法。当心灵看得比它立即出现的东西更远时，它的结论永远不能归结于感官；当它从单一感知中推断出双重存在，并假设它们之间的相似性和因果关系时，它当然看得更远。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If our senses, therefore, suggest any idea of distinct existences, they must convey the impressions as those very existences, by a kind of fallacy and illusion. Upon this head we may observe, that all sensations are felt by the mind, such as they really are, and that when we doubt, whether they present themselves as distinct objects, or as mere impressions, the difficulty is not concerning their nature, but concerning their relations and situation. Now if the senses presented our impressions as external to, and independent of ourselves, both the objects and ourselves must be obvious to our senses, otherwise they cou'd not be compar'd by these faculties. The difficulty, then, is how far we are ourselves the objects of our senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，如果我们的感官提出任何关于独特存在的想法，它们就必须通过一种谬误和幻觉，将印象传达为这些存在。在这个问题上，我们可以观察到，所有的感觉都是由心灵感受到的，就像它们真实存在的那样，而当我们怀疑它们是作为独特的对象呈现出来，还是作为单纯的印象呈现出来时，困难不在于它们的性质，而在于它们的关系和情况。现在，如果感官将我们的印象呈现为外部的、独立于我们自己的，那么，对于我们的感官来说，对象和我们自己都必须是显而易见的，否则它们就不能被这些能力所比较。那么，困难在于我们自己在多大程度上是我们感官的对象。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis certain there is no question in philosophy more abstruse than that concerning identity, and the nature of the uniting principle, which constitutes a person. So far from being able by our senses merely to determine this question, we must have recourse to the most profound metaphysics to give a satisfactory answer to it; and in common life 'tis evident these ideas of self and person are never very fix'd nor determinate. 'Tis absurd, therefore, to imagine the senses can ever distinguish betwixt ourselves and external objects.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">可以肯定的是，在哲学中，没有什么问题比关于身份和构成人的联合原则的性质的问题更深奥了。我们的感官远不能确定这个问题，我们必须求助于最深刻的形而上学，才能给出一个令人满意的答案；而在普通生活中，很明显，这些关于自我和人的想法从来都是固定的，也不是确定的。因此，想象感官能够区分我们和外部物体是很荒谬的。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Add to this, that every impression, external and internal, passions, affections, sensations, pains and pleasures, are originally on the same footing; and that whatever other differences we may observe among them, they appear, all of them, in their true colours, as impressions or perceptions. And indeed, if we consider the matter aright, 'tis scarce possible it shou'd be otherwise, nor is it conceivable that our senses shou'd be more capable of deceiving us in the situation and relations, than in the nature of our impressions. For since all actions and sensations of the mind are known to us by consciousness, they must necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they appear. Every thing that enters the mind, being in <i class="calibre10">reality</i> as the perception, 'tis impossible any thing shou'd to <i class="calibre10">feeling</i> appear different.

		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，每一种印象，外部的和内部的，激情、情感、感觉、痛苦和快乐，最初都是在同一基础上的；无论我们在它们之间观察到什么样的差异，它们都以它们的真实面目出现，作为印象或感知。事实上，如果我们正确地考虑这个问题，几乎不可能出现其他情况，也不可能想象我们的感官在情况和关系上比在我们印象的性质上更能欺骗我们。因为既然心灵的所有行动和感觉都被我们的意识所了解，那么它们必然在每一个细节上表现为它们是什么，并且是它们所表现的。每件进入心灵的东西，在<i class="calibre10">现实</i>中都与感知一样，不可能有任何东西在<i class="calibre10">感觉</i>上出现不同。这是在假设，即使在我们最密切的意识中，我们也可能被误解。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the question concerning <i class="calibre10">external</i> existence, it may perhaps be said, that setting aside the metaphysical question of the identity of a thinking substance, our own body evidently belongs to us; and as several impressions appear exterior to the body, we suppose them also exterior to ourselves. The paper, on which I write at present, is beyond my hand. The table is beyond the paper. The walls of the chamber beyond the table. And in casting my eye towards the window, I perceive a great extent of fields and buildings beyond my chamber. From all this it may be infer'd, that no other faculty is requir'd, beside the senses, to convince us of the external existence of body. But to prevent this inference, we need only weigh the three following considerations. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, That, properly speaking, 'tis not our body we perceive, when we regard our limbs and members, but certain impressions, which enter by the senses; so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these impressions, or to their objects, is an act of the mind as difficult to explain, as that which we examine at present. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, Sounds, and tastes, and smells, tho' commonly regarded by the mind as continu'd independent qualities, appear not to have any existence in extension, and consequently cannot appear to the senses as situated externally to the body. The reason, why we ascribe a place to them, shall be consider'd <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-233" id="calibre_link-447" title="29">29</a></sup>afterwards. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, Even our sight informs us not of distance or outness (so to speak) immediately and without a certain reasoning and experience, as is acknowledge'd by the most rational philosophers.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从有关<i class="calibre10">外部</i>存在的问题开始，也许可以说，抛开思维物质的身份这一形而上学问题，我们自己的身体显然属于我们；由于一些印象出现在身体外部，我们认为它们也在我们外部。我现在写的这张纸，在我的手之外。桌子是在纸的外面。桌子之外是房间的墙壁。当我把目光投向窗户时，我看到我的房间外有大片的田野和建筑。从这一切可以推断出，除了感官之外，不需要其他能力来说服我们相信身体的外部存在。但为了防止这种推论，我们只需要权衡以下三个方面的考虑。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，正确地说，当我们看到我们的四肢和肢体时，我们感知的不是我们的身体，而是通过感官进入的某些印象；因此，将真实和肉体的存在赋予这些印象或其对象，是一种心灵的行为，就像我们现在所研究的那样，难以解释。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，声音、味道和气味，虽然通常被头脑视为持续的独立品质，但似乎没有任何延伸的存在，因此不能在感官上显示为位于身体外部。我们为什么要给它们一个位置，原因将在后面考虑。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-233" id="calibre_link-447" title="29">29</a></sup>之后再考虑。<i class="calibre10">第三</i>，即使是我们的视觉，也不会立即告知我们距离或外在（可以说是），也不需要一定的推理和经验，正如最理性的哲学家们所承认的那样。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As to the <i class="calibre10">independency</i> of our perceptions on ourselves, this can never be an object of the senses; but any opinion we form concerning it, must be deriv'd from experience and observation: And we shall see afterwards, that our conclusions from experience are far from being favourable to the doctrine of the independency of our perceptions. Mean while we may observe that when we talk of real distinct existences, we have commonly more in our eye their in dependency than external situation in place, and think an object has a sufficient reality, when its Being is uninterrupted, and independent of the incessant revolutions, which we are conscious of in ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">至于我们的知觉对我们自己的<i class="calibre10">独立性</i>，这永远不可能是感官的对象；但我们对它形成的任何意见，必须从经验和观察中得出。之后我们会看到，我们从经验中得出的结论远远不利于我们的知觉独立的学说。同时我们可以注意到，当我们谈论真正的独特存在时，我们通常更看重它们的依存性，而不是外部情况的位置，并且认为当一个物体的存在是不间断的，并且独立于我们自己意识到的不断旋转时，它就具有充分的真实性。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus to resume what I have said concerning the senses; they give us no notion of continu'd existence, because they cannot operate beyond the extent, in which they really operate. They as little produce the opinion of a distinct existence, because they neither can offer it to the mind as represented, nor as original. To offer it as represented, they must present both an object and an image. To make it appear as original, they must convey a falshood; and this falshood must lie in the relations and situation: In order to which they must be able to compare the object with ourselves; and even in that case they do not, nor is it possible they shou'd, deceive us. We may, therefore, conclude with certainty, that the opinion of a continu'd and of a distinct existence never arises from the senses.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，为了恢复我关于感官的说法；它们没有给我们提供持续存在的概念，因为它们不能在它们真正运作的范围之外运作。它们也很少产生独特存在的观点，因为它们既不能向心灵提供它的表象，也不能提供它的原始。为了把它作为代表提供给人们，它们必须同时提出一个对象和一个形象。为了使它作为原物出现，它们必须传达一种虚假性；而这种虚假性必须在于关系和情况。为了达到这个目的，他们必须能够将对象与我们自己进行比较；即使在这种情况下，他们也不会、也不可能欺骗我们。因此，我们可以肯定地得出结论，关于持续存在和独特存在的观点从未从感官中产生。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this we may observe, that there are three different kinds of impressions convey'd by the senses. The first are those of the figure, bulk, motion and solidity of bodies. The second those of colours, tastes, smells, sounds, heat and cold. The third are the pains and pleasures, that arise from the application of objects to our bodies, as by the cutting of our flesh with steel, and such like. Both philosophers and the vulgar suppose the first of these to have a distinct continu'd existence. The vulgar only regard the second as on the same footing. Both philosophers and the vulgar, again, esteem the third to be merely perceptions; and consequently interrupted and dependent beings.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证实这一点，我们可以观察到，感官所传达的印象有三种不同的类型。第一种是关于物体的形状、体积、运动和坚固性的印象。第二种是颜色、味道、气味、声音、热和冷。第三种是痛苦和快乐，这些痛苦和快乐是由物体作用于我们的身体而产生的，如用钢铁切割我们的肉体，以及诸如此类。哲学家和普通人都认为其中的第一种有一个独特的持续存在。俗人只认为第二种情况与之相同。哲学家和庸人都认为第三种仅仅是感知；因此是中断的和依赖性的存在。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now 'tis evident, that, whatever may be our philosophical opinion, colours, sounds, heat and cold, as far as appears to the senses, exist after the same manner with motion and solidity, and that the difference we make betwixt them in this respect, arises not from the mere perception. So strong is the prejudice for the distinct continu'd existence of the former qualities, that when the contrary opinion is advanc'd by modern philosophers, people imagine they can almost refute it from their feeling and experience, and that their very senses contradict this philosophy. 'Tis also evident, that colours, sounds, &amp;c. are originally on the same footing with the pain that arises from steel, and pleasure that proceeds from a fire; and that the difference betwixt them is founded neither on perception nor reason, but on the imagination. For as they are confest to be, both of them, nothing but perceptions arising from the particular configurations and motions of the parts of body, wherein possibly can their difference consist? Upon the whole, then, we may conclude, that as far as the senses are judges, all perceptions are the same in the manner of their existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在很明显，无论我们的哲学观点如何，颜色、声音、热和冷，就感官而言，与运动和实体是以同样的方式存在的，我们在这方面对它们的区别，并不是来自单纯的感知。人们对前一种品质的持续存在有如此强烈的偏见，以至于当现代哲学家提出相反的观点时，人们认为他们几乎可以从他们的感觉和经验中反驳它，而且他们的感官与这种哲学相矛盾。同样明显的是，颜色、声音等与钢铁产生的疼痛和火产生的快感原本是一样的；它们之间的区别既不是建立在知觉或理性上，而是建立在想象上。因为既然它们都被认为是，只不过是由身体各部分的特殊构造和运动所产生的知觉，那么它们之间的差异可能会在哪里？因此，总的来说，我们可以得出结论，就感官而言，所有的感知在其存在方式上都是一样的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may also observe in this instance of sounds and colours, that we can attribute a distinct continu'd existence to objects without ever consulting Reason, or weighing our opinions by any philosophical principles. And indeed, whatever convincing arguments philosophers may fancy they can produce to establish the belief of objects independent of the mind, 'tis obvious these arguments are known but to very few, and that 'tis not by them, that children, peasants, and the greatest part of mankind are induc'd to attribute objects to some impressions, and deny them to others. Accordingly we find, that all the conclusions, which the vulgar form on this head, are directly contrary to those, which are confirm'd by philosophy. For philosophy informs us, that every thing, which appears to the mind, is nothing but a perception, and is interrupted, and dependent on the mind; whereas the vulgar confound perceptions and objects, and attribute a distinct continu'd existence to the very things they feel or see. This sentiment, then, as it is entirely unreasonable, must proceed from some other faculty than the understanding. To which we may add, that as long as we take our perceptions and objects to be the same, we can never infer the existence of the one from that of the other, nor form any argument from the relation of cause and effect; which is the only one that can assure us of matter of fact. Even after we distinguish our perceptions from our objects, 'twill appear presently, that we are still incapable of reasoning from the existence of one to that of the other: So that upon the whole our reason neither does, nor is it possible it ever shou'd, upon any supposition, give us an assurance of the continu'd and distinct existence of body. That opinion must be entirely owing to the imagination which must now be the subject of our enquiry.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在声音和颜色的例子中，我们也可以看到，我们可以把一个独特的持续存在归于物体，而不需要咨询理性，或用任何哲学原则来衡量我们的意见。事实上，无论哲学家们认为他们能提出什么令人信服的论据来确立独立于心灵的物体的信念，很明显，这些论据只有极少数人知道，而且儿童、农民和人类中的大多数人并不是靠它们来诱导将物体归于某些印象，而否认它们的。因此，我们发现，俗人在这个问题上形成的所有结论，都与哲学所确认的结论直接相反。因为哲学告诉我们，每一件出现在头脑中的事物，都不过是一种感知，而且是中断的，并依赖于头脑；而庸俗的人则把感知和物体混为一谈，并把一种独特的持续存在归于他们所感觉到或看到的事物。那么，这种情绪，由于它是完全不合理的，必须来自理解力以外的其他能力。对此，我们可以补充说，只要我们认为我们的感知和对象是相同的，我们就永远不能从另一个推断出一个的存在，也不能从因果关系中形成任何论据；这是唯一能向我们保证事实的因素。即使在我们把我们的感知与我们的对象区分开来之后，我们仍然无法从一个的存在推论到另一个的存在。因此，总的来说，我们的理性既不会，也不可能，在任何假设下，给我们一个身体持续和独特存在的保证。这种观点必须完全归功于想象力，而想象力必须是我们现在询问的主题。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since all impressions are internal and perishing existences, and appear as such, the notion of their distinct and continu'd existence must arise from a concurrence of some of their qualities with the qualities of the imagination; and since this notion does not extend to all of them, it must arise from certain qualities peculiar to some impressions. 'Twill therefore be easy for us to discover these qualities by a comparison of the impressions, to which we attribute a distinct and continu'd existence, with those, which we regard as internal and perishing.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然所有的印象都是内在的和消亡的存在，并以这种方式出现，那么它们独特和持续存在的概念必须来自于它们的某些品质与想象力的品质的一致；由于这种概念并不延伸到所有的印象，它必须来自于某些印象所特有的某些品质。因此，我们很容易通过比较我们认为具有独特和持续存在的印象与那些我们认为是内部和灭亡的印象来发现这些品质。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may observe, then, that 'tis neither upon account of the involuntariness of certain impressions, as is commonly suppos'd, nor of their superior force and violence, that we attribute to them a reality, and continu'd existence, which we refuse to others, that are voluntary or feeble. For 'tis evident our pains and pleasures, our passions and affections, which we never suppose to have any existence beyond our perception, operate with greater violence, and are equally involuntary, as the impressions of figure and extension, colour and sound, which we suppose to be permanent beings. The heat of a fire, when moderate, is suppos'd to exist in the fire; but the pain, which it causes upon a near approach, is not taken to have any being except in the perception.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">After a little examination, we shall find, that all those objects, to which we attribute a continu'd existence, have a peculiar <i class="calibre10">constancy</i>, which distinguishes them from the impressions, whose existence depends upon our perception. Those mountains, and houses, and trees, which lie at present under my eye, have always appear'd to me in the same order; and when I lose sight of them by shutting my eyes or turning my head, I soon after find them return upon me without the least alteration. My bed and table, my books and papers, present themselves in the same uniform manner, and change not upon account of any interruption in my seeing or perceiving them. This is the case with all the impressions, whose objects are suppos'd to have an external existence; and is the case with no other impressions, whether gentle or violent, voluntary or involuntary.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">稍加研究，我们就会发现，所有那些我们认为持续存在的物体，都有一种特殊的<i class="calibre10">不变性</i>，这使它们与印象不同，后者的存在取决于我们的感知。目前在我眼皮底下的那些山峰、房屋和树木，总是以同样的顺序出现在我面前；当我因闭上眼睛或转过头去而看不到它们时，我很快就发现它们又出现在我面前，没有丝毫改变。我的床和桌子，我的书和文件，都以同样的方式出现，不会因为我看到或感知到它们的任何中断而改变。所有的印象都是这样，它们的对象被认为是有外部存在的；其他的印象也是如此，无论是温和的还是暴力的，自愿的还是不自愿的。</p></div>

When I return to my chamber after an hour's absence, I find not my fire in the same situation, in which I left it: But then I am accustom'd in other instances to see a like alteration produc'd in a like time, whether I am present or absent, near or remote.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Having found that the opinion of the continu'd existence of body depends on the coherence and constancy of certain impressions, I now proceed to examine after what manner these qualities give rise to so extraordinary an opinion. To begin with the coherence; we may observe, that tho' those internal impressions, which we regard as fleeting and perishing, have also a certain coherence or regularity in their appearances, yet 'tis of somewhat a different nature, from that which we discover in bodies. Our passions are found by experience to have a mutual connexion with and dependence on each other; but on no occasion is it necessary to suppose, that they have existed and operated, when they were not perceiv'd, in order to preserve the same dependence and connexion, of which we have had experience. The case is not the same with relation to external objects. Those require a continu'd existence, or otherwise lose, in a great measure, the regularity of their operation. I am here seated in my chamber with my face to the fire; and all the objects, that strike my senses, are contain'd in a few yards around me. My memory, indeed, informs me of the existence of many objects; but then this information extends not beyond their past existence, nor do either my senses or memory give any testimony to the continuance of their being. When therefore I am thus seated, and revolve over these thoughts, I hear on a sudden a noise as of a door turning upon its hinges; and a little after see a porter, who advances towards me. This gives occasion to many new reflections and reasonings. First, I never have observ'd, that this noise cou'd proceed from any thing but the motion of a door; and therefore conclude, that the present phænomenon is a contradiction to all past experience, unless the door, which I remember on t'other side the chamber, be still in being. Again, I have always found, that a human body was possest of a quality, which I call gravity, and which hinders it from mounting in the air, as this porter must have done to arrive at my chamber, unless the stairs I remember be not annihilated by my absence. But this is not all. I receive a letter, which upon opening it I perceive by the hand-writing and subscription to have come from a friend, who says he is two hundred leagues distant. 'Tis evident I can never account for this phænomenon, conformable to my experience in other instances, without spreading out in my mind the whole sea and continent between us, and supposing the effects and continu'd existence of posts and ferries, according to my memory and observation. To consider these phænomena of the porter and letter in a certain light, they are contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded as objections to those maxims, which we form concerning the connexions of causes and effects. I am accustom'd to hear such a sound, and see such an object in motion at the same time. I have not receiv'd in this particular instance both these perceptions. These observations are contrary, unless I suppose that the door still remains, and that it was open'd without my perceiving it: And this supposition, which was at first entirely arbitrary and hypothetical, acquires a force and evidence by its being the only one, upon which I can reconcile these contradictions. There is scarce a moment of my life, wherein there is not a similar instance presented to me, and I have not occasion to suppose the continu'd existence of objects, in order to connect their past and present appearances, and give them such an union with each other, as I have found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and circumstances. Here then I am naturally led to regard the world, as something real and durable, and as preserving its existence, even when it is no longer present to my perception.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在发现身体持续存在的观点取决于某些印象的连贯性和恒定性之后，我现在开始研究这些品质是如何引起这种特殊观点的。首先是连贯性；我们可以注意到，尽管那些被我们视为短暂和消亡的内部印象，在其外观上也有一定的连贯性或规律性，但其性质与我们在身体中发现的不同。我们的经验发现，我们的激情是相互联系和相互依赖的；但在任何情况下，都没有必要假设它们在没有被察觉的时候就已经存在和运作了，以便保持我们所经历的同样的依赖和联系。与外部物体有关的情况就不一样了。这些物体需要持续存在，否则就会在很大程度上失去其运作的规律性。我现在坐在我的房间里，面朝火堆；所有触动我感官的物体都在我周围几码的范围内。我的记忆的确告诉我许多物体的存在；但这种信息并没有超越它们过去的存在，我的感官和记忆也没有为它们的存在提供任何证明。因此，当我这样坐着，对这些想法进行思考时，我突然听到一种声音，就像门在铰链上转动一样；过了一会儿，我看到一个门房，他向我走来。这让我有了许多新的思考和推理。首先，我从来没有注意到，这种声音除了来自门的运动外，还可能来自其他任何东西；因此我得出结论，现在的现象与过去的所有经验都是矛盾的，除非我记得在房间另一边的门仍然存在。另外，我一直发现，人的身体有一种特性，我称之为重力，这种特性阻碍了它在空中飞行，就像这个搬运工到达我的房间时必须做的那样，除非我记得的楼梯没有因为我的离开而消失掉。但这还不是全部。我收到了一封信，打开后我发现这封信是一个朋友写来的，他说他在 200 里格以外的地方。显然，如果我不在脑海中展开我们之间的整个海洋和大陆，并根据我的记忆和观察，假设哨所和渡口的影响和持续存在，我就无法解释这种现象，这与我在其他情况下的经验是一致的。从某种角度来看，搬运工和信件的这些现象是与普通经验相矛盾的，可被视为对那些关于因果关系的格言的反对意见。我习惯于听到这样的声音，同时看到这样的物体在运动。在这个特殊的例子中，我没有收到这两种感知。这些观察是相反的，除非我假设那扇门仍然存在，而且它在我没有察觉的情况下被打开了。而这个起初完全是武断和假设的假设，由于是唯一的假设而获得了力量和证据，据此我可以调和这些矛盾。在我的生活中，几乎没有一刻没有类似的例子出现在我面前，我也没有机会假设物体的持续存在，以便将它们的过去和现在的表象联系起来，并使它们相互结合，因为我通过经验发现它们的特殊性质和情况是适合的。这样，我就自然而然地把世界看作是真实而持久的东西，而且即使它不再出现在我的感知中，也会保持其存在。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this conclusion from the coherence of appearances may seem to be of the same nature with our reasonings concerning causes and effects; as being deriv'd from custom, and regulated by past experience; we shall find upon examination, that they are at the bottom considerably different from each other, and that this inference arises from the understanding, and from custom in an indirect and oblique manner. For 'twill readily be allow'd, that since nothing is ever really present to the mind, besides its own perceptions, 'tis not only impossible, that any habit shou'd ever be acquir'd otherwise than by the regular succession of these perceptions, but also that any habit shou'd ever exceed that degree of regularity. Any degree, therefore, of regularity in our perceptions, can never be a foundation for us to infer a greater degree of regularity in some objects, which are not perceiv'd; since this supposes a contradiction, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> a habit acquir'd by what was never present to the mind. But 'tis evident, that whenever we infer the continu'd existence of the objects of sense from their coherence, and the frequency of their union, 'tis in order to bestow on the objects a greater regularity than what is observ'd in our mere perceptions. We remark a connexion betwixt two kinds of objects in their past appearance to the senses, but are not able to observe this connexion to be perfectly constant, since the turning about of our head, or the shutting of our eyes is able to break it. What then do we suppose in this case, but that these objects still continue their usual connexion, notwithstanding their apparent interruption, and that the irregular appearances are join'd by something, of which we are insensible? But as all reasoning concerning matters of fact arises only from custom, and custom can only be the effect of repeated perceptions, the extending of custom and reasoning beyond the perceptions can never be the direct and natural effect of the constant repetition and connexion, but must arise from the co-operation of some other principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管从表象的一致性得出的这一结论似乎与我们关于因果关系的推理具有相同的性质；因为它来自于习惯，并受过去经验的制约；我们在研究后会发现，它们在本质上有很大的不同，而且这种推理是以间接和斜向的方式从理解和习惯中产生的。因为我们很容易就会发现，既然除了自己的感知之外，没有任何东西真正存在于心灵之中，那么，任何习惯的养成都不可能不是通过这些感知的有规律的连续进行，而且任何习惯都不可能超过这种有规律的程度。因此，我们感知中任何程度的规律性，都不能成为我们推断某些未被感知的物体具有更大程度的规律性的基础；因为这假定了一个矛盾，<i class="calibre10">即</i>一个习惯是由头脑中从未出现过的东西获得的。但显而易见的是，每当我们从感官对象的一致性和它们结合的频率来推断它们的持续存在时，都是为了赋予这些对象比我们单纯的知觉中所观察到的更大的规律。我们注意到两种物体在过去出现在感官上时有一种联系，但不能观察到这种联系是完全恒定的，因为我们的头的转动或眼睛的闭合能够打破这种联系。那么，在这种情况下，我们该如何假设，这些物体仍然保持着它们通常的联系，尽管它们表面上被打断了，而这些不规则的表象是由某种东西连接起来的，而我们对这些东西一无所知？但是，由于所有关于事实问题的推理都只产生于习惯，而习惯只能是反复感知的结果，因此，习惯和推理的延伸超越了感知，永远不可能是不断重复和联系的直接和自然的效果，而必须产生于一些其他原则的合作。</p></div>

This I have assign'd for the reason, why, after considering several loose standards of equality, and correcting them by each other, we proceed to imagine so correct and exact a standard of that relation, as is not liable to the least error or variation. The same principle makes us easily entertain this opinion of the continu'd existence of body. Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our senses; but this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if we suppose the objects to have a continu'd existence; and as the mind is once in the train of observing an uniformity among objects, it naturally continues, till it renders the uniformity as compleat as possible.

		<p class="block_6 en">To remove this difficulty, let us have recourse to the idea of time or duration. I have already observ'd<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-235" id="calibre_link-248" title="31">31</a></sup>, that time, in a strict sense, implies succession, and that when we apply its idea to any unchangeable object, 'tis only by a fiction of the imagination, by which the unchangeable object is suppos'd to participate of the changes of the co-existent objects, and in particular of that of our perceptions. This fiction of the imagination almost universally takes place; and 'tis by means of it, that a single object, plac'd before us, and survey'd for any time without our discovering in it any interruption or variation, is able to give us a notion of identity. For when we consider any two points of this time, we may place them in different lights: We may either survey them at the very same instant; in which case they give us the idea of number, both by themselves and by the object; which must be multiply'd, in order to be conceiv'd at once, as existent in these two different points of time: Or on the other hand, we may trace the succession of time by alike succession of ideas, and conceiving first one moment, along with the object then existent, imagine afterwards a change in the time without any <i class="calibre10">variation</i> or <i class="calibre10">interruption</i> in the object; in which case it gives us the idea of unity. Here then is an idea, which is a medium betwixt unity and number; or more properly speaking, is either of them, according to the view, in which we take it: And this idea we call that of identity. We cannot, in any propriety of speech, say, that an object is the same with itself, unless we mean, that the object existent at one time is the same with itself existent at another. By this means we make a difference, betwixt the idea meant by the word, <i class="calibre10">object</i>, and that meant by <i class="calibre10">itself</i>, without going the length of number, and at the same time without restraining ourselves to a strict and absolute unity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了消除这一困难，让我们求助于时间或期限的概念。我已经说过<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-235" id="calibre_link-248" title="31">31</a></sup>当我们把时间的概念应用于任何不可改变的物体时，只是通过想象力的虚构，把不可改变的物体假设为参与了共同存在的物体的变化，特别是参与了我们的感知的变化。这种想象力的虚构几乎是普遍存在的；正是通过这种虚构，一个单一的物体，摆在我们面前，并且在我们没有发现它的任何中断或变化的情况下进行任何时间的观察，就能够给我们一个相同的概念。因为当我们考虑这个时间的任何两点时，我们可以把它们放在不同的光线下。我们可以在同一时刻对它们进行观察；在这种情况下，它们给我们提供了数字的概念，既包括它们本身，也包括对象；它们必须是乘法的，以便一下子就被设想为存在于这两个不同的时间点上。或者在另一方面，我们可以通过同样的观念继承来追踪时间的继承，首先设想一个时刻，连同当时存在的对象，然后想象时间的变化，而对象没有任何<i class="calibre10">变化</i>或<i class="calibre10">中断</i>；在这种情况下，它给了我们统一性的观念。因此，这里有一个概念，它是统一性和数量之间的媒介；或者更恰当地说，根据我们的观点，它是它们中的任何一个。这个概念我们称之为同一性的概念。我们不能以任何恰当的语言说，一个物体与它本身是相同的，除非我们的意思是，在一个时间存在的物体与另一个时间存在的物体是相同的。通过这种方式，我们在 “<i class="calibre10">对象</i>” 这个词所代表的概念和它<i class="calibre10">本身</i>所代表的概念之间做出了区别，而不至于像数字那样冗长，同时也不至于把自己限制在一个严格和绝对的统一体中。</p></div>

That I may avoid all ambiguity and confusion on this head, I shall observe, that I here account for the opinions and belief of the vulgar with regard to the existence of body; and therefore must entirely conform myself to their manner of thinking and of expressing themselves. Now we have already observ'd, that however philosophers may distinguish betwixt the objects and perceptions of the senses; which they suppose co-existent and resembling; yet this is a distinction, which is not comprehended by the generality of mankind, who as they perceive only one being, can never assent to the opinion of a double existence and representation. Those very sensations, which enter by the eye or ear, are with them the true objects, nor can they readily conceive that this pen or paper, which is immediately perceiv'd, represents another, which is different from, but resembling it. In order, therefore, to accommodate myself to their notions, I shall at first suppose; that there is only a single existence, which I shall call indifferently <i class="calibre10">object</i> or <i class="calibre10">perception</i>, according as it shall seem best to suit my purpose, understanding by both of them what any common man means by a hat, or shoe, or stone, or any other impression, convey'd to him by his senses.

		<p class="block_6 en">To enter, therefore, upon the question concerning the source of the error and deception with regard to identity, when we attribute it to our resembling perceptions, notwithstanding their interruption; I must here recal an observation, which I have already prov'd and explain'd<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-236" id="calibre_link-309" title="32">32</a></sup>. Nothing is more apt to make us mistake one idea for another, than any relation betwixt them, which associates them together in the imagination, and makes it pass with facility from one to the other. Of all relations, that of resemblance is in this respect the most efficacious; and that because it not only causes an association of ideas, but also of dispositions, and makes us conceive the one idea by an act or operation of the mind, similar to that by which we conceive the other. This circumstance I have observ'd to be of great moment; and we may establish it for a general rule, that whatever ideas place the mind in the same disposition or in similar ones, are very apt to be confounded. The mind readily passes from one to the other, and perceives not the change without a strict attention, of which, generally speaking, 'tis wholly incapable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to apply this general maxim, we must first examine the disposition of the mind in viewing any object which preserves a perfect identity, and then find some other object, that is confounded with it, by causing a similar disposition. When we fix our thought on any object, and suppose it to continue the same for some time; 'tis evident we suppose the change to lie only in the time, and never exert ourselves to produce any new image or idea of the object. The faculties of the mind repose themselves in a manner, and take no more exercise, than what is necessary to continue that idea, of which we were formerly possest, and which subsists without variation or interruption. The passage from one moment to another is scarce felt, and distinguishes not itself by a different perception or idea, which may require a different direction of the spirits, in order to its conception.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now what other objects, beside identical ones, are capable of placing the mind in the same disposition, when it considers them, and of causing the same uninterrupted passage of the imagination from one idea to another? This question is of the last importance. For if we can find any such objects, we may certainly conclude, from the foregoing principle, that they are very naturally confounded with identical ones, and are taken for them in most of our reasonings. But tho' this question be very important, 'tis not very difficult nor doubtful. For I immediately reply, that a succession of related objects places the mind in this disposition, and is consider'd with the same smooth and uninterrupted progress of the imagination, as attends the view of the same invariable object. The very nature and essence of relation is to connect our ideas with each other, and upon the appearance of one, to facilitate the transition to its correlative. The passage betwixt related ideas is, therefore, so smooth and easy, that it produces little alteration on the mind, and seems like the continuation of the same action; and as the continuation of the same action is an effect of the continu'd view of the same object, 'tis for this reason we attribute sameness to every succession of related objects. The thought slides along the succession with equal facility, as if it consider'd only one object; and therefore confounds the succession with the identity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，除了相同的对象之外，还有什么其他的对象能够使人在考虑这些对象时处于同样的状态，并使想象力同样不间断地从一个想法到另一个想法？这个问题是最重要的。因为如果我们能找到任何这样的对象，我们当然可以从前面的原则中得出结论，它们非常自然地与相同的对象相混淆，并在我们大多数的推理中被当作它们。但是，尽管这个问题非常重要，它并不十分困难，也不值得怀疑。因为我立即回答说，一连串有关系的物体使人的思想处于这种状态，并以想象力的同样顺利和不间断的进展来考虑，就像看待同一不变的物体一样。关系的本质是将我们的观念相互联系起来，当一个观念出现时，便于过渡到它的对应物。因此，相关概念之间的传递是如此顺利和容易，以至于它在头脑中产生的变化很小，看起来就像同一行动的延续；由于同一行动的延续是对同一对象的持续看法的结果，因此我们把同一性归于每一个相关对象的连续。思想以同样的方式沿着连续的物体滑动，就像它只考虑一个物体一样；因此把连续和同一混淆了。</p></div>

This resemblance is observ'd in a thousand instances, and naturally connects together our ideas of these interrupted perceptions by the strongest relation, and conveys the mind with an easy transition from one to another.

The very image, which is present to the senses, is with us the real body; and 'tis to these interrupted images we ascribe a perfect identity. But as the interruption of the appearance seems contrary to the identity, and naturally leads us to regard these resembling perceptions as different from each other, we here find ourselves at a loss how to reconcile such opposite opinions. The smooth passage of the imagination along the ideas of the resembling perceptions makes us ascribe to them a perfect identity. The interrupted manner of their appearance makes us consider them as so many resembling, but still distinct beings, which appear after certain intervals.

On the contrary, whatever strikes in with the natural propensities, and either externally forwards their satisfaction, or internally concurs with their movements, is sure to give a sensible pleasure. Now there being here an opposition betwixt the notion of the identity of resembling perceptions, and the interruption of their appearance, the mind must be uneasy in that situation, and will naturally seek relief from the uneasiness. Since the uneasiness arises from the opposition of two contrary principles, it must look for relief by sacrificing the one to the other.

		<p class="block_6 en">We may begin with observing, that the difficulty in the present case is not concerning the matter of fact, or whether the mind forms such a conclusion concerning the continu'd existence of its perceptions, but only concerning the manner in which the conclusion is form'd, and principles from which it is deriv'd. 'Tis certain, that almost all mankind, and even philosophers themselves, for the greatest part of their lives, take their perceptions to be their only objects, and suppose, that the very being, which is intimately present to the mind, is the real body or material existence. 'Tis also certain, that this very perception or object is suppos'd to have a continu'd uninterrupted being, and neither to be annihilated by our absence, nor to be brought into existence by our presence. When we are absent from it, we say it still exists, but that we do not feel, we do not see it. When we are present, we say we feel, or see it. Here then may arise two questions; <i class="calibre10">First</i>, How we can satisfy ourselves in supposing a perception to be absent from the mind without being annihilated. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, After what manner we conceive an object to become present to the mind, without some new creation of a perception or image; and what we mean by this <i class="calibre10">seeing</i>, and <i class="calibre10">feeling</i>, and <i class="calibre10">perceiving</i>. a As to the first question; we may observe, that what we call a mind, is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations, and suppos'd, tho' falsely, to be endow'd with a perfect simplicity and identity. Now as every perception is distinguishable from another, and may be consider'd as separately existent; it evidently follows, that there is no absurdity in separating any particular perception from the mind; that is, in breaking off all its relations, with that connected mass of perceptions, which constitute a thinking being.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以先观察一下，本案例中的困难不在于事实问题，也不在于心灵是否对其感知的持续存在形成这样的结论，而只在于形成结论的方式，以及推导结论的原则。可以肯定的是，几乎所有的人，甚至是哲学家自己，在他们生活的大部分时间里，都把他们的知觉当作他们唯一的对象，并且认为，与心灵密切相关的存在就是真正的身体或物质存在。同样可以肯定的是，这个感知或对象被认为有一个持续的、不间断的存在，既不会因为我们的离开而消失，也不会因为我们的存在而产生。当我们不在它身边时，我们说它仍然存在，但我们没有感觉，我们没有看到它。当我们在场时，我们说我们感觉到，或看到它。那么，这里可能会出现两个问题：<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，我们怎样才能使自己满意，假设一个感知不在头脑中而不被湮灭。<i class="calibre10">至于</i>第一个问题，我们可以<i class="calibre10">看到</i>，我们所谓的心灵，不过是一堆不同的知觉的集合，通过某些关系结合在一起，并被假定为具有完美的简单性和同一性，尽管这是错误的。现在，由于每一种感知都可以与另一种感知区分开来，并且可以被认为是单独存在的；显然，把任何特定的感知从心灵中分离出来并不荒谬；也就是说，把它的所有关系与构成一个有思想的生命的那批感知切断。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The same reasoning affords us an answer to the second question. If the name of <i class="calibre10">perception</i> renders not this separation from a mind absurd and contradictory, the name of <i class="calibre10">object</i>, standing for the very same thing, can never render their conjunction impossible. External objects are seen, and felt, and become present to the mind; that is, they acquire such a relation to a connected heap of perceptions, as to influence them very considerably in augmenting their number by present reflections and passions, and in storing the memory with ideas. The same continu'd and uninterrupted Being may, therefore, be sometimes present to the mind, and sometimes absent from it, without any real or essential change in the Being itself. An interrupted appearance to the senses implies not necessarily an interruption in the existence. The supposition of the continu'd existence of sensible objects or perceptions involves no contradiction. We may easily indulge our inclination to that supposition. When the exact resemblance of our perceptions makes us ascribe to them an identity, we may remove the seeming interruption by feigning a continu'd being, which may fill those intervals, and preserve a perfect and entire identity to our perceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">同样的推理为我们提供了第二个问题的答案。如果<i class="calibre10">感知</i>的名称不会使这种与心灵的分离变得荒谬和矛盾，那么代表同一事物的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>的名称就永远不会使它们的结合变得不可能。外部物体被看到，被感觉到，并成为心灵的存在；也就是说，它们获得了与一堆相连的感知的关系，以至于在通过当前的思考和激情来增加它们的数量，并在记忆中储存观念方面对它们产生了非常大的影响。因此，同一个连续的、不间断的存在，有时会出现在头脑中，有时又不在头脑中，而存在本身没有任何真实的或本质的变化。对感官来说，一个中断的外观不一定意味着存在的中断。假设感性对象或知觉的持续存在，并不涉及矛盾。我们可以轻易地放纵我们对这种假设的倾向。当我们的感知的确切相似性使我们归因于它们的同一性时，我们可以通过假装一个连续的存在来消除看似中断的现象，它可以填补这些间隔，并对我们的感知保持一个完美和完整的同一性。</p></div>

It has been prov'd already, that belief in general consists in nothing, but the vivacity of an idea; and that an idea may acquire this vivacity by its relation to some present impression. Impressions are naturally the most vivid perceptions of the mind; and this quality is in part convey'd by the relation to every connected idea. The relation causes a smooth passage from the impression to the idea, and even gives a propensity to that passage. The mind falls so easily from the one perception to the other, that it scarce perceives the change, but retains in the second a considerable share of the vivacity of the first. It is excited by the lively impression; and this vivacity is convey'd to the related idea, without any great diminution in the passage, by reason of the smooth transition and the propensity of the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But suppose, that this propensity arises from some other principle, besides that of relation; 'tis evident it must still have the same effect, and convey the vivacity from the impression to the idea. Now this is exactly the present case. Our memory presents us with a vast number of instances of perceptions perfectly resembling each other, that return at different distances of time, and after considerable interruptions. This resemblance gives us a propension to consider these interrupted perceptions as the same; and also a propension to connect them by a continu'd existence, in order to justify this identity, and avoid the contradiction, in which the interrupted appearance of these perceptions seems necessarily to involve us. Here then we have a propensity to feign the continu'd existence of all sensible objects; and as this propensity arises from some lively impressions of the memory, it bestows a vivacity on that fiction; or in other words, makes us believe the continu'd existence of body. If sometimes we ascribe a continu'd existence to objects, which are perfectly new to us, and of whose constancy and coherence we have no experience, 'tis because the manner, in which they present themselves to our senses, resembles that of constant and coherent objects; and this resemblance is a source of reasoning and analogy, and leads us to attribute the same qualities to the similar objects.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，假设这种倾向是由关系以外的其他原则产生的；很明显，它仍然必须具有相同的效果，并将活力从印象传达给观念。现在，这正是目前的情况。我们的记忆为我们提供了大量的感知实例，它们彼此完全相似，在不同的时间距离和相当长的中断后返回。这种相似性使我们有一种倾向性，认为这些中断的知觉是相同的；也有一种倾向性，将它们通过持续的存在联系起来，以证明这种同一性，并避免矛盾，因为这些知觉的中断出现似乎必然使我们陷入其中。因此，我们有一种假装所有可感对象持续存在的倾向；由于这种倾向来自于记忆中一些生动的印象，它赋予了这种虚构以活力；或者换句话说，使我们相信身体的持续存在。如果有时我们把对我们来说完全陌生的物体归结为持续存在，而且我们对其恒定性和一致性没有经验，那是因为它们呈现在我们感官中的方式与恒定和一致的物体相似；这种相似性是推理和类比的来源，并导致我们把同样的品质归结为类似的物体。</p></div>

'Tis indeed evident, that as the vulgar <i class="calibre10">suppose</i> their perceptions to be their only objects, and at the same time <i class="calibre10">believe</i> the continu'd existence of matter, we must account for the origin of the belief upon that supposition. Now upon that supposition, 'tis a false opinion that any of our objects, or perceptions, are identically the same after an interruption; and consequently the opinion of their identity can never arise from reason, but must arise from the imagination. The imagination is seduc'd into such an opinion only by means of the resemblance of certain perceptions; since we find they are only our resembling perceptions, which we have a propension to suppose the same. This propension to bestow an identity on our resembling perceptions, produces the fiction of a continu'd existence; since that fiction, as well as the identity, is really false, as is acknowledge'd by all philosophers, and has no other effect than to remedy the interruption of our perceptions, which is the only circumstance that is contrary to their identity. In the last place this propension causes belief by means of the present impressions of the memory; since without the remembrance of former sensations, 'tis plain we never shou'd have any belief of the continu'd existence of body. Thus in examining all these parts, we find that each of them is supported by the strongest proofs; and that all of them together form a consistent system, which is perfectly convincing.

I have already observ'd, that there is an intimate connexion betwixt those two principles, of a <i class="calibre10">continu'd</i> and of a <i class="calibre10">distinct</i> or <i class="calibre10">independent</i> existence, and that we no sooner establish the one than the other follows, as a necessary consequence.

But when we compare experiments, and reason a little upon them, we quickly perceive, that the doctrine of the independent existence of our sensible perceptions is contrary to the plainest experience.

But as we do not attribute a continu'd existence to both these perceptions, and as they are both of the same nature, we clearly perceive, that all our perceptions are dependent on our organs, and the disposition of our nerves and animal spirits. This opinion is confirm'd by the seeming encrease and diminution of objects, according to their distance; by the apparent alterations in their figure; by the changes in their colour and other qualities from our sickness and distempers; and by an infinite number of other experiments of the same kind; from all which we learn, that our sensible perceptions are not possest of any distinct or independent existence.</p>

But however philosophical this new system may be esteem'd, I assert that 'tis only a palliative remedy, and that it contains all the difficulties of the vulgar system, with some others, that are peculiar to itself. There are no principles either of the understanding or fancy, which lead us directly to embrace this opinion of the double existence of perceptions and objects, nor can we arrive at it but by passing thro' the common hypothesis of the identity and continuance of our interrupted perceptions. Were we not first persuaded, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exist even when they no longer make their appearance to the senses, we shou'd never be led to think, that our perceptions and objects are different, and that our objects alone preserve a continu'd existence. 'The latter hypothesis has no primary recommendation either to reason or the imagination, but acquires all its influence on the imagination from the former.'

		<p class="block_6 en">As to the first part of the proposition, <i class="calibre10">that this philosophical hypotheses has no primary recommendation, either to reason or the imagination,</i>, we may soon satisfy ourselves with regard to reason by the following reflections. The only existences, of which we are certain, are perceptions, which being immediately present to us by consciousness, command our strongest assent, and are the first foundation of all our conclusions. The only conclusion we can draw from the existence of one thing to that of another, is by means of the relation of cause and effect, which shews, that there is a connexion betwixt them, and that the existence of one is dependent on that of the other. The idea of this relation is deriv'd from past experience, by which we find, that two beings are constantly conjoin'd together, and are always present at once to the mind. But as no beings are ever present to the mind but perceptions; it follows that we may observe a conjunction or a relation of cause and effect between different perceptions, but can never observe it between perceptions and objects. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that from the existence or any of the qualities of the former, we can ever form any conclusion concerning the existence of the latter, or ever satisfy our reason in this particular.</p>

If any one wou'd take the pains to examine this question, and wou'd invent a system, to account for the direct origin of this opinion from the imagination, we shou'd be able, by the examination of that system, to pronounce a certain judgment in the present subject. Let it be taken for granted, that our perceptions are broken, and interrupted, and however like, are still different from each other; and let any one upon this supposition shew why the fancy, directly and immediately, proceeds to the belief of another existence, resembling these perceptions in their nature, but yet continu'd, and uninterrupted, and identical; and after he has done this to my satisfaction, I promise to renounce my present opinion. Mean while I cannot forbear concluding, from the very abstractedness and difficulty of the first supposition, that 'tis an improper subject for the fancy to work upon.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The imagination naturally runs on in this train of thinking. Our perceptions are our only objects: Resembling perceptions are the same, however broken or uninterrupted in their appearance: This appearing interruption is contrary to the identity: The interruption consequently extends not beyond the appearance, and the perception or object really continues to exist, even when absent from us: Our sensible perceptions have, therefore, a continu'd and uninterrupted existence. But as a little reflection destroys this conclusion, that our perceptions have a continu'd existence, by shewing that they have a dependent one, 'twou'd naturally be expected, that we must altogether reject the opinion, that there is such a. thing in nature as a continu'd existence, which is preserv'd even when it no longer appears to the senses. The case, however, is otherwise. Philosophers are so far from rejecting the opinion of a continu'd existence upon rejecting that of the independence and continuance of our sensible perceptions, that tho' all sects agree in the latter sentiment, the former, which is, in a manner, its necessary consequence, has been peculiar to a few extravagant sceptics; who after all maintain'd that opinion in words only, and were never able to bring themselves sincerely to believe it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">想象力自然而然地在这一思路中运行。我们的知觉是我们唯一的对象。相似的知觉是相同的，无论它们的外观是破碎的还是不间断的。这种表面上的中断是与特性相反的。因此，这种中断并不超越表象，而感知或物体确实继续存在，即使不在我们身边。因此，我们的感性认识有一个持续的和不间断的存在。但是，由于稍加思考就会破坏这个结论，即我们的知觉有一个持续的存在，因为它显示出它们有一个依赖性的存在，所以我们自然会想到，我们必须完全拒绝这种观点，即自然界有这样一种持续的存在，即使它不再出现在感官上也会被保存下来。然而，情况并非如此。哲学家们远远没有在拒绝我们的感性认识的独立性和持续性的观点时拒绝持续存在的观点，尽管所有的教派都同意后一种观点，但前一种观点，也就是它的必然结果，一直是少数奢侈的怀疑论者所特有的；他们毕竟只是在口头上坚持这种观点，而从未能使自己真诚地相信它。</p></div>

If these opinions become contrary, 'tis not difficult to foresee which of them will have the advantage. As long as our attention is bent upon the subject, the philosophical and study'd principle may prevail; but the moment we relax our thoughts, nature will display herself, and draw us back to our former opinion. Nay she has sometimes such an influence, that she can stop our progress, even in the midst of our most profound reflections, and keep us from running on with all the consequences of any philosophical opinion. Thus tho' we clearly perceive the dependence and interruption of our perceptions, we stop short in our career, and never upon that account reject the notion of an independent and continu'd existence.

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' our natural and obvious principles here prevail above our study'd reflections, 'tis certain there must be some struggle and opposition in the case; at least so long as these reflections retain any force or vivacity. In order to set ourselves at ease in this particular, we contrive a new hypothesis, which seems to comprehend both these principles of reason and imagination. This hypothesis is the philosophical one of the double existence of perceptions and objects; which pleases our reason, in allowing, that our dependent perceptions are interrupted and different; and at the same time is agreeable to the imagination, in attributing a continu'd existence to something else, which we call <i class="calibre10">objects</i>. This philosophical system, therefore, is the monstrous offspring of two principles, which are contrary to each other, which are both at once embrac'd by the mind, and which are unable mutually to destroy each other. The imagination tells us, that our resembling perceptions have a continu'd and uninterrupted existence, and are not annihilated by their absence. Reflection tells us, that even our resembling perceptions are interrupted in their existence, and different from each other. The contradiction betwixt these opinions we elude by a new fiction, which is conformable to the hypotheses both of reflection and fancy, by ascribing these contrary qualities to different existences; the <i class="calibre10">interruption</i> to perceptions, and the <i class="calibre10">continuance</i> to objects. Nature is obstinate, and will not quit the field, however strongly attack'd by reason; and at the same time reason is so clear in the point, that there is no possibility of disguising her. Not being able to reconcile these two enemies, we endeavour to set ourselves at ease as much as possible, by successively granting to each whatever it demands, and by feigning a double existence, where each may find something, that has all the conditions it desires. Were we fully convinc'd, that our resembling perceptions are continu'd, and identical, and independent, we shou'd never run into this opinion of a double existence; since we shou'd find satisfaction in our first supposition, and wou'd not look beyond. Again, were we fully convinc'd, that our perceptions are dependent, and interrupted, and different, we shou'd be as little inclin'd to embrace the opinion of a double existence; since in that case we shou'd clearly perceive the error of our first supposition of a continu'd existence, and wou'd never regard it any farther. 'Tis therefore from the intermediate situation of the mind, that this opinion arises, and from such an adherence to these two contrary principles, as makes us seek some pretext to justify our receiving both; which happily at last is found in the system of a double existence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管我们的自然和明显的原则在这里凌驾于我们研究的思考之上，但可以肯定的是，在这种情况下必须有一些斗争和反对；至少只要这些思考还保留着任何力量或活力。为了在这个问题上让自己安心，我们设计了一个新的假设，它似乎同时包含了这些理性和想象力的原则。这个假说是哲学上的，即感知和物体的双重存在；这使我们的理性高兴，因为它允许我们的依赖性感知是中断的和不同的；同时也符合想象力，因为它把一种持续的存在归于其他东西，我们称之为<i class="calibre10">物体</i>。因此，这个哲学体系是两个原则的畸形后代，这两个原则是相互对立的，它们同时被思想所包容，而且它们无法相互摧毁对方。想象力告诉我们，我们相似的知觉有一个持续和不间断的存在，并不会因为它们的消失而消灭。反思告诉我们，即使是我们相似的知觉，在它们的存在中也是中断的，并且彼此不同。这些观点之间的矛盾，我们通过一种新的虚构来回避，这种虚构符合反思和幻想的假设，把这些相反的品质归结为不同的存在；感知的<i class="calibre10">中断</i>和物体的<i class="calibre10">持续</i>存在。自然是顽固的，无论理性如何强烈攻击，它都不会退出这个领域；同时，理性在这一点上又是如此明确，以至于没有可能掩饰她。由于无法调和这两个敌人，我们就努力使自己尽可能地安心，办法是先后给予每一个人它所要求的东西，并假装有一个双重的存在，在那里每一个人都可以找到具有它所希望的所有条件的东西。如果我们完全相信我们相似的知觉是连续的、相同的、独立的，我们就不会遇到这种双重存在的观点；因为我们会在我们的第一个假设中找到满足感，而不会去看别的。同样，如果我们完全相信我们的知觉是依赖的、中断的和不同的，我们就不会倾向于接受双重存在的观点；因为在这种情况下，我们会清楚地认识到我们关于连续存在的第一个假设的错误，并且永远不会再考虑它。因此，这种观点产生于心灵的中间状态，产生于对这两个相反的原则的坚持，使我们寻找某种借口来证明我们接受这两个原则是正确的；令人高兴的是，最后在双重存在的体系中找到了这种借口。</p></div>

That opinion, therefore, is deriv'd from nothing but the quality of the fancy above-explain'd, <i class="calibre10">that it borrows all its ideas from some precedent perception</i>.

		<p class="block_6 cn">在这个系统的其他细节中，我们可以注意到它以一种非常明显的方式对想象力的依赖。在这些方面，我将观察以下两点。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，我们假设外部物体类似于内部感知。我已经证明，因果关系永远不会给我们提供任何公正的结论，从我们的感知的存在或质量到外部连续物体的存在。我还要补充说，即使它们能提供这样的结论，我们也没有任何理由推断出我们的物体与我们的感觉相似。因此，这种观点的产生，只是源于上面所解释的幻想的特性，<i class="calibre10">即它的所有想法都来自于某种先验的感知</i>。除了感知，我们永远无法设想任何东西，因此必须使每件东西都与它们相似。</p></div>

I begun this subject with premising, that we ought to have an implicit faith in our senses, and that this wou'd be the conclusion, I shou'd draw from the whole of my reasoning. But to be ingenuous, I feel myself <i class="calibre10">at present</i> of a quite contrary sentiment, and am more inclin'd to repose no faith at all in my senses; or rather imagination, than to place in it such an implicit confidence. I cannot conceive how such trivial qualities of the fancy, conducted by such false suppositions, can ever lead to any solid and rational system. They are the coherence and constancy of our perceptions, which produce the opinion of their continu'd existence; tho' these qualities of perceptions have no perceivable connexion with such an existence. The constancy of our perceptions has the most considerable effect, and yet is attended with the greatest difficulties. 'Tis a gross illusion to suppose, that our resembling perceptions are numerically the same; and 'tis this illusion, which leads us into the opinion, that these perceptions are uninterrupted, and are still existent, even when they are not present to the senses. This is the case with our popular system. And as to our philosophical one, 'tis liable to the same difficulties; and is over-and-above loaded with this absurdity, that it at once denies and establishes the vulgar supposition. Philosophers deny our resembling perceptions to be identically the same, and uninterrupted; and yet have so great a propensity to believe them such, that they arbitrarily invent a new set of perceptions, to which they attribute these qualities. I say, a new set of perceptions: For we may well suppose in general, but 'tis impossible for us distinctly to conceive, objects to be in their nature any thing but exactly the same with perceptions. What then can we look for from this confusion of groundless and extraordinary opinions but error and falshood? And how can we justify to ourselves any belief we repose in them?</p>

'Tis impossible upon any system to defend either our understanding or senses; and we but expose them farther when we endeavour to justify them in that manner. As the sceptical doubt arises naturally from a profound and intense reflection on those subjects, it always encreases, the farther we carry our reflections, whether in opposition or conformity to it. Carelessness and in-attention alone can afford us any remedy. For this reason I rely entirely upon them; and take it for granted, whatever may be the reader's opinion at this present moment, that an hour hence he will be persuaded there is both an external and internal world; and going upon that supposition, I intend to examine some general systems both ancient and modern, which have been propos'd of both, before I proceed to a more particular enquiry concerning our impressions.

Our character is the same throughout, say they, and appears best where artifice, fear, and policy have no place, and men can neither be hypocrites with themselves nor others. The generosity, or baseness of our temper, our meekness or cruelty, our courage or pusilanimity, influence the fictions of the imagination with the most unbounded liberty, and discover themselves in the most glaring colours. In like manner, I am persuaded, there might be several useful discoveries made from a criticism of the fictions of the antient philosophy, concerning <i class="calibre10">substances, and substantial forms, and accidents, and occult qualities;</i> which, however unreasonable and capricious, have a very intimate connexion with the principles of human nature.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis confest by the most judicious philosophers, that our ideas of bodies are nothing but collections form'd by the mind of the ideas of the several distinct sensible qualities, of which objects are compos'd, and which we find to have a constant union with each other. But however these qualities may in themselves be entirely distinct, 'tis certain we commonly regard the compound, which they form, as One thing, and as continuing the Same under very considerable alterations. The acknowledge'd composition is evidently contrary to this suppos'd <i class="calibre10">simplicity</i>, and the variation to the <i class="calibre10">identity</i>. It may, therefore, be worth while to consider the causes, which make us almost universally fall into such evident contradictions, as well as the <i class="calibre10">means</i> by which we endeavour to conceal them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis evident, that as the ideas of the several distinct <i class="calibre10">successive</i> qualities of objects are united together by a very close relation, the mind, in looking along the succession, must be carry'd from one part of it to another by an easy transition, and will no more perceive the change, than if it contemplated the same unchangeable object. This easy transition is the effect, or rather essence of relation; and as the imagination readily takes one idea for another, where their influence on the mind is similar; hence it proceeds, that any such succession of related qualities is readily consider'd as one continu'd object, existing without any variation. The smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought, being alike in both cases, readily deceives the mind, and makes us ascribe an identity to the changeable succession of connected qualities. But when we alter our method of considering the succession, and instead of tracing it gradually thro' the successive points of time, survey at once any two distinct periods of its duration, and compare the different conditions of the successive qualities; in that case the variations, which were insensible when they arose gradually, do now appear of consequence, and seem entirely to destroy the identity. By this means there arises a kind of contrariety in our method of thinking, from the different points of view, in which we survey the object, and from the nearness or remoteness of those instants of time, which we compare together. When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession; because 'tis by a similar act of the mind we consider an unchangeable object. When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broke; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a <i class="calibre10">substance, or original and first matter</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We entertain a like notion with regard to the <i class="calibre10">simplicity</i> of substances, and from like causes. Suppose an object perfectly simple and indivisible to be presented, along with another object, whose <i class="calibre10">co-existent</i> parts are connected together by a strong relation, 'tis evident the actions of the mind, in considering these two objects, are not very different. The imagination conceives the simple object at once, with facility, by a single effort of thought, without change or variation. The connexion of parts in the compound object has almost the same effect, and so unites the object within itself, that the fancy feels not the transition in passing from one part to another. Hence the colour, taste, figure, solidity, and other qualities, combin'd in a peach or melon, are conceiv'd to form <i class="calibre10">one thing</i>; and that on account of their close relation, which makes them affect the thought in the same manner, as if perfectly uncompounded. But the mind rests not here. Whenever it views the object in another light, it finds that all these qualities are different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other; which view of things being destructive of its primary and more natural notions, obliges the imagination to feign an unknown something, or <i class="calibre10">original</i> substance and matter, as a principle of union or cohesion among these qualities, and as what may give the compound object a title to be call'd one thing, notwithstanding its diversity and composition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对于物质的<i class="calibre10">简单性</i>，我们有一个类似的概念，也是出于类似的原因。假设一个完全简单和不可分割的物体与另一个物体一起出现，而后者的<i class="calibre10">共存</i>部分是通过一种强烈的关系连接在一起的，那么很明显，在考虑这两个物体时，心灵的行动并不十分不同。想象力通过单一的思想努力，立即轻松地构思出简单的物体，没有任何变化或改变。在复合物体中各部分的联系几乎具有相同的效果，并使物体在其内部结合起来，以至于想象力在从一个部分转到另一个部分时感觉不到过渡。因此，桃子或甜瓜的颜色、味道、形状、坚固性和其他品质结合在一起，被认为是<i class="calibre10">一种东西</i>；这是因为它们之间的密切关系，使它们以同样的方式影响思想，就像完全没有结合在一起。但是，思想并没有在这里休息。每当它从另一个角度看这个物体时，就会发现所有这些品质都是不同的，可以区分的，可以相互分离的；这种对事物的看法破坏了它的主要和更自然的概念，迫使想象力假装一个未知的东西，或者<i class="calibre10">原始的</i>物质和材料，作为这些品质之间的联合或凝聚的原则，并作为可能赋予复合物体一个名称的东西，尽管它的多样性和组成。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The peripatetic philosophy asserts the <i class="calibre10">original</i> matter to be perfectly homogeneous in all bodies, and considers fire, water, earth, and air, as of the very same substance; on account of their gradual revolutions and changes into each other. At the same time it assigns to each of these species of objects a distinct <i class="calibre10">substantial form</i>, which it supposes to be the source of all those different qualities they possess, and to be a new foundation of simplicity and identity to each particular species. All depends on our manner of viewing the objects. When we look along the insensible changes of bodies, we suppose all of them to be of the same substance or essence; When we consider their sensible differences, we attribute to each of them a substantial and essential difference.

		<p class="block_6 en">The notion of <i class="calibre10">accidents</i> is an unavoidable consequence of this method of thinking with regard to substances and substantial forms; nor can we forbear looking upon colours, sounds, tastes, figures, and other properties of bodies, as existences, which cannot subsist apart, but require a subject of inhesion to sustain and support them. For having never discover'd any of these sensible qualities, where, for the reasons above-mention'd, we did not likewise fancy a substance to exist; the same habit, which makes us infer a connexion betwixt cause and effect, makes us here infer a dependence of every quality on the unknown substance. The custom of imagining a dependence has the same effect as the custom of observing it wou'd have. This conceit, however, is no more reasonable than any of the foregoing.

		<p class="block_6 en">In considering this subject we may observe a gradation of three opinions, that rise above each other, according as the persons, who form them, acquire new degrees of reason and knowledge. These opinions are that of the vulgar, that of a false philosophy, and that of the true; where we shall find upon enquiry, that the true philosophy approaches nearer to the sentiments of the vulgar, than to those of a mistaken knowledge. 'Tis natural for men, in their common and careless way of thinking, to imagine they perceive a connexion betwixt such objects as they have constantly found united together; and because custom has render'd it difficult to separate the ideas, they are apt to fancy such a separation to be in itself impossible and absurd. But philosophers, who abstract from the effects of custom, and compare the ideas of objects, immediately perceive the falshood of these vulgar sentiments, and discover that there is no known connexion among objects. Every different object appears to them entirely distinct and separate; and they perceive, that 'tis not from a view of the nature and qualities of objects we infer one from another, but only when in several instances we observe them to have been constantly conjoin'd. But these philosophers, instead of drawing a just inference from this observation, and concluding, that we have no idea of power or agency, separate from the mind, and belonging to causes; I say, instead of drawing this conclusion, they frequently search for the qualities, in which this agency consists, and are displeased with every system, which their reason suggests to them, in order to explain it. They have sufficient force of genius to free them from the vulgar error, that there is a natural and perceivable connexion betwixt the several sensible qualities and actions of matter; but not sufficient to keep them from ever seeking for this connexion in matter, or causes. Had they fallen upon the just conclusion, they wou'd have return'd back to the situation of the vulgar, and wou'd have regarded all these disquisitions with indolence and indifference. At present they seem to be in a very lamentable condition, and such as the poets have given us but a faint notion of in their descriptions of the punishment of <i class="calibre10">Sisyphus</i> and <i class="calibre10">Tantalus</i>. For what can be imagin'd more tormenting, than to seek with eagerness, what for ever flies us; and seek for it in a place, where 'tis impossible it can ever exist?</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在考虑这个问题时，我们可以观察到三种观点的梯度，它们随着形成这些观点的人获得新的理性和知识程度而相互上升。这些观点是：庸俗的观点、错误的哲学观点和真正的观点；在这里我们会发现，真正的哲学比错误的知识更接近于庸俗的情感。人在普通和粗心的思考方式中，很自然地想象他们在经常发现结合在一起的物体之间发现了一种联系；由于习惯使人很难将这些想法分开，他们很容易认为这种分离本身是不可能和荒谬的。但是，哲学家们从习俗的影响中抽离出来，对物体的观念进行比较，就会立即察觉到这些庸俗情绪的虚假性，并发现物体之间没有已知的联系。在他们看来，每一个不同的物体都是完全不同的、独立的；他们还意识到，我们不是从物体的性质和质量的角度来推断一个物体，而是只有在我们观察到它们经常结合在一起的几个例子中才会这样做。但是，这些哲学家并没有从这种观察中得出公正的推论，并得出结论说，我们没有脱离心灵的、属于原因的力量或机构的概念；我说，他们并没有得出这个结论，而是经常寻找这种机构所包含的品质，并对他们的理性向他们建议的每一个系统感到不满意，以便解释它。他们有足够的天才力量把他们从庸俗的错误中解脱出来，即在物质的几种可感知的品质和行动之间存在着一种自然和可感知的联系；但还不足以使他们永远不在物质或原因中寻找这种联系。如果他们得出了正确的结论，他们就会回到庸人的境地，就会以懒惰和冷漠的态度看待所有这些讨论了。目前，他们似乎处于一种非常可悲的状态，就像诗人在描述<i class="calibre10">西西弗斯和</i> <i class="calibre10">坦塔罗斯</i>的惩罚时，只给了我们一个模糊的概念。因为还有什么能比急切地寻找永远逃离我们的东西，并在一个它不可能存在的地方寻找它，更让人感到煎熬呢？</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But as nature seems to have observ'd a kind of justice and compensation in every thing, she has not neglected philosophers more than the rest of the creation; but has reserv'd them a consolation amid all their disappointments and afflictions. This consolation principally consists in their invention of the words <i class="calibre10">faculty</i> and <i class="calibre10">occult quality</i>. For it being usual, after the frequent use of terms, which are really significant and intelligible, to omit the idea, which we wou'd express by them, and to preserve only the custom, by which we recal the idea at pleasure; so it naturally happens, that after the frequent use of terms, which are wholly insignificant and unintelligible, we fancy them to be on the same footing with the precedent, and to have a secret meaning, which we might discover by reflection. The resemblance of their appearance deceives the mind, as is usual, and makes us imagine a thorough resemblance and conformity. By this means these philosophers set themselves at ease, and arrive at last, by an illusion, at the same indifference, which the people attain by their stupidity, and true philosophers by their moderate scepticism. They need only say, that any phænomenon, which puzzles them, arises from a faculty or an occult quality, and there is an end of all dispute and enquiry upon the matter.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，由于大自然似乎在每件事情上都遵守一种公正和补偿，她对哲学家的忽视并不比其他受造物多；而是在他们所有的失望和痛苦中给他们保留了一种安慰。这种安慰主要包括他们发明的<i class="calibre10">能力</i>和<i class="calibre10">神秘的品质</i>这两个词。因为通常情况下，在经常使用真正有意义和可理解的术语之后，我们会省略我们想用它们表达的想法，而只保留我们乐意回忆这个想法的习惯；所以自然会发生这样的情况：在经常使用完全无意义和不可理解的术语之后，我们认为它们与前面的术语处于相同的地位，并且有一个秘密的含义，我们可以通过思考发现。它们外表的相似性欺骗了我们的心灵，就像往常一样，使我们想象出一种彻底的相似性和一致性。通过这种方式，这些哲学家让自己轻松起来，并通过一种幻觉最终达到了同样的冷漠，而这种冷漠是人们通过愚蠢达到的，是真正的哲学家通过温和的怀疑主义达到的。他们只需要说，任何令他们困惑的现象都是由一种能力或一种神秘的品质引起的，那么在这个问题上所有的争论和探究都将结束。</p></div>

There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature, to bestow on external objects the same emotions, which it observes in itself; and to find every where those ideas, which are most present to it. This inclination, 'tis true, is suppress'd by a little reflection, and only takes place in children, poets, and the antient philosophers. It appears in children, by their desire of beating the stones, which hurt them: In poets, by their readiness to personify every thing: And in the antient philosophers, by these fictions of sympathy and antipathy.

		<p class="block_6 en">But here it may be objected, that the imagination, according to my own confession, being the ultimate judge of all systems of philosophy, I am unjust in blaming the antient philosophers for makeing use of that faculty, and allowing themselves to be entirely guided by it in their reasonings. In order to justify myself, I must distinguish in the imagination betwixt the principles which are permanent, irresistible, and universal; such as the customary tradition from causes to effects, and from effects to causes: And the principles, which are changeable, weak, and irregular; such as those I have just now taken notice of. The former are the foundation of all our thoughts and actions, so that upon their removal human nature must immediately perish and go to ruin. The latter are neither unavoidable to mankind, nor necessary, or so much as useful in the conduct of life; but on the contrary are observ'd only to take place in weak minds, and being opposite to the other principles of custom and reasoning, may easily be subverted by a due contrast and opposition. For this reason the former are received by philosophy, and the latter rejected. One who concludes somebody to be near him, when he hears an articulate voice in the dark, reasons justly and naturally; tho' that conclusion be deriv'd from nothing but custom, which infixes and inlivens the idea of a human creature, on account of his usual conjunction with the present impression. But one, who is tormented he knows not why, with the apprehension of spectres in the dark, may, perhaps, be said to reason, and to reason naturally too: But then it must be in the same sense, that a malady is said to be natural; as arising from natural causes, tho' it be contrary to health, the most agreeable and most natural situation of man. The opinions of the antient philosophers, their fictions of substance and accident, and their reasonings concerning substantial forms and occult qualities, are like the spectres in the dark, and are deriv'd from principles, which, however common, are neither universal nor unavoidable in human nature. The <i class="calibre10">modern philosophy</i> pretends to be entirely free from this defect, and to arise only from the solid, permanent, and consistent principles of the imagination. Upon what grounds this pretension is founded must now be the subject of our enquiry.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但在此可以反对，根据我自己的承认，想象力是所有哲学体系的最终评判者，我责备古代哲学家利用这种能力，并允许自己在推理中完全受其指导，是不公正的。为了自圆其说，我必须在想象中区分永久的、不可抗拒的和普遍的原则；比如从因到果、从果到因的习惯性传统。和那些易变的、软弱的、不规则的原则；比如我刚才提到的那些。前者是我们所有思想和行为的基础，因此，一旦它们被移除，人类的本性就必须立即灭亡，走向毁灭。后者既不是人类不可避免的，也不是必要的，更不是对生活有帮助的；相反，人们只注意到在软弱的头脑中发生，而且与习俗和推理的其他原则相反，很容易被适当的对比和反对所颠覆。因此，前者被哲学所接受，而后者被拒绝。当一个人在黑暗中听到一个清晰的声音时，他断定有人在他身边，他的理由是公正和自然的；尽管这个结论只是从习惯中推导出来的，因为习惯把人的概念加进去，因为他通常与现在的印象联系在一起。但是，一个不知道为什么被折磨着的人，在黑暗中对幽灵的担忧，也许可以说是在推理，而且是自然地推理。但是，必须在同样的意义上说，一种疾病被说成是自然的；因为它产生于自然的原因，尽管它违背了健康，人类最令人愉快和最自然的状况。古代哲学家的观点，他们对物质和意外的虚构，以及他们对实质形式和神秘品质的推理，就像黑暗中的幽灵，是由一些原则派生出来的，而这些原则无论多么常见，在人性中既不普遍也不可避免。<i class="calibre10">现代哲学</i>自称完全没有这种缺陷，而只是从想象力的坚实、永久和一致的原则中产生。现在，我们必须对这种说法的依据进行调查。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The fundamental principle of that philosophy is the opinion concerning colours, sounds, tastes, smells, heat and cold; which it asserts to be nothing but impressions in the mind, deriv'd from the operation of external objects, and without any resemblance to the qualities of the objects. Upon examination, I find only one of the reasons commonly produc'd for this opinion to be satisfactory, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that deriv'd from the variations of those impressions, even while the external object, to all appearance, continues the same. These variations depend upon several circumstances. Upon the different situations of our health: A man in a malady feels a disagreeable taste in meats, which before pleas'd him the most. Upon the different complexions and constitutions of men: That seems bitter to one, which is sweet to another. Upon the difference of their external situation and position: Colours reflected from the clouds change according to the distance of the clouds, and according to the angle they make with the eye and luminous body. Fire also communicates the sensation of pleasure at one distance, and that of pain at another. Instances of this kind are very numerous and frequent.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种哲学的基本原则是关于颜色、声音、味道、气味、热度和冷度的观点；它断言，这些东西只不过是在头脑中的印象，是由外部物体的作用而产生的，与物体的品质没有任何相似之处。经过研究，我发现通常为这种观点提出的理由中只有一个是令人满意的，<i class="calibre10">即</i>从这些印象的变化中得出的，即使外部物体，在所有的外表下，仍然是一样的。这些变化取决于几种情况。在我们健康的不同情况下。一个患有疾病的人对肉食感到不舒服，而在以前他是最喜欢的。人的肤色和体质不同。对一个人来说是苦的，对另一个人来说是甜的。在他们外部情况和位置的不同上。从云层中反射出来的颜色会根据云层的距离以及它们与眼睛和发光体的角度而变化。火也会在某一距离传达快乐的感觉，而在另一距离传达痛苦的感觉。这样的例子非常多，也非常频繁。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The conclusion drawn from them, is likewise as satisfactory as can possibly be imagin'd. 'Tis certain, that when different impressions of the same sense arise from any object, every one of these impressions has not a resembling quality existent in the object. For as the same object cannot, at the same time, be endow'd with different qualities of the same sense, and as the same quality cannot resemble impressions entirely different; it evidently follows, that many of our impressions have no external model or archetype. Now from like effects we presume like causes. Many of the impressions of colour, sound, <i class="calibre10">&amp;c.</i> are confest to he nothing but internal existences, and to arise from causes, which no ways resemble them. These impressions are in appearance nothing different from the other impressions of colour, sound, <i class="calibre10">&amp;c.</i> We conclude, therefore, that they are, all of them, deriv'd from a like origin.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从它们得出的结论，也同样是可以想象的令人满意的。可以肯定的是，当同一感官的不同印象从任何物体中产生时，这些印象中的每一个都没有存在于物体中的相似品质。因为同一物体不可能同时被赋予同一感官的不同品质，而且同一品质不可能与完全不同的印象相似；显然，我们的许多印象没有外部模型或原型。现在，我们从相似的效果推测出相似的原因。许多颜色、声音<i class="calibre10">等</i>的印象被证实只是内部的存在，并来自于与它们毫不相像的原因。这些印象在外观上与其他颜色、声音等的印象没有什么不同<i class="calibre10">。</i>因此，我们的结论是，它们都是由一个类似的起源衍生出来的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This principle being once admitted, all the other doctrines of that philosophy seem to follow by an easy consequence. For upon the removal of sounds, colours, heat, cold, and other sensible qualities, from the rank of continu'd independent existences, we are reduc'd merely to what are called primary qualities, as the only <i class="calibre10">real</i> ones, of which we have any adequate notion. These primary qualities are extension and solidity, with their different mixtures and modifications; figure, motion, gravity, and cohesion. The generation, encrease, decay, and corruption of animals and vegetables, are nothing but changes of figure and motion; as also the operations of all bodies on each other; of fire, of light, water, air, earth, and of all the elements and powers of nature. One figure and motion produces another figure and motion; nor does there remain in the material universe any other principle, either active or passive, of which we can form the most distant idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个原则一旦被承认，该哲学的所有其他学说似乎都会因一个简单的结果而得到遵循。因为一旦把声音、颜色、热、冷和其他感性品质从持续的独立存在的等级中剔除，我们就只剩下所谓的初级品质了，因为这是唯一<i class="calibre10">真实的</i>品质，我们对它有充分的概念。这些主要的品质是延伸性和稳固性，以及它们不同的混合物和变体；形状、运动、重力和凝聚力。动物和蔬菜的生成、增加、衰亡和腐败，无非是形状和运动的变化；同样，所有物体的相互作用也是如此；火、光、水、空气、土以及自然界的所有元素和力量也是如此。一个图形和运动产生另一个图形和运动；在物质宇宙中也不存在任何其他原则，无论是主动的还是被动的，我们可以形成最遥远的概念。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I believe many objections might be made to this system: But at present I shall confine myself to one, which is in my opinion very decisive. I assert, that instead of explaining the operations of external objects by its means, we utterly annihilate all these objects, and reduce ourselves to the opinions of the most extravagant scepticism concerning them. If colours, sounds, tastes, and smells be merely perceptions, nothing we can conceive is possest of a real, continu'd, and independent existence; not even motion, extension and solidity, which are the primary qualities chiefly insisted on.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我相信对这一制度可以提出许多反对意见。但目前我只谈一个，在我看来是非常决定性的。我断言，我们不是用它来解释外部物体的作用，而是彻底消灭了所有这些物体，并使我们自己沦为对它们最奢侈的怀疑论的观点。如果颜色、声音、味道和气味仅仅是感知，那么我们所能想象的任何东西都不具备真实的、持续的和独立的存在；甚至连运动、延伸和坚固性也不具备，而这些是主要坚持的主要品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the examination of motion; 'tis evident this is a quality altogether inconceivable alone, and without a reference to some other object. The idea of motion necessarily supposes that of a body moving. Now what is our idea of the moving body, without which motion is incomprehensible? It must resolve itself into the idea of extension or of solidity; and consequently the reality of motion depends upon that of these other qualities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先是对运动的研究；很明显，这是一个单独的、不与其他物体相联系的、完全无法想象的品质。运动的概念必然假定有一个身体在运动。现在，我们对运动体的概念是什么，没有这个概念，运动是不可理解的？它必须转化为延伸性或稳固性的概念；因此，运动的现实性取决于这些其他品质的现实性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This opinion, which is universally acknowledge'd concerning motion, I have prov'd to be true with regard to extension; and have shewn that 'tis impossible to conceive extension, but as compos'd of parts, endow'd with colour or solidity. The idea of extension is a compound idea; but as it is not compounded of an infinite number of parts or inferior ideas, it must at last resolve itself into such as are perfectly simple and indivisible. These simple and indivisible parts, not being ideas of extension, must be non-entities, unless conceiv'd as colour'd or solid. Colour is excluded from any real existence. The reality, therefore, of our idea of extension depends upon the reality of that of solidity, nor can the former be just while the latter is chimerical. Let us, then, lend our attention to the examination of the idea of solidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个在运动方面被普遍承认的观点，我已经证明了在延伸方面的真实性；并且已经证明，除了由被赋予颜色或实体的部分组成之外，不可能想象出延伸。延展的概念是一个复合的概念；但由于它不是由无限多的部分或低级的概念组成的，它最后必须将自己分解为完全简单和不可分割的部分。这些简单而不可分割的部分，不属于延伸的观念，必须是非实体的，除非被设想为颜色或实体。颜色被排除在任何实际存在之外。因此，我们的延伸概念的真实性取决于实体概念的真实性，前者不可能是公正的，而后者则是虚构的。那么，让我们把注意力转移到对实体性概念的研究上。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The idea of solidity is that of two objects, which being impell'd by the utmost force, cannot penetrate each other; but still maintain a separate and distinct existence. Solidity, therefore, is perfectly incomprehensible alone, and without the conception of some bodies, which are solid, and maintain this separate and distinct existence. Now what idea have we of these bodies? The ideas of colours, sounds, and other secondary qualities are excluded. The idea of motion depends on that of extension, and the idea of extension on that of solidity. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that the idea of solidity can depend on either of them. For that wou'd be to run in a circle, and make one idea depend on another, while at the same time the latter depends on the former. Our modern philosophy, therefore, leaves us no just nor satisfactory idea of solidity; nor consequently of matter.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">固体的概念是指两个物体，它们被最大的力量所推动，不能穿透对方；但仍然保持着独立和不同的存在。因此，如果没有一些物体的概念，实体性是完全无法理解的，这些物体是固体，并保持这种单独和独特的存在。现在我们对这些身体有什么概念呢？颜色、声音和其他次要品质的概念被排除在外。运动的概念取决于延伸的概念，而延伸的概念则取决于实体的概念。因此，实体性的概念不可能取决于其中任何一个。因为那将是在绕圈子，使一个概念依赖于另一个概念，而同时后者又依赖于前者。因此，我们的现代哲学没有给我们留下关于实体性的公正或令人满意的概念；因此，也没有留下关于物质的概念。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This argument will appear entirely conclusive to every one that comprehends it; but because it may seem abstruse and intricate to the generality of readers, I hope to be excus'd, if I endeavour to render it more obvious by some variation of the expression. In order to form an idea of solidity, we must conceive two bodies pressing on each other without any penetration; and 'tis impossible to arrive at this idea, when we confine ourselves to one object, much more without conceiving any. Two non-entities cannot exclude each other from their places; because they never possess any place, nor can be endow'd with any quality. Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong? To say, that we conceive them merely as solid, is to run on <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>. To affirm, that we paint them out to ourselves as extended, either resolves all into a false idea, or returns in a circle. Extension must necessarily be consider'd either as colour'd, which is a false idea; or as solid, which brings us back to the first question. We may make the same observation concerning mobility and figure; and upon the whole must conclude, that after the exclusion of colours, sounds, heat and cold from the rank of external existences, there remains nothing, which can afford us a just and consistent idea of body.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个论点对每一个理解它的人来说都是完全结论性的；但由于它对广大读者来说可能显得深奥和错综复杂，如果我努力通过一些表达方式的变化使它更加明显，我希望能够得到原谅。为了形成稳固性的概念，我们必须设想两个物体在没有任何穿透力的情况下相互压迫；而当我们把自己局限于一个物体时，就不可能得出这个概念，更不用说没有任何设想了。两个非实体不能把对方排除在它们的位置之外；因为它们从不拥有任何位置，也不能被赋予任何质量。现在我问，我们对这些我们认为属于实体的身体或物体形成什么概念？如果说我们仅仅把它们想象成固体，那就是在<i class="calibre10">无休止</i>地进行下去。申明我们把它们描绘成延伸的，要么是把所有的东西都化为一个错误的概念，要么是在一个循环中返回。延伸必须被认为是彩色的，这是一个错误的概念；或者是固体的，这使我们回到了第一个问题。我们可以对移动性和形状做同样的观察；总的来说，我们必须得出结论，在把颜色、声音、热和冷从外部存在的等级中排除之后，就没有什么能给我们提供一个关于身体的公正和一致的概念。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Add to this, that, properly speaking, solidity or impenetrability is nothing, but an impossibility of annihilation, as<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-419" id="calibre_link-430" title="36">36</a></sup> has been already observ'd: For which reason 'tis the more necessary for us to form some distinct idea of that object, whose annihilation we suppose impossible. An impossibility of being annihilated cannot exist, and can never be conceived to exist, by itself; but necessarily requires some object or real existence, to which it may belong. Now the difficulty still remains, how to form an idea of this object or existence, without having recourse to the secondary and sensible qualities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，正确地说，坚固性或不可渗透性只不过是一种不可能消灭的现象，正如<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-419" id="calibre_link-430" title="36">36</a></sup>我们已经看到了。因此，我们更有必要对我们认为不可能湮灭的物体形成一些独特的概念。一个不可能被消灭的事物本身不可能存在，也不可能被设想为存在；而是必然需要一些对象或实际存在，它可能属于这些对象。现在，困难仍然存在，如何形成对这个对象或存在的概念，而不求助于次要的和可感的品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor must we omit on this occasion our accustom'd method of examining ideas by considering those impressions, from which they are deriv'd. The impressions, which enter by the sight and hearing, the smell and taste, are affirm'd by modern philosophy to be without any resembling objects; and consequently the idea of solidity, which is suppos'd to be real, can never be deriv'd from any of these senses. There remains, therefore, the feeling as the only sense, that can convey the impression, which is original to the idea of solidity; and indeed we naturally imagine, that we feel the solidity of bodies, and need but touch any object in order to perceive this quality. But this method of thinking is more popular than philosophical; as will appear from the following reflections.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这种情况下，我们也不能省略我们习惯的方法，即通过考虑它们所衍生的那些印象来检验观念。通过视觉和听觉、嗅觉和味觉进入的印象，被现代哲学确认为没有任何类似的对象；因此，被认为是真实的实体性观念，永远不可能从这些感官中派生出来。因此，感觉是唯一能够传递印象的感官，而这种印象是实体性概念的原点；事实上，我们自然而然地想象，我们能感觉到身体的实体性，而且只需要触摸任何物体就能感知到这种品质。但这种思维方法是流行的，而不是哲学的；从下面的思考中可以看出。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, 'Tis easy to observe, that tho' bodies are felt by means of their solidity, yet the feeling is a quite different thing from the solidity; and that they have not the least resemblance to each other. A man, who has the palsey in one hand, has as perfect an idea of impenetrability, when he observes that hand to be supported by the table, as when he feels the same table with the other hand. An object, that presses upon any of our members, meets with resistance; and that resistance, by the motion it gives to the nerves and animal spirits, conveys a certain sensation to the mind; but it does not follow, that the sensation, motion, and resistance are any ways resembling.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们很容易观察到，尽管身体是通过它们的坚固性来感受的，但这种感受与坚固性是完全不同的；它们之间没有丝毫的相似之处。一个人，如果一只手有麻痹，当他观察到那只手被桌子支撑着时，与他用另一只手感觉到同一张桌子时一样，有一种完美的不可穿透的想法。一个物体压在我们的任何部件上，都会遇到阻力；这种阻力通过它给神经和动物精神带来的运动，给心灵带来某种感觉；但这并不意味着，这种感觉、运动和阻力有任何相似之处。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, The impressions of touch are simple impressions, except when consider'd with regard to their extension; which makes nothing to the present purpose: And from this simplicity I infer, that they neither represent solidity, nor any, real object. For let us put two cases, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that of a man, who presses a stone, or any solid body, with his hand, and that of two stones, which press each other; 'twill readily be allow'd, that these two cases are not in every respect alike, but that in the former there is conjoin'd with the solidity, a feeling or sensation, of which there is no appearance in the latter. In order, therefore, to make these two cases alike, 'tis necessary to remove some part of the impression, which the man feels by his hand, or organ of sensation; and that being impossible in a simple impression, obliges us to remove the whole, and proves that this whole impression has no archetype or model in external objects. To which we may add, that solidity necessarily supposes two bodies, along with contiguity and impulse; which being a compound object, can never be represented by a simple impression. Not to mention, that tho' solidity continues always invariably the same, the impressions of touch change every moment upon us; which is a clear proof that the latter are not representations of the former.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，触摸的印象是简单的印象，除非考虑到它们的延伸；这对目前的目的没有任何意义：从这种简单性我推断，它们既不代表实体，也不代表任何真实的物体。因为让我们举两个例子，<i class="calibre10">即</i>一个人用手按压石头或任何固体物体，以及两块石头互相按压；我们很容易就会发现，这两种情况在各方面都不一样，但在前者中，有一种感觉或感受与固体结合在一起，而在后者中却没有出现。因此，为了使这两种情况相同，有必要去除印象的某些部分，即人通过他的手或感觉器官感受到的部分；而这在一个简单的印象中是不可能的，因此我们必须去除整个印象，并证明整个印象在外部物体中没有原型或模式。对此，我们可以补充说，实体性必然假定有两个身体，以及毗连性和冲力；作为一个复合物体，它永远不可能被一个简单的印象所代表。更不用说，尽管实体性总是不变的，但触摸的印象在我们身上每时每刻都在变化；这清楚地证明了后者不是前者的代表。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus there is a direct and total opposition betwixt our reason and our senses; or more properly speaking, betwixt those conclusions we form from cause and effect, and those that persuade us of the continu'd and independent existence of body. When we reason from cause and effect, we conclude, that neither colour, sound, taste, nor smell have a continu'd and independent existence. When we exclude these sensible qualities there remains nothing in the universe, which has such an existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在我们的理性和我们的感官之间存在着直接和完全的对立；或者更恰当地说，在我们从因果关系形成的结论和那些说服我们身体的持续和独立存在的结论之间存在着对立。当我们从因果关系中推理时，我们的结论是：颜色、声音、味道或气味都没有持续和独立的存在。当我们排除了这些感性的品质，宇宙中就没有任何东西具有这样的存在。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">If instead of answering these questions, any one shou'd evade the difficulty, by saying, that the definition of a substance is <i class="calibre10">something which may exist by itself;</i> and that this definition ought to satisfy us: Shou'd this be said, I shou'd observe, that this definition agrees to every thing, that can possibly be conceiv'd; and never will serve to distinguish substance from accident, or the soul from its perceptions. For thus I reason. Whatever is clearly conceiv'd may exist; and whatever is clearly conceiv'd, after any manner, may exist after the same manner. This is one principle, which has been already acknowledg'd. Again, every thing, which is different, is distinguishable, and every thing which is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination. This is another principle. My conclusion from both is, that since all our perceptions are different from each other, and from every thing else in the universe, they are also distinct and separable, and may be consider'd as separately existent, and may exist separately, and have no need of any thing else to support their existence. They are, therefore, substances, as far as this definition explains a substance.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果有人不回答这些问题，而是回避困难，说物质的定义是<i class="calibre10">可以自行存在的东西；</i>而且这个定义应该让我们满意。如果这样说，我就会说，这个定义符合每一件可能被设想的事情；而且永远不会用于区分物质和意外，或者灵魂和它的感知。因为我是这样推理的。凡是明确设想的，都可以存在；凡是明确设想的，以任何方式，都可以以同样的方式存在。这是一个原则，已经被承认了。另外，每件不同的东西都是可以区分的，每件可以区分的东西都是可以通过想象力分离的。这是另一个原则。我从这两方面得出的结论是，既然我们所有的感知都是彼此不同的，也是与宇宙中的其他事物不同的，那么它们也是有区别的、可分离的，可以被认为是单独存在的，可以单独存在，不需要任何其他东西来支持它们的存在。因此，就这个定义对物质的解释而言，它们是物质。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus neither by considering the first origin of ideas, nor by means of a definition are we able to arrive at any satisfactory notion of substance; which seems to me a sufficient reason for abandoning utterly that dispute concerning the materiality and immateriality of the soul, and makes me absolutely condemn even the question itself. We have no perfect idea of any thing but of a perception. A substance is entirely different from a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of a substance. Inhesion in something is suppos'd to be requisite to support the existence of our perceptions. Nothing appears requisite to support the existence of a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of inhesion.

Whatever is extended consists of parts; and whatever consists of parts is divisible, if not in reality, at least in the imagination. But 'tis impossible any thing divisible can be <i class="calibre10">conjoin'd</i> to a thought or perception, which is a being altogether inseparable and indivisible. For supposing such a conjunction, wou'd the indivisible thought exist on the left or on the right hand of this extended divisible body? On the surface or in the middle? On the back- or fore-side of it? If it be conjoin'd with the extension, it must exist somewhere within its dimensions. If it exist within its dimensions, it must either exist in one particular part; and then that particular part is indivisible, and the perception is conjoin'd only with it, not with the extension: Or if the thought exists in every part, it must also be extended, and separable, and divisible, as well as the body; which is utterly absurd and contradictory. For can any one conceive a passion of a yard in length, a foot in breadth, and an inch in thickness?

A moral reflection cannot be plac'd on the right or on the left hand of a passion, nor can a smell or sound be either of a circular or a square figure. These objects and perceptions, so far from requiring any particular place, are absolutely incompatible with it, and even the imagination cannot attribute it to them. And as to the absurdity of supposing them to be no where, we may consider, that if the passions and sentiments appear to the perception to have any particular place, the idea of extension might be deriv'd from them, as well as from the sight and touch; contrary to what we have already establish'd.

That table, which just now appears to me, is only a perception, and all its qualities are qualities of a perception. Now the most obvious of all its qualities is extension. The perception consists of parts. These parts are so situated, as to afford us the notion of distance and contiguity; of length, breadth, and thickness. The termination of these three dimensions is what we call figure. This figure is moveable, separable, and divisible. Mobility, and separability are the distinguishing properties of extended objects. And to cut short all disputes, the very idea of extension is copy'd from nothing but an impression, and consequently must perfectly agree to it, To say the idea of extension agrees to any thing, is to say it is extended. The free-thinker may now triumph in his turn; and having found there are impressions and ideas really extended, may ask his antagonists, how they can incorporate a simple and indivisible subject with an extended perception? All the arguments of Theologians may here be retorted upon them. Is the indivisible subject, or immaterial substance, if you will, on the left or on the right hand of the perception? Is it in this particular part, or in that other? Is it in every part without being extended? Or is it entire in any one part without deserting the rest?

		<p class="block_6 en">The consequence I shall draw from this may, at first sight, appear a mere sophism; but upon the least examination will be found solid and satisfactory. I say then, that since we may suppose, but never can conceive a specific difference betwixt an object and impression; any conclusion we form concerning the connexion and repugnance of impressions, will not be known certainly to be applicable to objects; but that on the other hand, whatever conclusions of this kind we form concerning objects, will most certainly be applicable to impressions. The reason is not difficult. As an object is suppos'd to be different from an impression, we cannot be sure, that the circumstance, upon which we found our reasoning, is common to both, supposing we form the reasoning upon the impression. 'Tis still possible, that the object may differ from it in that particular. But when we first form our reasoning concerning the object, 'tis beyond doubt, that the same reasoning must extend to the impression: And that because the quality of the object, upon which the argument is founded, must at least be conceiv'd by the mind; and cou'd not be conceiv'd, unless it were common to an impression; since we have no idea but what is deriv'd from that origin. Thus we may establish it as a certain maxim, that we can never, by any principle, but by an irregular kind<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-136" id="calibre_link-11" title="40">40</a></sup> of reasoning from experience, discover a connexion or repugnance betwixt objects, which extends not to impressions; tho' the inverse proposition may not be equally true, that all the discoverable relations of impressions are common to objects.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To apply this to the present case; there are two different systems of beings presented, to which I suppose myself under a necessity of assigning some substance, or ground of inhesion. I observe first the universe of objects or of body: The sun, moon and stars; the earth, seas, plants, animals, men, ships, houses, and other productions either of art or nature. Here <i class="calibre10">Spinoza</i> appears, and tells me, that these are only modifications; and that the subject, in which they inhere, is simple, in compounded, and indivisible. After this I consider the other system of beings, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the universe of thought, or my impressions and ideas. There I observe another sun, moon and stars; an earth, and seas, cover'd and inhabited by plants and animals; towns, houses, mountains, rivers; and in short every thing I can discover or conceive in the first system. Upon my enquiring concerning these, Theologians present themselves, and tell me, that these also are modifications, and modifications of one simple, uncompounded, and indivisible substance. Immediately upon which I am deafen'd with the noise of a hundred voices, that treat the first hypothesis with detestation and scorn, and the second with applause and veneration. I turn my attention to these hypotheses to see what may be the reason of so great a partiality; and find that they have the same fault of being unintelligible, and that as far as we can understand them, they are so much alike, that 'tis impossible to discover any absurdity in one, which is not common to both of them. We have no idea of any quality in an object, which does not agree to, and may not represent a quality in an impression; and that because all our ideas are deriv'd from our impressions. We can never, therefore, find any repugnance betwixt an extended object as a modification, and a simple uncompounded essence, as its substance, unless that repugnance takes place equally betwixt the perception or impression of that extended object, and the same uncompounded essence. Every idea of a quality in an object passes thro' an impression; and therefore every <i class="calibre10">perceivable</i> relation, whether of connexion or repugnance, must be common both to objects and impressions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">First, It has been said against <i class="calibre10">Spinoza</i>, according to the scholastic way of talking, rather than thinking, that a mode, not being any distinct or separate existence, must be the very same with its substance, and consequently the extension of the universe, must be in a manner identify'd with that simple, uncompounded essence, in which the universe is suppos'd to inhere. But this, it may be pretended, is utterly impossible and inconceivable unless the indivisible substance expand itself; so as to correspond to the extension, or the extension contract itself, so as to answer to the indivisible substance. This argument seems just, as far as we can understand it; and 'tis plain nothing is requir'd, but a change in the terms, to apply the same argument to our extended perceptions, and the simple essence of the soul; the ideas of objects and perceptions being in every respect the same, only attended with the supposition of a difference, that is unknown and incomprehensible.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">First, I observe, that the word, action, according to this explication of it, can never justly be apply'd to any perception, as deriv'd from a mind or thinking substance. Our perceptions are all really different, and separable, and distinguishable from each other, and from every thing else, which we can imagine; and therefore 'tis impossible to conceive, how they can be the action or abstract mode of any substance. The instance of motion, which is commonly made use of to shew after what manner perception depends, as an action, upon its substance, rather confounds than instructs us. Motion to all appearance induces no real nor essential change on the body, but only varies its relation to other objects. But betwixt a person in the morning walking in a garden with company, agreeable to him; and a person in the afternoon inclos'd in a dungeon, and full of terror, despair, and resentment, there seems to be a radical difference, and of quite another kind, than what is produc'd on a body by the change of its situation. As we conclude from the distinction and separability of their ideas, that external objects have a separate existence from each other; so when we make these ideas themselves our objects, we must draw the same conclusion concerning <i class="calibre10">them</i>, according to the precedent reasoning. At least it must be confest, that having no idea of the substance of the soul, 'tis impossible for us to tell how it can admit of such differences, and even contrarieties of perception without any fundamental change; and consequently can never tell in what sense perceptions are actions of that substance. The use, therefore, of the word, <i class="calibre10">action</i>, unaccompany'd with any meaning, instead of that of modification, makes no addition to our knowledge, nor is of any advantage to the doctrine of the immateriality of the soul.</p>

This you'll say is utterly absurd.

		<p class="block_6 en">Few have been able to withstand the seeming evidence of this argument; and yet nothing in the world is more easy than to refute it. We need only reflect on what has been prov'd at large, that we are never sensible of any connexion betwixt causes and effects, and that 'tis only by our experience of their constant conjunction, we can arrive at any knowledge of this relation. Now as all objects, which are not contrary, are susceptible of a constant conjunction, and as no real objects are contrary;  <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-138" id="calibre_link-265" title="42">42</a></sup>I have inferr'd from these principles, that to consider the matter <i class="calibre10">a priori</i> any thing may produce any thing, and that we shall never discover a reason, why any object may or may not be the cause of any other, however great, or however little the resemblance may be betwixt them. This evidently destroys the precedent reasoning concerning the cause of thought or perception. For tho' there appear no manner of connexion betwixt motion or thought, the case is the same with all other causes and effects. Place one body of a pound weight on one end of a lever, and another body of the same weight on another end; you will never find in these bodies any principle of motion dependent on their distances from the center, more than of thought and perception. If you pretend, therefore, to prove <i class="calibre10">a priori</i> that such a position of bodies can never cause thought; because turn it which way you will, 'tis nothing but a position of bodies; you must by the same course of reasoning conclude, that it can never produce motion; since there is no more apparent connexion in the one case than in the other. But as this latter conclusion is contrary to evident experience, and as 'tis possible we may have a like experience in the operations of the mind, and may perceive a constant conjunction of thought and motion; you reason too hastily, when from the mere consideration of the ideas, you conclude that 'tis impossible motion can ever produce thought, or a different position of parts give rise to a different passion or reflection. Nay 'tis not only possible we may have such an experience, but 'tis certain we have it; since every one may perceive, that the different dispositions of his body change his thoughts and sentiments. And shou'd it be said, that this depends on the union of soul and body; I wou'd answer, that we must separate the question concerning the substance of the mind from that concerning the cause of its thought; and that confining ourselves to the latter question we find by the comparing their ideas, that thought and motion are different from each other, and by experience, that they are constantly united; which being all the circumstances, that enter into the idea of cause and effect, when apply'd to the operations of matter, we may certainly conclude, that motion may be, and actually is, the cause of thought and perception.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There seems only this dilemma left us in the present case; either to assert, that nothing can be the cause of another, but where the mind can perceive the connexion in its idea of the objects: Or to maintain, that all objects, which we find constantly conjoin'd, are upon that account to be regarded as causes and effects. If we choose the first part of the dilemma, these are the consequences. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, We in reality affirm, that there is no such thing in the universe as a cause or productive principle, not even the deity himself; since our idea of that supreme Being is deriv'd from particular impressions, none of which contain any efficacy, nor seem to have <i class="calibre10">any</i> connexion with <i class="calibre10">any</i> other existence. As to what may be said, that the connexion betwixt the idea of an infinitely powerful being, and that of any effect, which he wills, is necessary and unavoidable; I answer, that we have no idea of a being endow'd with any power, much less of one endow'd with infinite power. But if we will change expressions, we can only define power by connexion; and then in saying, that the idea of an infinitely powerful being is connected with that of every effect, which he wills, we really do no more than assert, that a being, whose volition is connected with every effect, is connected with every effect; which is an identical proposition, and gives us no insight into the nature of this power or connexion. But, <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, supposing, that the deity were the great and efficacious principle, which supplies the deficiency of all causes, this leads us into the grossest impieties and absurdities. For upon the same account, that we have recourse to him in natural operations, and assert that matter cannot of itself communicate motion, or produce thought, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> because there is no apparent connexion betwixt these objects; I say, upon the very same account, we must acknowledge that the deity is the author of all our volitions and perceptions; since they have no more apparent connexion either with one another, or with the suppos'd but unknown substance of the soul. This agency of the supreme Being we know to have been asserted by <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-139" id="calibre_link-327" title="43">43</a></sup>several philosophers with relation to all the actions of the mind, except volition, or rather an inconsiderable part of volition; tho' 'tis easy to perceive, that this exception is a mere pretext, to avoid the dangerous consequences of that doctrine. If nothing be active but what has an apparent power, thought is in no case any more active than matter; and if this inactivity must make us have recourse to a deity, the supreme being is the real cause of all our actions, bad as well as good, vicious as well as virtuous.</p>

To pronounce, then, the final decision upon the whole; the question concerning the substance of the soul is absolutely unintelligible: All our perceptions are not susceptible of a local union, either with what is extended or unextended; there being some of them of the one kind, and some of the other: And as the constant conjunction of objects constitutes the very essence of cause and effect, matter and motion may often be regarded as the causes of thought, as far as we have any notion of that relation.</p>

The strongest sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead of distracting us from this view, only fix it the more intensely, and make us consider their influence on self either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a farther proof of this were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be deriv'd from any fact, of which we are so intimately conscious; nor is there any thing, of which we can be certain, if we doubt of this. Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of self; after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what impression cou'd this idea be deriv'd? This question 'tis impossible to answer without a manifest contradiction and absurdity; and yet 'tis a question, which must necessarily be answer'd, if we wou'd have the idea of self pass for clear and intelligible. It must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression, but that to which our several impressions and ideas are suppos'd to have a reference. If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must continue invariably the same, thro' the whole course of our lives; since self is suppos'd to exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time.

All these are different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other, and may be separately consider'd, and may exist separately, and have no need of any thing to support their existence. After what manner, therefore, do they belong to self; and how are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of myself and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself; I must confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd, which he calls himself; tho' I am certain there is no such principle in me.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions. Our thought is still more variable than our sight; and all our other senses and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there any single power of the soul, which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment. The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different; whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the materials, of which it is compos'd.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted existence thro' the whole course of our lives? In order to answer this question, we must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the concern we take in ourselves. The first is our present subject; and to explain it perfectly we must take the matter pretty deep, and account for that identity, which we attribute to plants and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt it, and the identity of a self or person.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted thro' a suppos'd variation of time; and this idea we call that of identity or sameness. We have also a distinct idea of several different objects existing in succession, and connected together by a close relation; and this to an accurate view affords as perfect a notion of diversity, as if there was no manner of relation among the objects. But tho' these two ideas of identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves perfectly distinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our common way of thinking they are generally confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, by which we consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which we reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the same to the feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought requir'd in the latter case than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the mind from one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it contemplated one continu'd object. This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that of related objects. However at one instant we may consider the related succession as variable or interrupted, we are sure the next to ascribe to it a perfect identity, and regard it as invariable and uninterrupted. Our propensity to this mistake is so great from the resemblance above-mention'd, that we fall into it before we are aware; and tho' we incessantly correct ourselves by reflection, and return to a more accurate method of thinking, yet we cannot long sustain our philosophy, or take off this biass from the imagination. Our last resource is to yield to it, and boldly assert that these different related objects are in effect the same, however interrupted and variable. In order to justify to ourselves this absurdity, we often feign some new and unintelligible principle, that connects the objects together, and prevents their interruption or variation. Thus we feign the continu'd existence of the perceptions of our senses, to remove the interruption; and run into the notion of a soul, and self and substance, to disguise the variation. But we may farther observe, that where we do not give rise to such a fiction, our propension to confound identity with relation is so great, that we are apt to imagine<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-209" id="calibre_link-382" title="44">44</a></sup> something unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their relation; and this I take to be the case with regard to the identity we ascribe to plants and vegetables. And even when this does not take place, we still feel a propensity to confound these ideas, tho' we are not able fully to satisfy ourselves in that particular, nor find any thing invariable and uninterrupted to justify our notion of identity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus the controversy concerning identity is not merely a dispute of words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper sense, to variable or interrupted objects, our mistake is not confin'd to the expression, but is commonly attended with a fiction, either of something invariable and uninterrupted, or of something mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a propensity to such fictions. What will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to shew from daily experience and observation, that the objects, which are variable or interrupted, and yet are suppos'd to continue the same, are such only as consist of a succession of parts, connected together by resemblance, contiguity, or causation. For as such a succession answers evidently to our notion of diversity, it can only be by mistake we ascribe to it an identity; and as the relation of parts, which leads us into this mistake, is really nothing but a. quality, which produces an association of ideas, and an easy transition of the imagination from one to another, it can only be from the resemblance, which this act of the mind bears to that, by which we contemplate one continu'd object, that the error arises. Our chief business, then, must be to prove, that all objects, to which we ascribe identity, without observing their invariableness and uninterruptedness, are such as consist of a succession of related objects.</p>

But supposing some very small or inconsiderable part to be added to the mass, or subtracted from it; tho' this absolutely destroys the identity of the whole, strictly speaking; yet as we seldom think so accurately, we scruple not to pronounce a mass of matter the same, where we find so trivial an alteration. The passage of the thought from the object before the change to the object after it, is so smooth and easy, that we scarce perceive the transition, and are apt to imagine, that 'tis nothing but a continu'd survey of the same object.</p>

The addition or diminution of a mountain wou'd not be sufficient to produce a diversity in a planet; tho' the change of a very few inches wou'd be able to destroy the identity of some bodies. 'Twill be impossible to account for this, but by reflecting that objects operate upon the mind, and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions not according to their real greatness, but according to their proportion to each other: And therefore, since this interruption makes an object cease to appear the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress of the thought, which constitutes the [perfect?] [imperfect] identity.</p>

A change in any considerable part of a body destroys its identity; but 'tis remarkable, that where the change is produc'd gradually and insensibly we are less apt to ascribe to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no other, than that the mind, in following the successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage from the surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which continu'd perception, it ascribes a continu'd existence and identity to the object.</p>

There is, however, another artifice, by which we may induce the imagination to advance a step farther; and that is, by producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to some common end or purpose. A ship, of which a considerable part has been chang'd by frequent reparations, is still consider'd as the same; nor does the difference of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it. The common end, in which the parts conspire, is the same under all their variations, and affords an easy transition of the imagination from one situation of the body to another.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But this is still more remarkable, when we add a sympathy of parts to their common end, and suppose that they bear to each other, the reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their actions and operations. This is the case with all animals and vegetables; where not only the several parts have a reference to some general purpose, but also a mutual dependance on, and connexion with each other. The effect of so strong a relation is, that tho' every one must allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and animals endure a total change, yet we still attribute identity to them, while their form, size, and substance are entirely alter'd. An oak, that grows from a small plant to a large tree, is still the same oak; tho' there be not one particle of matter, or figure of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man, and is sometimes fat, sometimes lean, without any change in his identity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may also consider the two following phænomena, which are remarkable in their kind. The first is, that tho' we commonly be able to distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet it sometimes happens, that we confound them, and in our thinking and reasoning employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who hears n noise, that is frequently interrupted and renew'd, says, it is still the same noise; tho' 'tis evident the sounds have only a specific identity or resemblance, and there is nothing numerically the same, but the cause, which produc'd them. In like manner it may be said without breach of the propriety of language, that such a church, which was formerly of brick, fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church of free-stone, and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor materials are the same, nor is there any thing common to the two objects, but their relation to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet this alone is sufficient to make us denominate them the same. But we must observe, that in these cases the first object is in a manner annihilated before the second comes into existence; by which means, we are never presented in any one point of time with the idea of difference and multiplicity; and for that reason are less scrupulous in calling them the same.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, We may remark, that tho' in a succession of related objects, it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden nor entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are in their nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden transition, than wou'd otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages. What is natural and essential to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and what is expected makes less impression, and appears of less moment, than what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change of the former kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the thought, has less influence in destroying the identity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We now proceed to explain the nature of personal identity, which has become so great a question in philosophy, especially of late years in England where all the abstruser sciences are study'd with a peculiar ardour and application. And here 'tis evident, the same method of reasoning must be continu'd, which has so successfully explain'd the identity of plants, and animals, and ships, and houses, and of all the compounded and changeable productions either of art or nature. The identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But lest this argument shou'd not convince the reader; tho' in my opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning, which is still closer and more immediate. 'Tis evident, that the identity, which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not able to run the several different perceptions into one, and make them lose their characters of distinction and difference, which are essential to them. 'Tis still true, that every distinct perception, which enters into the composition of the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and distinguishable, and separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive. But, as, notwithstanding this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole train of perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises concerning this relation of identity; whether it be something that really binds our several perceptions together, or only associates their ideas in the imagination. That is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the identity of a person, we observe some real bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the ideas we form of them. This question we might easily decide, if we wou'd recollect what has been already prov'd at large, that the understanding never observes any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cause and effect, when strictly examin'd, resolves itself into a customary association of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and uniting them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union in the imagination, are these three relations above-mention'd. These are the uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them every distinct object is separable by the mind, and may be separately consider'd, and appears not to have any more connexion with any other object, than if disjoin'd by the greatest difference and remoteness. 'Tis, therefore, on some of these three relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation, that identity depends; and as the very essence of these relations consists in their producing an easy transition of ideas; it follows, that our notions of personal identity, proceed entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought along a train of connected ideas, according to the principles above-explain'd.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what relations this uninterrupted progress of our thought is produc'd, when we consider the successive existence of a mind or thinking person.

		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with resemblance; suppose we cou'd see clearly into the breast of another, and observe that succession of perceptions, which constitutes his mind or thinking principle, and suppose that he always preserves the memory of a considerable part of past perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing cou'd more contribute to the bestowing a relation on this succession amidst all its variations. For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily resembles its object, must not the frequent placing of these resembling perceptions in the chain of thought, convey the imagination more easily from one link to another, and make the whole seem like the continuance of one object? In this particular, then, the memory not only discovers the identity, but also contributes to its production, by producing the relation of resemblance among the perceptions. The case is the same whether we consider ourselves or others.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">As to causation; we may observe, that the true idea of the human mind, is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or different existences, which are link'd together by the relation of cause and effect, and mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other. Our impressions give rise to their correspondent ideas; and these ideas in their turn produce other impressions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a third, by which it is expell'd in its turn. In this respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">As memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be consider'd, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person. But having once acquir'd this notion of causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes, and consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory, and can comprehend times, and circumstances, and actions, which we have entirely forgot, but suppose in general to have existed. For how few of our past actions are there, of which we have any memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts and actions on the first of January 1715, the 11th of March 1719, and the 3d of August 1733? Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot the incidents of these days, that the present self is not the same person with the self of that time; and by that means overturn all the most establish'd notions of personal identity? In this view, therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on those, who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity, to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity beyond our memory.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which is of great importance in the present affair, viz. that all the nice and subtile questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical difficulties. Identity depends on the relations of ideas; and these relations produce identity, by means of that easy transition they occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness of the transition may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard, by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they acquire or lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except so far as the relation of parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary principle of union, as we have already observ'd.</p>

From this similarity of operation we attribute a simplicity to it, and feign a principle of union as the support of this simplicity, and the center of all the different parts and qualities of the object.</p>

Without this quality, by which the mind enlivens some ideas beyond others (which seemingly is so trivial, and so little founded on reason) we cou'd never assent to any argument, nor carry our view beyond those few objects, which are present to our senses. Nay, even to these objects we cou'd never attribute any existence, but what was dependent on the senses; and must comprehend them entirely in that succession of perceptions, which constitutes our self or person. Nay farther, even with relation to that succession, we cou'd only admit of those perceptions, which are immediately present to our consciousness, nor cou'd those lively images, with which the memory presents us, be ever receiv'd as true pictures of past perceptions. The memory, senses, and understanding are, therefore, all of them founded on the imagination, or the vivacity of our ideas.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">No wonder a principle so inconstant and fallacious shou'd lead us into errors, when implicitly follow'd (as it must be) in all its variations. 'Tis this principle, which makes us reason from causes and effects; and 'tis the same principle, which convinces us of the continu'd existence of external objects, when absent from the senses. But tho' these two operations be equally natural and necessary in the human mind, yet in some circumstances they are <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-277" id="calibre_link-451" title="45">45</a></sup>directly contrary, nor is it possible for us to reason justly and regularly from causes and effects, and at the same time believe the continu'd existence of matter. How then shall we adjust those principles together? Which of them shall we prefer? Or in case we prefer neither of them, but successively assent to both, as is usual among philosophers, with what confidence can we afterwards usurp that glorious title, when we thus knowingly embrace a manifest contradiction?</p>

But the case is quite contrary. When we trace up the human understanding to its first principles, we find it to lead us into such sentiments, as seem to turn into ridicule all our past pains and industry, and to discourage us from future enquiries. Nothing is more curiously enquir'd after by the mind of man, than the causes of every phænomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate causes, but push on our enquiries, till we arrive at the original and ultimate principle. We wou'd not willingly stop before we are acquainted with that energy in the cause, by which it operates on its effect; that tie, which connects them together; and that efficacious quality, on which the tie depends. This is our aim in all our studies and reflections: And how must we be disappointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or energy lies merely in ourselves, and is nothing but that determination of the mind, which is acquir'd by custom, and causes us to make a transition from an object to its usual attendant, and from the impression of one to the lively idea of the other? Such a discovery not only cuts off all hope of ever attaining satisfaction, but even prevents our very wishes; since it appears, that when we say we desire to know the ultimate and operating principle, as something, which resides in the external object, we either contradict ourselves, or talk without a meaning.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This deficiency in our ideas is not, indeed, perceiv'd in common life, nor are we sensible, that in the most usual conjunctions of cause and effect we are as ignorant of the ultimate principle, which binds them together, as in the most unusual and extraordinary. But this proceeds merely from an illusion of the imagination; and the question is, how far we ought to yield to these illusions. This question is very difficult, and reduces us to a very dangerous dilemma, whichever way we answer it. For if we assent to every trivial suggestion of the fancy; beside that these' suggestions are often contrary to each other; they lead us into such errors, absurdities, and obscurities, that we must at last become asham'd of our credulity. Nothing is more dangerous to reason than the flights of the imagination, and nothing has been the occasion of more mistakes among philosophers. Men of bright fancies may in this respect he compar'd to those angels, whom the scripture represents as cowering their eyes with their wings. This has already appear'd in so many instances, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of enlarging upon it any farther.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But on the other hand, if the consideration of these instances makes us take a resolution to reject all the trivial suggestions of the fancy, and adhere to the understanding, that is, to the general and more established properties of the imagination; even this resolution, if steadily executed, wou'd be dangerous, and attended with the most fatal consequences. For I have already shewn,<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-279" id="calibre_link-223" title="47">47</a></sup> that the understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general principles, entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any proposition, either in philosophy or common life. We save ourselves from this total scepticism only by means of that singular and seemingly trivial property of the fancy, by which we enter with difficulty into remote views of things, and are not able to accompany them with so sensible an impression, as we do those, which are more easy and natural. Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refin'd or elaborate reasoning is ever to be receiv'd? Consider well the consequences of such a principle. By this means you cut off entirely all science and philosophy: You proceed upon one singular quality of the imagination, and by a parity of reason must embrace all of them: And you expresly contradict yourself; since this maxim must be built on the preceding reasoning, which will be allow'd to be sufficiently refin'd and metaphysical. What party, then, shall we choose among these difficulties? If we embrace this principle, and condemn all refin'd reasoning, we run into the most manifest absurdities. If we reject it in favour of these reasonings, we subvert entirely the human understanding. We have, therefore, no choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all. For my part, I know not what ought to be done in the present case. I can only observe what is commonly done; which is, that this difficulty is seldom or never thought of; and even where it has once been present to the mind, is quickly forgot, and leaves but a small impression behind it. Very refin'd reflections have little or no influence upon us; and yet we do not, and cannot establish it for a rule, that they ought not to have any influence; which implies a manifest contradiction.</p>

I cannot forbear having a curiosity to be acquainted with the principles of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation of government, and the cause of those several passions and inclinations, which actuate and govern me. I am uneasy to think I approve of one object, and disapprove of another; call one thing beautiful, and another deform'd; decide concerning truth and falshood, reason and folly, without knowing upon what principles I proceed. I am concern'd for the condition of the learned world, which lies under such a deplorable ignorance in all these particulars. I feel an ambition to arise in me of contributing to the instruction of mankind, and of acquiring a name by my inventions and discoveries. These sentiments spring up naturally in my present disposition; and shou'd I endeavour to banish them, by attaching myself to any other business or diversion, I <i class="calibre10">feel</i> I shou'd be a loser in point of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy. But even suppose this curiosity and ambition shou'd not transport me into speculations without the sphere of common life, it wou'd necessarily happen, that from my very weakness I must be led into such enquiries. 'Tis certain, that superstition is much more bold in its systems and hypotheses than philosophy; and while the latter contents itself with assigning new causes and principles to the phænomena, which appear in the visible world, the former opens a world of its own, and presents us with scenes, and beings, and objects, which are altogether new. Since therefore 'tis almost impossible for the mind of man to rest, like those of beasts, in that narrow circle of objects, which are the subject of daily conversation and action, we ought only to deliberate concerning the choice of our guide, and ought to prefer that which is safest and most agreeable. And in this respect I make bold to recommend philosophy, and shall not scruple to give it the preference to superstition of every kind or denomination. For as superstition arises naturally and easily from the popular opinions of mankind, it seizes more strongly on the mind, and is often able to disturb us in the conduct of our lives and actions. Philosophy on the contrary, if just, can present us only with mild and moderate sentiments; and if false and extravagant, its opinions are merely the objects of a cold and general speculation, and seldom go so far as to interrupt the course of our natural propensities. The Cynics are an extraordinary instance of philosophers, who from reasonings purely philosophical ran into as great extravagances of conduct as any <i class="calibre10">Monk</i> or <i class="calibre10">Dervise</i> that ever was in the world. Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I am sensible, that these two cases of the strength and weakness of the mind will not comprehend all mankind, and that there are in England in particular, many honest gentlemen, who being always employ'd in their domestic affairs, or amusing themselves in common recreations, have carried their thoughts very little beyond those objects, which are every day expos'd to their senses. And indeed, of such as these I pretend not to make philosophers, nor do I expect them either to be associates in these researches or auditors of these discoveries. They do well to keep themselves in their present situation; and instead of refining them into philosophers, I wish we cou'd communicate to our founders of systems, a share of this gross earthy mixture, as an ingredient, which they commonly stand much in need of, and which wou'd serve to temper those fiery particles, of which they are compos'd. While a warm imagination is allow'd to enter into philosophy, and hypotheses embrac'd merely for being specious and agreeable, we can never have any steady principles, nor any sentiments, which will suit with common practice and experience. But were these hypotheses once remov'd, we might hope to establish a system or set of opinions, which if not true (for that, perhaps, is too much to be hop'd for) might at least be satisfactory to the human mind, and might stand the test of the most critical examination. Nor shou'd we despair of attaining this end, because of the many chimerical systems, which have successively arisen and decay'd away among men, wou'd we consider the shortness of that period, wherein these questions have been the subjects of enquiry and reasoning. Two thousand years with such long interruptions, and under such mighty discouragements are a small space of time to give any tolerable perfection to the sciences; and perhaps we are still in too early an age of the world to discover any principles, which will bear the examination of the latest posterity. For my part, my only hope is, that I may contribute a little to the advancement of knowledge, by giving in some particulars a different turn to the speculations of philosophers, and pointing out to them more distinctly those subjects, where alone they can expect assurance and conviction. Human Nature is the only science of man; and yet has been hitherto the most neglected. 'Twill be sufficient for me, if I can bring it a little more into fashion; and the hope of this serves to compose my temper from that spleen, and invigorate it from that indolence, which sometimes prevail upon me. If the reader finds himself in the same easy disposition, let him follow me in my future speculations. If not, let him follow his inclination, and wait the returns of application and good humour. The conduct of a man, who studies philosophy in this careless manner, is more truly sceptical than that of one, who feeling in himself an inclination to it, is yet so over-whelm'd with doubts and scruples, as totally to reject it. A true sceptic will be diffident of his philosophical doubts, as well as of his philosophical conviction; and will never refuse any innocent satisfaction, which offers itself, upon account of either of them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' that connected succession of perceptions, which we call <i class="calibre10">self</i>, be always the object of these two passions, 'tis impossible it can be their cause, or be sufficient alone to excite them. For as these passions are directly contrary, and have the same object in common; were their object also their cause; it cou'd never produce any degree of the one passion, but at the same time it must excite an equal degree of the other; which opposition and contrariety must destroy both. 'Tis impossible a man can at the same time be both proud and humble; and where he has different reasons for these passions, as frequently happens, the passions either take place alternately; or if they encounter, the one annihilates the other, as far as its strength goes, and the remainder only of that, which is superior, continues to operate upon the mind. But in the present case neither of the passions cou'd ever become superior; because supposing it to be the view only of ourself, which excited them, that being perfectly indifferent to either, must produce both in the very same proportion; or in other words, can produce neither. To excite any passion, and at the same time raise an equal share of its antagonist, is immediately to undo what was done, and must leave the mind at last perfectly calm and indifferent.</p>

Pride and humility, being once rais'd, immediately turn our attention to ourself, and regard that as their ultimate and final object; but there is something farther requisite in order to raise them: Something, which is peculiar to one of the passions, and produces not both in the very same degree. The first idea, that is presented to the mind, is that of the cause or productive principle. This excites the passion, connected with it; and that passion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of self Here then is a passion plac'd betwixt two ideas, of which the one produces it, and the other is produc'd by it. The first idea, therefore, represents the <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, the second the <i class="calibre10">object</i> of the passion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the causes of pride and humility; we may observe, that their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of subjects, on which they may be plac'd. Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the causes of pride; and their opposites of humility. Nor are these passions confin'd to the mind, but extend their view to the body likewise. A man may be proud of his beauty, strength, agility, good mein, address in dancing, riding, fencing, and of his dexterity in any manual business or manufacture. But this is not all. The passion looking farther, comprehend whatever objects are in the least ally'd or related to us. Our country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, cloaths; any of these may become a cause either of pride or of humility.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">From the consideration of these causes, it appears necessary we shou'd make a new distinction in the causes of the passion, betwixt that <i class="calibre10">quality</i>, which operates, and the <i class="calibre10">subject</i>, on which it is plac'd. A man, for instance, is vain of a beautiful house, which belongs to him, or which he has himself built and contriv'd. Here the object of the passion is himself, and the cause is the beautiful house: Which cause again is sub-divided into two parts, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the quality, which operates upon the passion, and the subject, in which the quality inheres. The quality is the beauty, and the subject is the house, consider'd as his property or contrivance. Both these parts are essential, nor is the distinction vain and chimerical. Beauty, consider'd merely as such, unless plac'd upon something related to us, never produces any pride or vanity; and the strongest relation alone, without beauty, or something else in its place, has as little influence on that passion. Since, therefore, these two particulars are easily separated, and there is a necessity for their conjunction, in order to produce the passion, we ought to consider them as component parts of the cause; and infix in our minds an exact idea of this distinction.</p>

If there be any variation in this particular, it proceeds from nothing but a difference in the tempers and complexions of men; and is besides very inconsiderable.

Beside their prodigious number, many of them are the effects of art, and arise partly from the industry, partly from the caprice, and partly from the good fortune of men. Industry produces houses, furniture, cloaths. Caprice determines their particular kinds and qualities. And good fortune frequently contributes to all this, by discovering the effects that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies. 'Tis absurd, therefore, to imagine, that each of these was foreseen and provided for by nature, and that every new production of art, which causes pride or humility; instead of adapting itself to the passion by partaking of some general quality, that naturally operates on the mind; is itself the object of an original principle, which till then lay conceal'd in the soul, and is only by accident at last brought to light. Thus the first mechanic, that invented a fine scritoire, produc'd pride in him, who became possest of it, by principles different from those, which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables. As this appears evidently ridiculous, we must conclude, that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality; but that there are some one or more circumstances common to all of them, on which their efficacy depends.</p>

The <i class="calibre10">first</i> of these is the association of ideas, which I have so often observ'd and explain'd. 'Tis impossible for the mind to fix itself steadily upon one idea for any considerable time; nor can it by its utmost efforts ever arrive at such a constancy. But however changeable our thoughts may be, they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes. The rule, by which they proceed, is to pass from one object to what is resembling, contiguous to, or produc'd by it. When one idea is present to the imagination, any other, united by these relations, naturally follows it, and enters with more facility by means of that introduction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">second</i> property I shall observe in the human mind is a like association of impressions. All resembling impressions are connected together, and no sooner one arises than the rest immediately follow. Grief and disappointment give rise to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again, till the whole circle be compleated. In like manner our temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throws itself into love, generosity, pity, courage, pride, and the other resembling affections. 'Tis difficult for the mind, when actuated by any passion, to confine itself to that passion alone, without any change or variation. Human nature is too inconstant to admit of any such regularity. Changeableness is essential to it. And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail? 'Tis evident, then, there is an attraction or association among impressions, as well as among ideas; tho' with this remarkable difference, that ideas are associated by resemblance, contiguity, and causation; and impressions only by resemblance.</p>

Thus a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much discompos'd and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred subjects of discontent, impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions; especially if he can discover these subjects in or near the person, who was the cause of his first passion. Those principles, which forward the transition of ideas, here concur with those, which operate on the passions; and both uniting in one action, bestow on the mind a double impulse. The new passion, therefore, must arise with so much greater violence, and the transition to it must be render'd so much more easy and natural.</p>

Thus any continu'd sound, as the music of binds, or a fall of waters, awakens every moment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to the several beauties of the place, that lie before him. Thus if there arises a fragrance of smells or perfumes, they heighten the pleasure of the imagination, and make even the colours and verdure of the landscape appear more agreeable; for the ideas of both senses recommend each other, and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately: As the different colours of a picture, when they are well disposed, set off one another, and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the situation.’ In this phænomenon we may remark the association both of impressions and ideas, as well as the mutual assistance they lend each other.</p>

That cause, which excites the passion, is related to the object, which nature has attributed to the passion; the sensation, which the cause separately produces, is related to the sensation of the passion: From this double relation of ideas and impressions, the passion is deriv'd. The one idea is easily converted into its cor-relative; and the one impression into that, which resembles and corresponds to it: With how much greater facility must this transition be made, where these movements mutually assist each other, and the mind receives a double impulse from the relations both of its impressions and ideas?</p>

These two circumstances are united in pride. The organs are so dispos'd as to produce the passion; and the passion, after its production, naturally produces a certain idea. All this needs no proof. 'Tis evident we never shou'd be possest of that passion, were there not a disposition of mind proper for it; and 'tis as evident, that the passion always turns our view to ourselves, and makes us think of our own qualities and circumstances.</p>

The palate must be excited by an external object, in order to produce any relish: But hunger arises internally, without the concurrence of any external object.

		<p class="block_6 en">The difficulty, then, is only to discover this cause, and find what it is that gives the first motion to pride, and sets those organs in action, which are naturally fitted to produce that emotion. Upon my consulting experience, in order to resolve this difficulty, I immediately find a hundred different causes, that produce pride; and upon examining these causes, I suppose, what at first I perceive to be probable, that all of them concur in two circumstances; which are, that of themselves they produce an impression, ally'd to the passion, and are plac'd on a subject, ally'd to the object of the passion. When I consider after this the nature of <i class="calibre10">relation</i>, and its effects both on the passions and ideas, I can no longer doubt, upon these suppositions, that 'tis the very principle, which gives rise to pride, and bestows motion on those organs, which being naturally dispos'd to produce that affection, require only a first impulse or beginning to their action. Any thing, that gives a pleasant sensation, and is related to self excites the passion of pride, which is also agreeable, and has self for its object.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">What I have said of pride is equally true of humility. The sensation of humility is uneasy, as that of pride is agreeable; for which reason the separate sensation, arising from the causes, must be revers'd, while the relation to self continues the same. Tho' pride and humility are directly contrary in their effects, and in their sensations, they have not withstanding the same object; so that 'tis requisite only to change the relation of impressions, without making any change upon that of ideas. Accordingly we find, that a beautiful house, belonging to ourselves, produces pride; and that the same house, still belonging to ourselves, produces humility, when by any accident its beauty is chang'd into deformity, and thereby the sensation of pleasure, which corresponded to pride, is transform'd into pain, which is related to humility. The double relation between the ideas and impressions subsists in both cases, and produces an easy transition from the one emotion to the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In a word, nature has bestow'd a kind of attraction on certain impressions and ideas, by which one of them, upon its appearance, naturally introduces its correlative. If these two attractions or associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object, they mutually assist each other, and the transition of the affections and of the imagination is made with the greatest ease and facility. When an idea produces an impression, related to an impression, which is connected with an idea, related to the first idea, these two impressions must be in a manner inseparable, nor will the one in any case be unattended with the other, 'Tis after this manner, that the particular causes of pride and humility are determin'd. The quality, which operates on the passion, produces separately an impression resembling it; the subject, to which the quality adheres, is related to self, the object of the passion: No wonder the whole cause, consisting of a quality and of a subject, does so unavoidably give rise to the passion.</p>

I have observ'd, that in all judgments of this kind, there is always a present impression, and a related idea; and that the present impression gives a vivacity to the fancy, and the relation conveys this vivacity, by an easy transition, to the related idea. Without the present impression, the attention is not fix'd, nor the spirits excited. Without the relation, this attention rests on its first object, and has no farther consequence. There is evidently a great analogy betwixt that hypothesis, and our present one of an impression and idea, that transfuse themselves into another impression and idea by means of their double relation: Which analogy must be allow'd to be no despicable proof of both hypotheses.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But before we proceed farther in this subject, and examine particularly all the causes of pride and humility, 'twill be proper to make some limitations to the general system, <i class="calibre10">that all agreeable objects, related to ourselves, by an association</i> of ideas and impressions, produce pride, and disagreeable ones, humility:<i class="calibre10"> And these limitations are deriv'd from the</i> very nature of the subject.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I. Suppose an agreeable object to acquire a relation to self; the first passion, that appears on this occasion, is joy; and this passion discovers itself upon a slighter relation than pride and vain-glory. We may feel joy upon being present at a feast, where our senses are regal'd with delicacies of every kind: But 'tis only the master of the feast, who, beside the same joy, has the additional passion of self-applause and vanity. 'Tis true, men sometimes boast of a great entertainment, at which they have only been present; and by so small a relation convert their pleasure into pride: But however, this must in general be own'd, that joy arises from a more inconsiderable relation than vanity, and that many things, which are too foreign to produce pride, are yet . able to give us a delight and pleasure. The reason of the difference may be explain'd thus. A relation is requisite to joy, in order to approach the object to us, and make it give us any satisfaction. But beside this, which is common to both passions, ’tis requisite to pride, in order to produce a transition from one passion to another, and convert the satisfaction into vanity. As it has a double task to perform, it must be endow'd with double force and energy. To which we may add, that where agreeable objects bear not a very close relation to ourselves, they commonly do to some other person; and this latter relation not only excels, but even diminishes, and sometimes destroys the former, as we shall see afterwards<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-438" id="calibre_link-173" title="49">49</a></sup>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Here then is the first limitation, we must make to our general position, <i class="calibre10">that every thing related to us, which produces pleasure or pain, produces likewise pride or humility.</i> There is not only a relation requir'd, but a close one, and a closer than is requir'd to joy.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">II. The second limitation is, that the agreeable or disagreeable object be not only closely related, but also peculiar to ourselves, or at least common to us with a few persons. ’Tis a quality observable in human nature, and which we shall endeavour to explain afterwards, that everything, which is often presented, and to which we have been long accustom'd, loses its value in our eyes, and is in a little time despis'd and neglected. We likewise judge of objects more from comparison than from their real and intrinsic merit; and where we cannot by some contrast enhance their value, we are apt to overlook even what is essentially good in them. These qualities of the mind have an effect upon joy as well as pride; and 'tis remarkable, that goods, which are common to all mankind, and have become familiar to us by custom, give us little satisfaction; tho' perhaps of a more excellent kind, than those on which, for their singularity, we set a much higher value. But, tho' this circumstance operates on both these passions, it has a much greater influence on vanity. We are rejoic'd for many goods, which, on account of their frequency, give us no pride. Health, when it returns after a long absence, affords us a very sensible satisfaction; but is seldom regarded as a subject of vanity, because 'tis shar'd with such vast numbers.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The reason, why pride is so much more delicate in this particular than joy, I take to be, as follows. In order to excite pride, there are always two objects we must contemplate, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">cause</i> or that object which produces pleasure; and self, which is the real object of the passion. But joy has only one object necessary to its production, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that which gives pleasure; and tho' it be requisite, that this bear some relation to self; yet that is only requisite in order to render it agreeable; nor is self properly speaking, the object of this passion. Since, therefore, pride has in a manner two objects, to which it directs our view; it follows, that where neither of them have any singularity, the passion must be more weaken'd upon that account, than a passion, which has only one object. Upon comparing ourselves with others, as we are every moment apt to do, we find we are not in the least distinguish'd; and upon comparing the object we possess, we discover still the same unlucky circumstance. By two comparisons so disadvantageous the passion must be entirely destroy'd.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">III. The third limitation is, that the pleasant or painful object be very discernible and obvious, and that not only to ourselves, but to others also. This circumstance, like the two foregoing, has an effect upon joy, as well as pride. We fancy ourselves more happy, as well as more virtuous or beautiful, when we appear so to others; but are still more ostentatious of our virtues than of our pleasures. This proceeds from causes, which I shall endeavour to explain afterwards.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">IV. The fourth limitation is deriv'd from the inconstancy of the cause of these passions, and from the short duration of connexion with ourselves. What is casual and inconstant but little joy, and less pride. We are not much satisfy'd with the thing itself; and are still less apt to feel any new degrees of self-satisfaction upon its account. We foresee and anticipate its change by the imagination; which makes us little satisfy'd with the thing: We compare it to ourselves, whose existence is more durable; by which means its inconstancy appears still greater. It seems ridiculous to infer an excellency in ourselves from an object, which is of so much shorter duration, and attends us during so small a part of our existence. 'Twill be easy to comprehend the reason, why this cause operates not with the same force in joy as in pride; since the idea of self is not so essential to the former passion as to the latter.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">V. I may add as a fifth limitation, or rather enlargement of this system, that <i class="calibre10">general rules</i> have a great influence upon pride and humility, as well as on all the other passions. Hence we form a notion of different ranks of men, suitable to the power or riches they are possest of; and this notion we change not upon account of any peculiarities of the health or temper of the persons, which may deprive them of all enjoyment in their possessions. This may be accounted for from the same principles, that explain'd the influence of general rules on the understanding. Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds in our passions, as well as in our reasonings.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be amiss to observe on this occasion, that the influence of general rules and maxims on the passions very much contributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles, which we shall explain in the progress of this treatise. For ’tis evident, that if a person full-grown, and of the same nature with ourselves, were on a sudden transported into our world, he wou'd be very much embarrass'd with every object, and wou'd not readily find what degree of love or hatred, pride or humility, or any other passion he ought to attribute to it. The passions are often vary'd by very inconsiderable principles; and these do not always play with a perfect regularity, especially on the first trial. But as custom and practice have brought to light all these principles, and have settled the just value of every thing; this must certainly contribute to the easy production of the passions, and guide us, by means of general establish'd maxims, in the proportions we ought to observe in preferring one object to another. This remark may, perhaps, serve to obviate difficulties, that may arise concerning some causes, which I shall hereafter ascribe to particular passions, and which may be esteem'd too refin'd to operate so universally and certainly, as they are found to do.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I shall close this subject with a reflection deriv'd from these five limitations. This reflection is, that the persons, who are proudest, and who in the eye of the world have most reason for their pride, are not always the happiest; nor the most humble always the most miserable, as may at first sight be imagin'd from this system. An evil may be real, tho' its cause has no relation to us: It may be real, without being peculiar: It may be real, without shewing itself to others: It may be real, without being constant: And it may be real, without falling under the general rules. Such evils as these will not fail to render us miserable, tho' they have little tendency to diminish pride: And perhaps the most real and the most solid evils of life will be found of this nature.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">For granting that morality had no foundation in nature, it must still be allow'd, that vice and virtue, either from self interest or the prejudices of education, produce in us a real pain and pleasure; and this we may observe to be strenuously asserted by the defenders of that hypothesis. Every passion, habit, or turn of character (say they) which has a tendency to our advantage or prejudice, gives a delight or uneasiness; and 'tis from thence the approbation or disapprobation arises. We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack: justice is the support of society, but injustice, unless check'd, wou'd quickly prove its ruin: Humility exalts; but pride mortifies us. For these reasons the former qualities are esteem'd virtues, and the latter regarded as vices. Now since 'tis granted there is a delight or uneasiness still attending merit or demerit of every kind, this is all that is requisite for my purpose.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But I go farther, and observe, that this moral hypothesis and my present system not only agree together, but also that, allowing the former to be just, 'tis an absolute and invincible proof of the latter. For if all morality be founded on the pain or pleasure, which arises from the prospect of any loss or advantage, that may result from our own characters, or from those of others, all the effects of morality must be deriv'd from the same pain or pleasure, and among the rest, the passions of pride and humility. The very essence of virtue, according to this hypothesis, is to produce pleasure, and that of vice to give pain. The virtue and vice must be part of our character in order to excite pride or humility. What farther proof can we desire for the double relation of impressions and ideas?</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The same unquestionable argument may be deriv'd from the opinion of those, who maintain that morality is something real, essential, and founded on nature. The most probable hypothesis, which has been advanc'd to explain the distinction betwixt vice and virtue, and the origin of moral rights and obligations, is, that from a primary constitution of nature certain characters and passions, by the very view and contemplation, produce a pain, and others in like manner excite a pleasure. The uneasiness and satisfaction are not only inseparable from vice and virtue, but constitute their very nature and essence. To approve of a character is to feel an original delight upon its appearance. To disapprove of it is to be sensible of an uneasiness. The pain and pleasure, therefore, being the primary causes of vice and virtue, must also be the causes of all their effects, and consequently of pride and humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of that distinction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But supposing this hypothesis of moral philosophy shou'd be allow'd to be false, 'tis still evident, that pain and pleasure, if not the causes of vice and virtue, are at least inseparable from them. A generous and noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey; and when presented to us, tho only in a poem or fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the other hand cruelty and treachery displease from their very nature; nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to these qualities, either in ourselves or others.

Nothing flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleasing by our wit, good humour, or any other accomplishment; and nothing gives us a more sensible mortification than a disappointment in any attempt of that nature. No one has ever been able to tell what <i class="calibre10">wit</i> is, and to shew why such a system of thought must be receiv'd under that denomination, and such another rejected. 'Tis only by taste we can decide concerning it, nor are we possest of any other standard, upon which we can form a judgment of this kind. Now what is this taste, from which true and false wit in a manner receive their being, and without which no thought can have a title to either of these denominations? 'Tis plainly nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true wit, and of uneasiness from false, without our being able to tell the reasons of that pleasure or uneasiness. The power of bestowing these opposite sensations is, therefore, the very essence of true and false wit; and consequently the cause of that pride or humility, which arises from them.</p>

Wherever, therefore, we can find the other relation of impressions to join to this of ideas, we may expect with assurance either of these passions, according as the impression is pleasant or uneasy. But <i class="calibre10">beauty</i> of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight and satisfaction; as <i class="calibre10">deformity</i> produces pain, upon whatever subject it may be plac'd, and whether survey'd in an animate or inanimate object. If the beauty or deformity, therefore, be plac'd upon our own bodies, this pleasure or uneasiness must be converted into pride or humility, as having in this case all the circumstances requisite to produce a perfect transition of impressions and ideas. These opposite sensations are related to the opposite passions. The beauty or deformity is closely related to self, the object of both these passions. No wonder, then our own beauty becomes an object of pride, and deformity of humility.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But this effect of personal and bodily qualities is not only a proof of the present system, by showing that the passions arise not in this case without all the circumstances I have requir'd, but may be empley'd as a stronger and more convincing argument. If we consider all the hypotheses, which have been form'd either by philosophy or common reason, to explain the difference betwixt beauty and deformity, we shall find that all of them resolve into this, that beauty is such an order and construction of parts, as either by the <i class="calibre10">primary constitution</i> of our nature, by <i class="calibre10">custom</i>, or by <i class="calibre10">caprice</i>, is fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul. This is the distinguishing character of beauty, and forms all the difference betwixt it and deformity, whose natural tendency is to produce uneasiness. Pleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary attendants of beauty and deformity, but constitute their very essence. And indeed, if we consider, that a great part of the beauty, which we admire either in animals or in other objects, is deriv'd from the idea of convenience and utility, we shall make no scruple to assent to this opinion. That shape, which produces strength, is beautiful in one animal; and that which is a sign of agility in another. The order and convenience of a palace are no less essential to its beauty, than its mere figure and appearance. In like manner the rules of architecture require, that the top of a pillar shou'd be more slender than its base, and that because such a figure conveys to us the idea of security, which is pleasant; whereas the contrary form gives us the apprehension of danger, which is uneasy. From innumerable instances of this kind, as well as from considering that beauty like wit, cannot be defin'd, but is discern'd only by a taste or sensation, we may conclude, that beauty is nothing but a form, which produces pleasure, as deformity is a structure of parts, which conveys pain; and since the power of producing pain and pleasure make in this manner the essence of beauty and deformity, all the effects of these qualities must be deriv'd from the sensation; and among the rest pride and humility, which of all their effects are the most common and remarkable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This argument I esteem just and decisive; but in order to give greater authority to the present reasoning, let us suppose it false for a moment, and see what will follow. ’Tis certain, then, that if the power of producing pleasure and pain forms not the essence of beauty and deformity, the sensations are at least inseparable from the qualities, and 'tis even difficult to consider them apart. Now there is nothing common to natural and moral beauty, (both of which are the causes of pride) but this power of producing pleasure; and as a common effect supposes always a common cause, 'tis plain the pleasure must in both cases be the real and influencing cause of the passion. Again; there is nothing originally different betwixt the beauty of our bodies and the beauty of external and foreign objects, but that the one has a near relation to ourselves, which is wanting in the other. This original difference, therefore, must be the cause of all their other differences, and among the rest, of their different influence upon the passion of pride, which is excited by the beauty of our person, but is not affected in the least by that of foreign and external objects. Placing, then, these two conclusions together, we find they compose the preceding system betwixt them, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that pleasure, as a related or resembling impression, when plac'd on a related object, by a natural transition, produces pride; and its contrary, humility. This system, then, seems already sufficiently confirm'd by experience; tho' we have not yet exhausted all our arguments. ’Tis not the beauty of the body alone that produces pride, but also its strength and force. Strength is a kind of power; and therefore the desire to excel in strength is to be consider'd as an inferior species of <i class="calibre10">ambition</i>. For this reason the present phenomenon will be sufficiently accounted for, in explaining that passion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Tho' it shou'd be question'd, whether beauty be not something real, and different from the power of producing pleasure, it can never be disputed, that as surprize is nothing but a pleasure arising from novelty, it is not, properly speaking, a quality in any object, but merely a passion or impression in the soul. It must, therefore, be from that impression, that pride by a natural transition arises. And it arises so naturally, that there is nothing <i class="calibre10">in us or belonging to us</i>, which produces surprize, that does not at the same time excite that other passion. Thus we are vain of the surprising adventures we have met with, the escapes we have made, and dangers we have been expos'd to. Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men without any interest, and merely out of vanity, heap up a number of extraordinary events, which are either the fictions of their brain, or if true, have at least no connexion with themselves. Their fruitful invention supplies them with a variety of adventures; and where that talent is wanting, they appropriate such as belong to others, in order to satisfy their vanity.</p>

By one of these experiments we find, that an object produces pride merely by the interposition of pleasure; and that because the quality, by which it produces pride, is in reality nothing but the power of producing pleasure. By the other experiment we find, that the pleasure produces the pride by a transition along related ideas; because when we cut off that relation the passion is immediately destroy'd. A surprising adventure, in which we have been ourselves engag'd, is related to us, and by that means produces pride: But the adventures of others, tho' they may cause pleasure, yet for want of this relation of ideas, never excite that passion.

		<p class="block_6 en">There is only one objection to this system with regard to our body; which is, that tho' nothing be more agreeable than health, and more painful than sickness, yet commonly men are neither proud of the one, nor mortify'd with the other. This will easily be accounted for, if we consider the <i class="calibre10">second</i> and <i class="calibre10">fourth</i> limitations, propos'd to our general system. It was observ'd, that no object ever produces pride or humility, if it has not something <i class="calibre10">peculiar</i> to ourself; as also, that every cause of that passion must be in some measure constant, and hold some proportion to the duration of ourself, which is its object. Now as health and sickness vary incessantly to all men, and there is none, who is <i class="calibre10">solely</i> or <i class="calibre10">certainly</i> fix'd in either, these accidental blessings and calamities are in a manner separated from us, and are never consider'd as connected with our being and existence. And that this account is just appears hence, that wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our constitution, that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery, from that moment it becomes an object of humility; as is evident in old men, whom nothing mortifies more than the consideration of their age and infirmities. They endeavour, as long as possible, to conceal their blindness and deafness, their rheums and gouts; nor do they ever confess them without reluctance and uneasiness. And tho' young men are not asham'd of every head-ach or cold they fall into, yet no topic is so proper to mortify human pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature, than this, that we are every moment of our lives subject to such infirmities. This sufficiently proves that bodily pain and sickness are in themselves proper causes of humility; tho' the custom of estimating every thing by comparison more than by its intrinsic worth and value, makes us overlook these calamities, which we find to be incident to every one, and causes us to form an idea of our merit and character independent of them.</p>

We found a vanity upon houses, gardens, equipages, as well as upon personal merit and accomplishments; and tho' these external advantages be in themselves widely distant from thought or a person, yet they considerably influence even a passion, which is directed to that as its ultimate object. This happens when external objects acquire any particular relation to ourselves, and are associated or connected with us. A beautiful fish in the ocean, an animal in a desart, and indeed any thing that neither belongs, nor is related to us, has no manner of influence on our vanity, whatever extraordinary qualities it may be endow'd with, and whatever degree of surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion. It must be some way associated with us in order to touch our pride. Its idea must hang in a manner, upon that of ourselves; and the transition from the one to the other must be easy and natural.</p>

If we resemble a person in any of the valuable parts of his character, we must, in some degree, possess the quality, in which we resemble him; and this quality we always chuse to survey directly in ourselves rather than by redexion in another person, when we wou'd found upon it any degree of vanity.

		<p class="block_6 en">There are instances, indeed, wherein men shew a vanity in resembling a great man in his countenance, shape, air, or other minute circumstances, that contribute not in any degree to his reputation; but it must be confess'd, that this extends not very far, nor is of any considerable moment in these affections. For this I assign the following reason. We can never have a vanity of resembling in triffles any person, unless he be possess'd of very shining qualities, which give us a respect and veneration for him. These qualities, then, are, properly speaking, the causes of our vanity, by means of their relation to ourselves. Now after what manner are they related to ourselves? They are parts of the person we value, and consequently connected with these triffles; which are also suppos'd to be parts of him. These triffles are connected with the resembling qualities in us; and these qualities in us, being parts, are connected with the whole; and by that means form a chain of several links betwixt ourselves and the shining qualities of the person we resemble. But besides that this multitude of relations must weaken the connexion; ’tis evident the mind, in passing from the shining qualities to the trivial ones, must by that contrast the better perceive the minuteness of the latter, and be in some measure asham'd of the comparison and resemblance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The relation, therefore, of contiguity, or that of causation, betwixt the cause and object of pride and humility, is alone requisite to give rise to these passions; and these relations are nothing else but qualities, by which the imagination is convey'd from one idea to another. Now let us consider what effect these can possibly have upon the mind, and by what means they become so requisite to the production of the passions. 'Tis evident, that the association of ideas operates in so silent and imperceptible a manner, that we are scarce sensible of it, and discover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or perception. It produces no emotion, and gives rise to no new impression of any kind, but only modifies those ideas, of which the mind was formerly possess'd, and which it cou'd recal upon occasion. From this reasoning, as well as from undoubted experience, we may conclude, that an association of ideas, however necessary, is not alone sufficient to give rise to any passion.</p>

<div class="bottom">

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, then, that when the mind feels the passion either of pride or humility upon the appearance of a related object, there is, beside the relation or transition of thought, an emotion or original impression produc'd by some other principle. The question is, whether the emotion first produc'd be the passion itself, or some other impression related to it. This question we cannot be long in deciding. For besides all the other arguments, with which this subject abounds, it must evidently appear, that the relation of ideas, which experience shews to be so requisite a circumstance to the production of the passion, wou'd be entirely superfluous, were it not to second a relation of affections, and facilitate the transition from one impression to another. If nature produc'd immediately the passion of pride or humility, it wou'd be compleated in itself, and wou'd require no farther addition or encrease from any other affection. But supposing the first emotion to be only related to pride or humility, 'tis easily conceiv'd to what purpose the relation of objects may serve, and how the two different associations, of impressions and ideas, by uniting their forces, may assist each other's operation. This is not only easily conceiv'd, but I will venture to affirm 'tis the only manner, in which we can conceive this subject. An easy transition of ideas, which, of itself; causes no emotion, can never be necessary, or even useful to the passions, but by forwarding the transition betwixt some related impressions. Not to mention, that the same object causes a greater or smaller degree of pride, not only in proportion to the encrease or decrease of its qualities, but also to the distance or nearness of the relation; which is a clear argument for the transition of affections along the relation of ideas; since every change in the relation produces a proportion able change in the passion. Thus one part of the preceding system, concerning the relations of ideas is a sufficient proof of the other, concerning that of impressions; and is itself so evidently founded on experience, that 'twou'd be lost time to endeavour farther to prove it.</p>

Since therefore the passion depends on these relations, whatever strengthens any of the relations must also encrease the passion, and whatever weakens the relations must diminish the passion. Now 'tis certain the identity of the possession strengthens the relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred, and conveys the fancy with greater facility from one generation to another, from the remotest ancestors to their posterity, who are both their heirs and their descendants.

'Tis a quality of human nature, which we shall consider <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-298" id="calibre_link-150" title="50">50</a></sup>afterwards, that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is important and considerable; and where two objects are presented to it, a small and a great one, usually leaves the former, and dwells entirely upon the latter. As in the society of marriage, the male sex has the advantage above the female, the husband first engages our attention; and whether we consider him directly, or reach him by passing thro' related objects, the thought both rests upon him with greater satisfaction, and arrives at him with greater facility than his consort. 'Tis easy to see, that this property must strengthen the child's relation to the father, and weaken that to the mother. For as all relations are nothing but a propensity to pass from one idea to another, whatever strengthens the propensity strengthens the relation; and as we have a stronger propensity to pass from the idea of the children to that of the father, than from the same idea to that of the mother, we ought to regard the former relation as the closer and more considerable. This is the reason why children commonly bear their father's name, and are esteem'd to be of nobler or baser birth, according to <i class="calibre10">his</i> family. And tho' the mother shou'd be possest of a superior spirit and genius to the father, as often happens, the <i class="calibre10">general rule</i> prevails, notwithstanding the exception, according to the doctrine above-explain'd. Nay even when a superiority of any kind is so great, or when any other reasons have such an effect, as to make the children rather represent the mother's family than the father's, the general rule still retains such an efficacy that it weakens the relation, and makes a kind of break in the line of ancestors. The imagination runs not along them with facility, nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ancestors to their posterity of the same name and family so readily, as when the transition is conformable to the general rules, and passes from father to son, or from brother to brother.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident the error of distinguishing power from its exercise proceeds not entirely from the scholastic doctrine of free-will, which, indeed, enters very little into common life, and has but small influence on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking. According to that doctrine, motives deprive us not of free-will, nor take away our power of performing or forbearing any action. But according to common notions a man has no power, where very considerable motives lie betwixt him and the satisfaction of his desires, and determine him to forbear what he wishes to perform. I do not think I have fallen into my enemies power, when I see him pass me in the streets with a sword by his side, while I am unprovided of any weapon. I know that the fear of the civil magistrate is as strong a restraint as any of iron, and that I am in as perfect safety as if he were chain'd or imprison'd. But when a person acquires such an authority over me, that not only there is no external obstacle to his actions; but also that he may punish or reward me as he pleases, without any dread of punishment in his turn, I then attribute a full power to him, and consider myself as his subject or vassal.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now if we compare these two cases, that of a person, who has very strong motives of interest or safety to forbear any action, and that of another, who lies under no such obligation, we shall find, according to the philosophy explain'd in the foregoing book, that the only <i class="calibre10">known</i> difference betwixt them lies in this, that in the former case we conclude from <i class="calibre10">past experience</i>, that the person never will perform that action, and in the latter, that he possibly or probably will perform it. Nothing is more fluctuating and inconstant on many occasions, than the will of man; nor is there any thing but strong motives, which can give us an absolute certainty in pronouncing concerning any of his future actions. When we see a person free from these motives, we suppose a possibility either of his acting or forbearing; and tho' in general we may conclude him to be determin'd by motives and causes, yet this removes not the uncertainty of our judgment concerning these causes, nor the influence of that uncertainty on the passions. Since therefore we ascribe a power of performing an action to every one, who has no very powerful motive to forbear it, and refuse it to such as have; it may justly be concluded, that <i class="calibre10">power</i> has always a reference to its <i class="calibre10">exercise</i>, either actual or probable, and that we consider a person as endow'd with any ability when we find from past experience, that 'tis probable, or at least possible he may exert it. And indeed, as our passions always regard the real existence of objects, and we always judge of this reality from past instances; nothing can be more likely of itself, without any farther reasoning, than that power consists in the possibility or probability of any action, as discover'd by experience and the practice of the world.</p>

The passions are not only affected by such events as are certain and infallible, but also in an inferior degree by such as are possible and contingent. And tho' perhaps I never really feel any harm, and discover by the event, that, philosophically speaking, the person never had any power of harming me; since he did not exert any; this prevents not my uneasiness from the preceding uncertainty. The agreeable passions may here operate as well as the uneasy, and convey a pleasure when I perceive a good to become either possible or probable by the possibility or probability of another's bestowing it on me, upon the removal of any strong motives, which might formerly have hinder'd him.</p>

As all men desire pleasure, nothing can be more probable, than its existence when there is no external obstacle to the producing it, and men perceive no danger in following their inclinations.

		<p class="block_6 en">No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. This is not only conspicuous in children, who implicitly embrace every opinion propos'd to them; but also in men of the greatest judgment and understanding, who find it very difficult to follow their own reason or inclination, in opposition to that of their friends and daily companions. To this principle we ought to ascribe the great uniformity we may observe in the humours and turn of thinking of those of the same nation; and 'tis much more probable, that this resemblance arises from sympathy, than from any influence of the soil and climate which tho' they continue invariably the same, are not able to preserve the character of a nation the same for a century together. A good-natur'd man finds himself in an instant of the same humour with his company; and even the proudest and most surly take a tincture from their countrymen and acquaintance. A chearful countenance infuses a sensible complacency and serenity into my mind; as an angry or sorrowful one throws a sudden damp upon me. Hatred, resentment, esteem, love, courage, mirth and melancholy; all these passions I feel more from communication than from my own natural temper and disposition. So remarkable a phænomenon merits our attention, and must be trac'd up to its first principles. When any affection is infus'd by sympathy, it is at first known only by its effects, and by those external signs in the countenance and conversation, which convey an idea of it. This idea is presently converted into an impression, and acquires such a degree of force and vivacity, as to become the very passion itself, and produce an equal emotion, as any original affection. However instantaneous this change of the idea into an impression may be, it proceeds from certain views and reflections, which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a philosopher, tho' they may the person himself, who makes them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Tis evident, that the idea, or rather impression of ourselves is always intimately present with us, and that our consciousness gives us so lively a conception of our own person, that ’tis not possible to imagine, that any thing can in this particular go beyond it. Whatever object, therefore, is related to ourselves must be conceived with a like vivacity of conception, according to the foregoing principles; and tho' this relation shou'd not be so strong as that of causation, it must still have a considerable influence. Resemblance and contiguity are relations not to be neglected; especially when by an inference from cause and effect, and by the observation of external signs, we are inform'd of the real existence of the object, which is resembling or contiguous.</p>

The case is the same with the fabric of the mind, as with that of the body. However the parts may differ in shape or size, their structure and composition are in general the same. There is a very remarkable resemblance, which preserves itself amidst all their variety; and this resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others, and embrace them with facility and pleasure. Accordingly we find, that where, beside the general resemblance of our natures, there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy. The stronger the relation is betwixt ourselves and any object, the more easily does the imagination make the transition, and convey to the related idea the vivacity of conception, with which we always form the idea of our own person.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been remark'd in the beginning of this treatise, that all ideas are borrow'd from impressions, and that these two kinds of perceptions differ only in the degrees of force and vivacity, with which they strike upon the soul. The component parts of ideas and impressions are precisely alike. The manner and order of their appearance may be the same. The different degrees of their force and vivacity are, therefore, the only particulars, that distinguish them: And as this difference may be remov'd, in some measure, by a relation betwixt the impressions and ideas, 'tis no wonder an idea of a sentiment or passion, may by this means be so inliven'd as to become the very sentiment or passion. The lively idea of any object always approaches its impression; and 'tis certain we may feel sickness and pain from the mere force of imagination, and make a malady real by often thinking of it. But this is most remarkable in the opinions and affections; and 'tis there principally that a lively idea is converted into an impression. Our affections depend more upon ourselves, and the internal operations of the mind, than any other impressions; for which reason they arise more naturally from the imagination, and from every lively idea we form of them. This is the nature and cause of sympathy; and 'tis after this manner we enter so deep into the opinions and affections of others, whenever we discover them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">What is principally remarkable in this whole affair is the strong confirmation these phænomena give to the foregoing system concerning the understanding, and consequently to the present one conceding the passions; since these are analogous to each other. 'Tis indeed evident, that when we sympathize with the passions and sentiments of others, these movements appear at first in <i class="calibre10">our</i> mind as mere ideas, and are conceiv'd to belong to another person, as we conceive any other matter of fact. 'Tis also evident, that the ideas of the affections of others are converted into the very impressions they represent, and that the passions arise in conformity to the images we form of them. All this is an object of the plainest experience, and depends not on any hypothesis of philosophy. That science can only be admitted to explain the phænomena; tho' at the same time it must be confest, they are so clear of themselves, that there is but little occasion to employ it. For besides the relation of cause and effect, by which we are convinc'd of the reality of the passion, with which we sympathize; besides this, I say, we must be assisted by the relations of resemblance and contiguity, in order to feel the sympathy in its full perfection. And since these relations can entirely convert an idea into an impression, and convey the vivacity of the latter into the former, so perfectly as to lose nothing of it in the transition, we may easily conceive how the relation of cause and effect alone, may serve to strengthen and inliven an idea. In sympathy there is an evident conversion of an idea into an impression. This conversion arises from the relation of objects to ourself. Ourself is always intimately present to us. Let us compare all these circumstances, and we shall find, that sympathy is exactly correspondent to the operations of our understanding; and even contains something more surprising and extraordinary. ’Tis now time to turn our view from the general consideration of sympathy, to its influence on pride and humility, when these passions arise from praise and blame, from reputation and infamy. We may observe, that no person is ever prais'd by another for any quality, which wou'd not, if real, produce, of itself, a pride in the person possest of it. The elogiums either turn upon his power, or riches, or family, or virtue; all of which are subjects of vanity, that we have already explain'd and accounted for. 'Tis certain, then, that if a person consider'd himself in the same light, in which he appears to his admirer, he wou'd first receive a separate pleasure, and afterwards a pride or self-satisfaction, according to the hypothesis above explain'd. Now nothing is more natural than for us to embrace the opinions of others in this particular; both from <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>, which renders all their sentiments intimately present to us; and from <i class="calibre10">reasoning</i>, which makes us regard their judgment, as a kind of argument for what they affirm. These two principles of authority and sympathy influence almost all our opinions; but must have a peculiar influence, when we judge of our own worth and character. Such judgments are always attended with passion<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-422" id="calibre_link-436" title="53">53</a></sup>; and nothing tends more to disturb our understanding, and precipitate us into any opinions, however unreasonable, than their connexion with passion; which diffuses itself over the imagination, and gives an additional force to every related idea. To which we may add, that being conscious of great partiality in our own favour, we are peculiarly pleas'd with any thing, that confirms the good opinion we have of ourselves, and are easily shock'd with whatever opposes it.</p>

Every thing in this world is judg'd of by comparison. What is an immense fortune for a private gentleman is beggary for a prince. A peasant wou'd think himself happy in what cannot afford necessaries for a gentleman. When a man has either been accustom'd to a more splendid way of living, or thinks himself intitled to it by his birth and quality, every thing below is disagreeable and even shameful; and 'tis with the greatest industry he conceals his pretensions to a better fortune. Here he himself knows his misfortunes; but as those, with whom he lives, are ignorant of them, he has the disagreeable reflection and comparison suggested only by his own thoughts, and never receives it by a sympathy with others; which must contribute very much to his ease and satisfaction.</p>

Popular fame may be agreeable even to a man, who despises the vulgar; but 'tis because their multitude gives them additional weight and authority. Plagiaries are delighted with praises, which they are conscious they do not deserve; but this is a kind of castle-building, where the imagination amuses itself with its own fictions, and strives to render them firm and stable by a sympathy with the sentiments of others. Proud men are most shock'd with contempt, tho' they do not most readily assent to it; but 'tis because of the opposition betwixt the passion, which is natural to them, and that receiv'd by sympathy. A violent lover in like manner is very much displeas'd when you blame and condemn his love; tho' 'tis evident your opposition can have no influence, but by the hold it takes of himself, and by his sympathy with you. If he despises you, or perceives you are in jest, whatever you say has no effect upon him.</p>

We have not only prov'd, that a tendency to produce pleasure or pain is common to all the causes of pride or humility, but also that 'tis the only thing, which is common; and consequently is the quality, by which they operate. We have farther prov'd, that the most considerable causes of these passions are really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or uneasy sensations; and therefore that all their effects, and amongst the rest, pride and humility, are deriv'd solely from that origin.

'Tis indeed certain, that where the structure of parts in brutes is the same as in men, and the operation of these parts also the same, the causes of that operation cannot be different, and that whatever we discover to be true of the one species, may be concluded without hesitation to be certain of the other. Thus tho' the mixture of humours and the composition of minute parts may justly be presum'd to be somewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals; and therefore any experiment we make upon the one concerning the effects of medicines will not always apply to the other; yet as the structure of the veins and muscles, the fabric and situation of the heart, of the lungs, the stomach, the liver and other parts, are the same or nearly the same in all animals, the very same hypothesis, which in one species explains muscular motion, the progress of the chyle, the circulation of the blood, must be applicable to every one; and according as it agrees or disagrees with the experiments we may make in any species of creatures, we may draw a proof of its truth or falshood on the whole. Let us, therefore, apply this method of enquiry, which is found so just and useful in reasonings concerning the body, to our present anatomy of the mind, and see what discoveries we can make by it. In order to this we must first shew the correspondence of <i class="calibre10">passions</i> in men and animals, and afterwards compare the causes, which produce these passions.</p>

The very port and gait of a swan, or turkey, or peacock show the high idea he has entertain'd of himself; and his contempt of all others. This is the more remarkable, that in the two last species of animals, the pride always attends the beauty, and is discover'd in the male only. The vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing have been commonly remark'd; as likewise that of horses in swiftness, of hounds in sagacity and smell, of the bull and cock in strength, and of every other animal in his particular excellency. Add to this, that every species of creatures, which approach so often to man, as to familiarize themselves with him, show an evident pride in his approbation, and are pleas'd with his praises and caresses, independent of every other consideration. Nor are they the caresses of every one without distinction, which give them this vanity, but those principally of the persons they know and love; in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind. All these are evident proofs, that pride and humility are not merely human passions, but extend themselves over the whole animal creation.</p>

In like manner, when he has been heartily beat in any place, he will tremble on his approach to it, even tho' he discover no signs of any present danger. The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable; but as that relation makes a considerable ingredient in causation, of which all animals shew so evident a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation operate in the same manner upon beasts as upon human creatures.</p>

A dog, when elevated with joy, runs naturally into love and kindness, whether of his master or of the sex.

For besides, that a relation of ideas operates secretly and calmly on the mind, it bestows an equal impulse towards the opposite passions of pride and humility, love and hatred, according as the object belongs to ourselves or others; which opposition of the passions must destroy both, and leave the mind perfectly free from any affection or emotion. This reasoning <i class="calibre10">a priori</i> is confirmed by experience.

		<p class="block_6 en">Third Experiment. 'Tis evident, therefore, that a relation of ideas is not able alone to give rise to these affections. Let us now remove this relation, and in its stead place a relation of impressions, by presenting an object, which is agreeable or disagreeable, but has no relation either to ourself or companion; and let us observe the consequences. To consider the matter first <i class="calibre10">a priori</i>, as in the preceding experiment; we may conclude, that the object will have a small, but an uncertain connexion with these passions. For besides, that this relation is not a cold and imperceptible one, it has not the inconvenience of the relation of ideas, nor directs us with equal force to two contrary passions, which by their opposition destroy each other. But if we consider, on the other hand, that this transition from the sensation to the affection is not forwarded by any principle, that produces a transition of ideas; but, on the contrary, that tho' the one impression be easily transfus'd into the other, yet the change of objects is suppos'd contrary to all the principles, that cause a transition of that kind; we may from thence infer, that nothing will ever be a steady or durable cause of any passion, that is connected with the passion merely by a relation of impressions. What our reason wou'd conclude from analogy, after balancing these arguments, wou'd be, that an object, which produces pleasure or uneasiness, but has no manner of connexion either with ourselves or others, may give such a turn to the disposition, as that it may naturally fall into pride or love, humility or hatred, and search for other objects, upon which, by a double relation, it can found these affections; but that an object, which has only one of these relations, tho' the most advantageous one, can never give rise to any constant and establish'd passion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Most fortunately all this reasoning is found to be exactly conformable to experience, and the phenomena of the passions. Suppose I were travelling with a companion thro' a country, to which we are both utter strangers; 'tis evident, that if the prospects be beautiful, the roads agreeable, and the inns commodious, this may put me into good humour both with myself and fellow-traveller. But as we suppose, that this country has no relation either to myself or friend, it can never be the immediate cause of pride or love; and therefore if I found not the passion on some other object, that bears either of us a closer relation, my emotions are rather to be consider'd as the overflowings of an elevate or humane disposition, than as an establish'd passion. The case is the same where the object produces uneasiness.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Fourth Experiment. Having found, that neither an object without any relation of ideas or impressions, nor an object, that has only one relation, can ever cause pride or humility, love or hatred; reason alone may convince us, without any farther experiment, that whatever has a double relation must necessarily excite these passions; since 'tis evident they must have some cause. But to leave as little room for doubt as possible, let us renew our experiments, and see whether the event in this case answers our expectation. I choose an object, such as virtue, that causes a separate satisfaction: On this object I bestow a relation to self; and find, that from this disposition of affairs, there immediately arises a passion. But what passion? That very one of pride, to which this object bears a double relation. Its idea is related to that of self; the object of the passion: The sensation it causes resembles the sensation of the passion. That I may be sure I am not mistaken in this experiment, I remove first one relation; then another; and find, that each removal destroys the passion, and leaves the object perfectly indifferent. But I am not content with this. I make a still farther trial; and instead of removing the relation, I only change it for one of a different kind. I suppose the virtue to belong to my companion, not to myself; and observe what follows from this alteration. I immediately perceive the affections to wheel about, and leaving pride, where there is only one relation, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> of impressions, fall to the side of love, where they are attracted by a double relation of impressions and ideas. By repeating the same experiment, in changing anew the relation of ideas, I bring the affections back to pride; and by a new repetition I again place them at love or kindness. Being fully convinc'd of the influence of this relation, I try the effects of the other; and by changing virtue for vice, convert the pleasant impression, which arises from the former, into the disagreeable one, which proceeds from the latter. The effect still answers expectation. Vice, when plac'd on another, excites, by means of its double relations, the passion of hatred, instead of love, which for the same reason arises from virtue. To continue the experiment, I change anew the relation of ideas, and suppose the vice to belong to myself. What follows? What is usual. A subsequent change of the passion from hatred to humility. This humility I convert into pride by a new change of the impression; and find after all that I have compleated the round, and have by these changes brought back the passion to that very situation, in which I first found it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But to make the matter still more certain, I alter the object; and instead of vice and virtue, make the trial upon beauty and deformity, riches and poverty, power and servitude. Each of these objects runs the circle of the passions in the same manner, by a change of their relations: And in whatever order we proceed, whether thro' pride, love, hatred, humility, or thro' humility, hatred, love, pride, the experiment is not in the least diversify'd. Esteem and contempt, indeed, arise on some occasions instead of love and hatred; but these are at the bottom the same passions, only diversify'd by some causes, which we shall explain afterwards.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Fifth Experiment. To give greater authority to these experiments, let us change the situation of affairs as much as possible, and place the passions and objects in all the different positions, of which they are susceptible. Let us suppose, beside the relations above-mention'd, that the person, along with whom I make all these experiments, is closely connected with me either by blood or friendship. He is, we shall suppose, my son or brother, or is united to me by a long and familiar acquaintance.

		<p class="block_6 en">Before we consider what they are in fact, let us determine what they ought to be, conformable to my hypothesis. 'Tis plain, that, according as the impression is either pleasant or uneasy, the passion of love or hatred must arise towards the person, who is thus connected to the cause of the impression by these double relations, which I have all along requir'd. The virtue of a brother must make me love him; as his vice or infamy must excite the contrary passion. But to judge only from the situation of affairs, I shou'd not expect, that the affections wou'd rest there, and never transfuse themselves into any other impression. As there is here a person, who by means of a double relation is the object of my passion, the very same reasoning leads me to think the passion will be carry'd farther. The person has a relation of ideas to myself, according to the supposition; the passion, of which he is the object, by being either agreeable or uneasy, has a relation of impressions to pride or humility. 'Tis evident, then, that one of these passions must arise from the love or hatred.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This is the reasoning I form in conformity to my hypothesis; and am pleas'd to find upon trial that every thing answers exactly to my expectation. The virtue or vice of a son or brother not only excites love or hatred, but by a new transition, from similar causes, gives rise to pride or humility. Nothing causes greater vanity than any shining quality in our relations; as nothing mortifies us more than their vice or infamy. This exact conformity of experience to our reasoning is a convincing proof of the solidity of that hypothesis, upon which we reason.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Sixth Experiment. This evidence will be still augmented, if we reverse the experiment, and preserving still the same relations, begin only with a different passion. Suppose, that instead of the virtue or vice of a son or brother, which causes first love or hatred, and afterwards pride or humility, we place these good or bad qualities on ourselves, without any immediate connexion with the person, who is related to us: Experience shews us, that by this change of situation the whole chain is broke, and that the mind is not convey'd from one passion to another, as in the preceding instance. We never love or hate a son or brother for the virtue or vice we discern in ourselves; tho' 'tis evident the same qualities in him give us a very sensible pride or humility. The transition from pride or humility to love or hatred is not so natural as from love or hatred to pride or humility. This may at first sight be esteem'd contrary to my hypothesis; since the relations of impressions and ideas are in both cases precisely the same. Pride and humility are impressions related to love and hatred. Myself am related to the person. It shou'd, therefore, be expected, that like causes must produce like effects, and a perfect transition arise from the double relation, as in all other cases. This difficulty we may easily solve by the following reelections.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, that as we are at all times intimately conscious of ourselves, our sentiments and passions, their ideas must strike upon us with greater vivacity than the ideas of the sentiments and passions of any other person. But every thing, that strikes upon us with vivacity, and appears in a full and strong light, forces itself, in a manner, into our consideration, and becomes present to the mind on the smallest hint and most trivial relation. For the same reason when it is once present, it engages the attention, and keeps it from wandering to other objects, however strong may be their relation to our first object. The imagination passes easily from obscure to lively ideas, but with difficulty from lively to obscure. In the one case the relation is aided by another principle: In the other case, 'tis oppos'd by it. Now I have observ'd, that those two faculties of the mind, the imagination and passions, assist each other in their operation, when their propensities are similar, and when they act upon the same object. The mind has always a propensity to pass from a passion to any other related to it; and this propensity is forwarded when the object of the one passion is related to that of the other. The two impulses concur with each other, and render the whole transition more smooth and easy. But if it shou'd happen, that while the relation of ideas, strictly speaking, continues the same, its influence, in causing a transition of the imagination, shou'd no longer take place, 'tis evident its influence on the passions must also cease, as being dependent entirely on that transition. This is the reason why pride or humility is not transfus'd into love or hatred with the same ease, that the latter passions are chang'd into the former. If a person be my brother I am his likewise: But tho' the relations be reciprocal, they have very different effects on the imagination. The passage is smooth and open from the consideration of any person related to us to that of ourself, of whom we are every moment conscious. But when the affections are once directed to ourself, the fancy passes not with the same facility from that object to any other person, how closely so ever connected with us. This easy or difficult transition of the imagination operates upon the passions, and facilitates or retards their transition; which is a clear proof, that these two faculties of the passions and imagination are connected together, and that the relations of ideas have an influence upon the affections. Besides innumerable experiments that prove this, we here find, that even when the relation remains; if by any particular circumstance its usual effect upon the fancy in producing an association or transition of ideas, is prevented; its usual effect upon the passions, in conveying us from one to another, is in like manner prevented.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Some may, perhaps, find a contradiction betwixt this phænomenon and that of sympathy, where the mind passes easily from the idea of ourselves to that of any other object related to us. But this difficulty will vanish, if we consider that in sympathy our own person is not the object of any passion, nor is there any thing, that fixes our attention on ourselves; as in the present case, where we are suppos'd to be actuated with pride or humility. Ourself, independent of the perception of every other object, is in reality nothing: For which reason we must tum our view to external objects; and 'tis natural for us to consider with most attention such as lie contiguous to us, or resemble us. But when self is the object of a passion, 'tis not natural to quit the consideration of it, till the passion be exhausted; in which case the double relations of impressions and ideas can no longer operate.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Seventh Experiment. To put this whole reasoning to a farther trial, let us make a new experiment; and as we have already seen the effects of related passions and ideas, let us here suppose an identity of passions along with a relation of ideas; and let us consider the effects of this new situation. ’Tis evident a transition of the passions from the one object to the other is here in all reason to be expected; since the relation of ideas is suppos'd still to continue, and an identity of impressions must produce a stronger connexion, than the most perfect resemblance, that can be imagin'd. If a double relation, therefore, of impressions and ideas is able to produce a transition from one to the other, much more an identity of impressions with a relation of ideas. Accordingly we find, that when we either love or hate any person, the passions seldom continue within their first bounds; but extend themselves towards all the contiguous objects, and comprehend the friends and relations of him we love or hate. Nothing is more natural than to bear a kindness to one brother on account of our friendship for another, without any farther examination of his character. A quarrel with one person gives us a hatred for the whole family, tho' entirely innocent of that, which displeases us. Instances of this kind are every where to be met with.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is only one difficulty in this experiment, which it will be necessary to account for, before we proceed any farther. 'Tis evident, that tho' all passions pass easily from one object to another related to it, yet this transition is made with greater facility, where the more considerable object is first presented, and the lesser follows it, than where this order is revers'd, and the lesser takes the precedence. Thus 'tis more natural for us to love the son upon account of the father, than the father upon account of the son; the servant for the master, than the master for the servant; the subject for the prince, than the prince for the subject. In like manner we more readily contract a hatred against a whole family, where our first quarrel is with the head of it, than where we are displeas'd with a son, or servant, or some inferior member. In short, our passions, like other objects, descend with greater facility than they ascend.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">That we may comprehend, wherein consists the difficulty of explaining this phænomenon, we must consider, that the very same reason, which determines the imagination to pass from remote to contiguous objects, with more facility than from contiguous to remote, causes it likewise to change with more ease, the less for the greater, than the greater for the less. Whatever has the greatest influence is most taken notice of; and whatever is most taken notice of, presents itself most readily to the imagination. We are more apt to over-look in any subject, what is trivial, than what appears of considerable moment; but especially if the latter takes the precedence, and first engages our attention. Thus if any accident makes us consider the <i class="calibre10">Satellites</i> of <i class="calibre10">Jupiter</i>, our fancy is naturally determin'd to form the idea of that planet; but if we first reflect on the principal planet, 'tis more natural for us to overlook its attendants. The mention of the provinces of any empire conveys our thought to the seat of the empire; but the fancy returns not with the same facility to the consideration of the provinces. The idea of the servant makes us think of the master; that of the subject carries our view to the prince. But the same relation has not an equal influence in conveying us back again. And on this is founded that reproach of <i class="calibre10">Cornelia</i> to her sons, that they ought to be asham'd she shou'd be more known by the title of the daughter of <i class="calibre10">Scorpio</i>, than by that of the mother of the <i class="calibre10">Gracchi</i> This was, in other words, exhorting them to render themselves as illustrious and famous as their grandfather, otherwise the imagination of the people, passing from her who was intermediate, and plac'd in an equal relation to both, wou'd always leave them, and denominate her by what was more considerable and of greater moment. On the same principle is founded that common custom of making wives bear the name of their husbands, rather than husbands that of their wives; as also the ceremony of giving the precedence to those, whom we honour and respect. We might find many other instances to confirm this principle, were it not already sufficiently evident.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this easy transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former case, as well as in the latter? The virtues of a friend or brother produce first love, and then pride; because in that case the imagination passes from remote to contiguous, according to its propensity. Our own virtues produce not first pride, and then love to a friend or brother; because the passage in that case wou'd be from contiguous to remote, contrary to its propensity. But the love or hatred of an inferior causes not readily any passion to the superior, tho' that be the natural propensity of the imagination: While the love or hatred of a superior, causes a passion to the inferior, contrary to its propensity. In short, the same facility of transition operates not in the same manner upon superior and inferior as upon contiguous and remote.

		<p class="block_6 en">As the transition of ideas is here made contrary to the natural propensity of the imagination, that faculty must be overpower'd by some stronger principle of another kind; and as there is nothing ever present to the mind but impressions and ideas, this principle must necessarily lie in the impressions. Now it has been observ'd, that impressions or passions are connected only by their resemblance, and that where any two passions place the mind in the same or in similar dispositions, it very naturally passes from the one to the other: As on the contrary, a repugnance in the dispositions produces a difficulty in the transition of the passions. But 'tis observable, that this repugnance may arise from a deference of degree as well as of kind, nor do we experience a greater difficulty in passing suddenly from a small degree of love to a small degree of hatred, than from a small to a great degree of either of these affections. A man, when calm or only moderately agitated, is so different, in every respect, from himself, when disturbed with a violent passion, that no two persons can be more unlike; nor is it easy to pass from the one extreme to the other, without a considerable interval betwixt them.</p>

But the case is entirely alter'd, when the passions unite together, and actuate the mind at the same time. A weak passion, when added to a strong, makes not so considerable change in the disposition, as a strong when added to a weak; for which reason there is a closer connexion betwixt the great degree and the small, than betwixt the small degree and the great.</p>

Here then the contradiction betwixt the propensities of the imagination and passion displays itse1f. When we turn our thought to a great and a small object, the imagination finds more facility in passing from the small to the great, than from the great to the small; but the affections find a greater difficulty: And as the affections area more powerful principle than the imagination, no wonder they prevail over it, and draw the mind to their side. In spite of the difficulty of passing from the idea of great to that of little, a passion directed to the former, produces always a similar passion towards the latter; when the great and little are related together. The idea of the servant conveys our thought most readily to the master; but the hatred or love of the master produces with greater facility anger or good-will to the servant. The strongest passion in this case takes the precedence; and the addition of the weaker making no considerable change on the disposition, the passage is by that means render'd more easy and natural betwixt them.</p>

Two different degrees of the same passion are surely related together; but if the smaller be first present, it has little or no tendency to introduce the greater; and that because the addition of the great to the little, produces a more sensible alteration on the temper, than the addition of the little to the great.

In this opposition the passion in the end prevails over the imagination; but 'tis commonly by complying with it, and by seeking another quality, which may counter-ballance that principle, from whence the opposition arises. When we love the father or master of a family, we little think of his children or servants. But when these are present with us, or when it lies any ways in our power to serve them, the nearness and contiguity in this case encreases their magnitude, or at least removes that opposition, which the fancy makes to the transition of the affections. If the imagination finds a difficulty in passing from greater to less, it finds an equal facility in passing from remote to contiguous, which brings the matter to an equality, and leaves the way open from the one passion to the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Eighth Experiment. I have observ'd that the transition from love or hatred to pride or humility, is more easy than from pride or humility to love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in passing from contiguous to remote, is the cause why we scarce have any instance of the latter transition of the affections. I must, however, make one exception, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> when the very cause of the pride and humility is plac'd in some other person. For in that case the imagination is necessitated to consider the person, nor can it possibly confine its view to ourselves. Thus nothing more readily produces kindness and affection to any person, than his approbation of our conduct and character: As on the other hand, nothing inspires us with a stronger hatred, than his blame or contempt. Here 'tis evident, that the original passion is pride or humility, whose object is self; and that this passion is transfus'd into love or hatred, whose object is some other person, notwithstanding the rule I have already establish'd, <i class="calibre10">that the imagination passes with difficulty from contiguous to remote</i>. But the transition in this case is not made merely on account of the relation betwixt ourselves and the person; but because that very person is the real cause of our first passion, and of consequence is intimately connected with it. 'Tis his approbation that produces pride; and disapprobation, humility. No wonder, then, the imagination returns back again attended with the related passions of love and hatred. This is not a contradiction, but an exception to the rule; and an exception that arises from the same reason with the rule itself.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more evident, than that any person acquires our kindness, or is expos'd to our ill-will, in proportion to the pleasure or uneasiness we receive from him, and that the passions keep pace exactly with the sensations in all their changes and variations. Whoever can find the means either by his services, his beauty, or his flattery, to render himself useful or agreeable to us, is sure of our affections: As on the other hand, whoever harms or displeases us never fails to excite our anger or hatred. When our own nation is at war with any other, we detest them under the character of cruel, perfidious, unjust and violent: But always esteem ourselves and allies equitable, moderate, and merciful. If the general of our enemies be successful, 'tis with difficulty we allow him the figure and character of a man. He is a sorcerer: He has a communication with dæmons; as is reported of <i class="calibre10">Oliver Cromwell</i> and the <i class="calibre10">Duke of Luxembourg:</i> He is bloody minded, and takes a pleasure in death and destruction. But if the success be on our side, our commander has all the opposite good qualities, and is a pattern of virtue, as well as of courage and conduct. His treachery we call policy: His cruelty is an evil inseparable from war. In short, every one of his faults we either endeavour to extenuate, or dignify it with the name of that virtue, which approaches it. 'Tis evident the same method of thinking runs thro' common life.</p>

A man, who wounds and harms us by accident, becomes not our enemy upon that account, nor do we think ourselves bound by any ties of gratitude to one, who does us any service after the same manner. By the intention we judge of the actions, and according as that is good or bad, they become causes of love or hatred.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But here we must make a distinction. If that quality in another, which pleases or displeases, be constant and inherent in his person and character, it will cause love or hatred independent of the intention: But otherwise a knowledge and design is requisite, in order to give rise to these passions. One that is disagreeable by his deformity or folly is the object of our aversion, tho' nothing be more certain, than that he has not the least intention of displeasing us by these qualities. But if the uneasiness proceed not from a quality, but an action, which is produc'd and annihilated in a moment, 'tis necessary, in order to produce some relation, and connect this action sufficiently with the person, that it be deriv'd from a particular fore-thought and design. 'Tis not enough, that the action arise from the person, and have him for its immediate cause and author. This relation alone is too feeble and inconstant to be a foundation for these passions. It reaches not the sensible and thinking part, and neither proceeds from any thing <i class="calibre10">durable</i> in him, nor leaves any thing behind it; but passes in a moment, and is as if it had never been. On the other hand, an intention shews certain qualities, which remaining after the action is perform'd, connect it with the person, and facilitate the transition of ideas from one to the other. We can never think of him without reflecting on these qualities; unless repentance and a change of life have produc'd an alteration in that respect: In which case the passion is likewise alter'd. This therefore is one reason, why an intention is requisite to excite either love or hatred.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But we must farther consider, that an intention, besides its strengthening the relation of ideas, is often necessary to produce a relation of impressions, and give rise to pleasure and uneasiness. For 'tis observable, that the principal part of an injury is the contempt and hatred, which it shews in the person, that injures us; and without that, the mere harm gives us a less sensible uneasiness. In like manner, a good office is agreeable, chiefly because it flatters our vanity, and is a proof of the kindness and esteem of the person, who performs it. The removal of the intention, removes the mortification in the one case, and vanity in the other; and must of course cause a remarkable diminution in the passions of love and hatred.</p>

But then I ask, if the removal of design be able entirely to remove the passion of love and hatred? Experience, I am sure, informs us of the contrary, nor is there any thing more certain, than that men often fall into a violent anger for injuries, which they themselves must own to be entirely involuntary and accidental. This emotion, indeed, cannot be of long continuance; but still is sufficient to shew, that there is a natural connexion betwixt uneasiness and anger, and that the relation of impressions will operate upon a very small relation of ideas. But when the violence of the impression is once a little abated, the defect of the relation begins to be better felt; and as the character of a person is no wise interested in such injuries as are casual and involuntary, it seldom happens that on their account, we entertain a lasting enmity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate this doctrine by a parallel instance, we may observe, that not only the uneasiness, which proceeds from another by accident, has but little force to excite our passion, but also that which arises from an acknowledge'd necessity and duty. One that has a real design of harming us, proceeding not from hatred and ill-will, but from justice and equity, draws not upon him our anger, if we be in any degree reasonable; notwithstanding he is both the cause, and the knowing cause of our sufferings.

Whoever is united to us by any connexion is always sure of a share of our love, proportion'd to the connexion, without enquiring into his other qualities. Thus the relation of blood produces the strongest tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children, and a lesser degree of the same affection, as the relation lessens. Nor has consanguinity alone this effect, but any other relation without exception. We love our country-men, our neighbours, those of the same trade, profession, and even name with ourselves.

From this, say they, proceeds that continual search after amusement in gaming, in hunting, in business; by which we endeavour to forget ourselves, and excite our spirits from the languid state, into which they fall, when not sustain'd by some brisk and lively emotion. To this method of thinking I so far agree, that I own the mind to be insufficient, of itself, to its own entertainment, and that it naturally seeks after foreign objects, which may produce a lively sensation, and agitate the spirits. On the appearance of such an object it awakes, as it were, from a dream: The blood flows with a new tide: The heart is elevated: And the whole man acquires a vigour, which he cannot command in his solitary and calm moments. Hence company is naturally so rejoicing, as presenting the liveliest of all objects, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> a rational and thinking Being like ourselves, who communicates to us all the actions of his mind; makes us privy to his inmost sentiments and affections; and lets us see, in the very instant of their production, all the emotions, which are caus'd by any object.

Whatever is related to us is conceiv'd in a lively manner by the easy transition from ourselves to the related object. Custom also, or acquaintance facilitates the entrance, and strengthens the conception of any object. The first case is parallel to our reasoning's from cause and effect; the second to education. And as reasoning and education concur only in producing a lively and strong idea of any object; so is this the only particular, which is common to relation and acquaintance. This must, therefore, be the influencing quality, by which they produce all their common effects; and love or kindness being one of these effects, it must be from the force and liveliness of conception, that the passion is deriv'd. Such a conception is peculiarly agreeable, and makes us have an affectionate regard for every thing, that produces it, when the proper object of kindness and good-will.</p>

This not only happens, where they remark this resemblance betwixt themselves and others, but also by the natural course of the disposition, and by a certain sympathy, which always arises betwixt similar characters. Where they remark the resemblance, it operates after the manner of a relation, by producing a connexion of ideas.

But this change must be produc'd with the greater ease, that our natural temper gives us a propensity to the same impression, which we observe in others, and makes it arise upon any slight occasion. In that case resemblance converts the idea into an impression, not only by means of the relation, and by transfusing the original vivacity into the related idea; but also by presenting such materials as take fire from the least spark. And as in both cases a love or affection arises from the resemblance, we may learn that a sympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion to the spirits, since an easy sympathy and correspondent emotions are alone common to <i class="calibre10">relation</i>, <i class="calibre10">acquaintance</i>, and <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>.</p>

The mind finds a satisfaction and ease in the view of objects, to which it is accustom'd, and naturally prefers them to others, which, tho', perhaps, in themselves more valuable, are less known to it.

'Tis easy to remark in common life, that children esteem their relation to their mother to be weaken'd, in a great measure, by her second marriage, and no longer regard her with the same eye, as if she had continu'd in her state of widow-hood. Nor does this happen only, when they have felt any inconveniences from her second marriage, or when her husband is much her inferior; but even without any of these considerations, and merely because she has become part of another family. This also takes place with regard to the second marriage of a father; but in a much less degree: And 'tis certain the ties of blood are not so much loosen'd in the latter case as by the marriage of a mother. These two phænomena are remarkable in themselves, but much more so when compar'd.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to produce a perfect relation betwixt two objects, ’tis requisite, not only that the imagination be convey'd from one to the other by resemblance, contiguity or causation, but also that it return back from the second to the first with the same ease and facility. At first sight this may seem a necessary and unavoidable consequence. If one object resemble another, the latter object must necessarily resemble the former. If one object be the cause of another, the second object is effect to its cause. 'Tis the same case with contiguity: And therefore the relation being always reciprocal, it maybe thought, that the return of the imagination from the second to the first must also, in every case, be equally natural as its passage from the first to the second. But upon farther examination we shall easily discover our mistake. For supposing the second object, beside its reciprocal relation to the first, to have also a strong relation to a third object; in that case the thought, passing from the first object to the second, returns not back with the same facility, tho' the relation continues the same; but is readily carry'd on to the third object, by means of the new relation, which presents itself, and gives a new impulse to the imagination. This new relation, therefore, weakens the tie betwixt the first and second objects. The fancy is by its very nature wavering and inconstant; and considers always two objects as more strongly related together, where it finds the passage equally easy both in going and returning, than where the transition is easy only in one of these motions. The double motion is a kind of a double tie, and binds the objects together in the closest and most intimate manner.</p>

The thought has no longer the vibration, requisite to set it perfectly at ease, and indulge its inclination to change.

When my imagination goes from myself to my father, it passes not so readily from him to his second wife, nor considers him as entering into a different family, but as continuing the head of that family, of which I am myself a part. His superiority prevents the easy transition of the thought from him to his spouse, but keeps the passage still open for a return to myself along the same relation of child and parent. He is not sunk in the new relation he acquires; so that the double motion or vibration of thought is still easy and natural.

For as the ideas of pleasure can have an influence only by means of their vivacity, which makes them approach impressions, 'tis most natural those ideas shou'd have that influence, which are favour'd by most circumstances, and have a natural tendency to become strong and lively; such our ideas of the passions and sensations of any human creature.

And this is the more natural, that the pleasant idea or image produces here a passion towards the person, by means of his relation to the object; so that 'tis unavoidable but he must enter into the original conception, since he makes the object of the derivative passion.

I have also observ'd, that this approach, by an illusion of the fancy, appears much greater, when we ourselves are possest of the power, than when it is enjoy'd by another; and that in the former case the objects seem to touch upon the very verge of reality, and convey almost an equal satisfaction, as if actually in our possession. Now I assert, that where we esteem a person upon account of his riches, we must enter into this sentiment of the proprietor, and that without such a sympathy the idea of the agreeable objects, which they give him the power to produce, wou'd have but a feeble influence upon us. An avaricious man is respected for his money, tho' he scarce is possest of a <i class="calibre10">power</i>; that is, there scarce is a <i class="calibre10">probability</i> or even <i class="calibre10">possibility</i> of his employing it in the acquisition of the pleasures and conveniences of life.

Prisoners of war are always treated with a respect suitable to their condition; and 'tis certain riches go very far towards fixing the condition of any person. If birth and quality enter for a share, this still affords us an argument of the same kind. For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem?

A traveller is always admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as his train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune.

Riches give satisfaction to their possessor; and this satisfaction is convey'd to the beholder by the imagination, which produces an idea resembling the original impression in force and vivacity.

This is still more conspicuous in man, as being the creature of the universe, who has the most ardent desire of society, and is fitted for it by the most advantages. We can form no wish, which has not a reference to society. A perfect solitude is, perhaps, the greatest punishment we can suffer. Every pleasure languishes when enjoy'd a-part from company, and every pain becomes more cruel and intolerable. Whatever other passions we may be actuated by; pride, ambition, avarice, curiosity, revenge or lust; the soul or animating principle of them all is sympathy; nor wou'd they have any force, were we to abstract entirely from the thoughts and sentiments of others. Let all the powers and elements of nature conspire to serve and obey one man: Let the sun rise and set at his command: The sea and rivers roll as he pleases, and the earth furnish spontaneously whatever may be useful or agreeable to him: He will still be miserable, till you give him some one person at least, with whom he may share his happiness, and whose esteem and friendship he may enjoy.</p>

A man, who shews us any house or building, takes particular care among other things to point out the convenience of the apartments, the advantages of their situation, and the little room lost in the stairs, anti-chambers and passages; and indeed 'tis evident, the chief part of the beauty consists in these particulars. The observation of convenience gives pleasure, since convenience is a beauty. But after what manner does it give pleasure? 'Tis certain our own interest is not in the least concern'd; and as this is a beauty of interest, not of form, so to speak, it must delight us merely by communication, and by our sympathizing with the proprietor of the lodging.

Thus the pleasure, which a rich man receives from his possessions, being thrown upon the beholder, causes a pleasure and esteem; which sentiments again, being perceiv'd and sympathize'd with, encrease the pleasure of the possessor; and being once more reflected, become a new foundation for pleasure and esteem in the beholder. There is certainly an original satisfaction in riches deriv'd from that power, which they bestow, of enjoying all the pleasures of life; and as this is their very nature and essence, it must be the first source of all the passions, which arise from them. One of the most considerable of these passions is that of love or esteem in others, which therefore proceeds from a sympathy with the pleasure of the possessor. But the possessor has also a secondary satisfaction in riches arising from the love and esteem he acquires by them, and this satisfaction is nothing but a second reflexion of that original pleasure, which proceeded from himself. This secondary satisfaction or vanity becomes one of the principal recommendations of riches, and is the chief reason, why we either desire them for ourselves, or esteem them in others. Here then is a third rebound of the original pleasure; after which 'tis difficult to distinguish the images and reflexions, by reason of their faintness and confusion.</p>

But love and hatred are not compleated within themselves, nor rest in that emotion, which they produce, but carry the mind to something farther. Love is always follow'd by a desire of the happiness of the person belov'd, and an aversion to his misery: As hatred produces a desire of the misery and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated.

For tho' 'tis certain we never love any person without desiring his happiness, nor hate any without wishing his misery, yet these desires arise only upon the ideas of the happiness or misery of our friend or enemy being presented by the imagination, and are not absolutely essential to love and hatred. They are the most obvious and natural sentiments of these affections, but not the only ones. The passions may express themselves in a hundred ways, and may subsist a considerable time, without our reflecting on the happiness or misery of their objects; which clearly proves, that these desires are not the same with love and hatred, nor make any essential part of them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may, therefore, infer, that benevolence and anger are passions different from love and hatred, and only conjoin'd with them, by the original constitution of the mind. As nature has given to the body certain appetites and inclinations, which she encreases, diminishes, or changes according to the situation of the fluids or solids; she has proceeded in the same manner with the mind. According as we are possess'd with love or hatred, the correspondent desire of the happiness or misery of the person, who is the object of these passions, arises in the mind, and varies with each variation of these opposite passions. This order of things, abstractedly consider'd, is not necessary. Love and hatred might have been unattended with any such desires, or their particular connexion might have been entirely revers'd. If nature had so pleas'd, love might have had the same effect as hatred, and hatred as love. I see no contradiction in supposing a desire of producing misery annex'd to love, and of happiness to hatred. If the sensation of the passion and desire be opposite, nature cou'd have alter'd the sensation without altering the tendency of the desire, and by that means made them compatible with each other.</p>

Not to mention that women and children are most subject to pity, as being most guided by that faculty. The same infirmity, which makes them faint at the sight of a naked sword, tho' in the hands of their best friend, makes them pity extremely those, whom they find in any grief or addiction. Those philosophers, who derive this passion from I know not what subtile reflections on the instability of fortune, and our being liable to the same miseries we behold, will find this observation contrary to them among a great many others, which it were easy to produce.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There remains only to take notice of a pretty remarkable phænomenon of this passion; which is, that the communicated passion of sympathy sometimes acquires strength from the weakness of its original, and even arises by a transition from affections, which have no existence. Thus when a person obtains any honourable office, or inherits a great fortune, we are always the more rejoic'd for his prosperity, the less sense he seems to have of it, and the greater equanimity and indifference he shews in its enjoyment. In like manner a man, who is not dejected by misfortunes, is the more lamented on account of his patience; and if that virtue extends so far as utterly to remove all sense of uneasiness, it still farther encreases our compassion. When a person of merit falls into what is vulgarly esteem'd a great misfortune, we form a notion of his condition; and carrying our fancy from the cause to the usual effect, first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow, and then feel an impression of it, entirely overlooking that greatness of mind, which elevates him above such emotions, or only considering it so far as to encrease our admiration, love and tenderness for him. We find from experience, that such a degree of passion is usually connected with such a misfortune; and tho' there be an exception in the present case, yet the imagination is affected by the general rule, and makes us conceive a lively idea of the passion, or rather feel the passion itself; in the same manner, as if the person were really actuated by it. From the same principles we blush for the conduct of those, who behave themselves foolishly before us; and that tho' they shew no sense of shame, nor seem in the least conscious of their folly. All this proceeds from sympathy; but 'tis of a partial kind, and views its objects only on one side, without considering the other, which has a contrary effect, and wou'd entirely destroy that emotion, which arises from the first appearance.</p>

As we ourselves are here acquainted with the wretched situation of the person, it gives us a lively idea and sensation of sorrow, which is the passion that generally attends it; and this idea becomes still more lively, and the sensation more violent by a contrast with that security and indifference, which we observe in the person himself.

		<p class="block_6 en">This no one can doubt of with regard to our passions and sensations. But there may arise some difficulty with regard to our ideas and objects. When an object augments or diminishes to the eye or imagination from a comparison with others, the image and idea of the object are still the same, and are equally extended in the <i class="calibre10">retina</i>, and in the brain or organ of perception. The eyes refract the rays of light, and the optic nerves convey the images to the brain in the very same manner, whether a great or small object has preceded; nor does even the imagination alter the dimensions of its object on account of a comparison with others. The question then is, how from the same impression and the same idea we can form such different judgments concerning the same object, and at one time admire its bulk, and at another despise its littleness. This variation in our judgments must certainly proceed from a variation in some perception; but as the variation lies not in the immediate impression or idea of the object, it must lie in some other impression, that accompanies it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to explain this matter, I shall just touch upon two principles, one of which shall be more fully explain'd in the progress of this treatise; the other has been already accounted for. I believe it may safely be establish'd for a general maxim, that no object is presented to the senses, nor image form'd in the fancy, but what is accompany'd with some emotion or movement of spirits proportion'd to it; and however custom may make us insensible of this sensation, and cause us to confound it with the object or idea, 'twill be easy, by careful and exact experiments, to separate and distinguish them. For to instance only in the cases of extension and number; 'tis evident, that any very bulky object, such as the ocean, an extended plain, a vast chain of mountains, a wide forest; or any very numerous collection of objects, such as an army, a fleet, a crowd, excite in the mind a sensible emotion; and that the admiration, which arises on the appearance of such objects, is one of the most lively pleasures, which human nature is capable of enjoying. Now as this admiration encreases or diminishes by the encrease or diminution of the objects, we may conclude, according to our foregoing<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-453" title="60">60</a></sup> principles, that 'tis a compound effect, proceeding from the conjunction of the several effects, which arise from each part of the cause. Every part, then, of extension, and every unite of number has a separate emotion attending it, when conceiv'd by the mind; and tho' that emotion be not always agreeable, yet by its conjunction with others, and by its agitating the spirits to a just pitch, it contributes to the production of admiration, which is always agreeable. If this be allow'd with respect to extension and number, we can make no difficulty with respect to virtue and vice, wit and folly, riches and poverty, happiness and misery, and other objects of that kind, which are always attended with an evident emotion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The second principle I shall take notice of is that of our adherence to <i class="calibre10">general rules</i>; which has such a mighty influence on the actions and understanding, and is able to impose on the very senses. When an object is found by experience to be always accompany'd with another; whenever the first object appears, tho' chang'd in very material circumstances; we naturally fly to the conception of the second, and form an idea of it in as lively and strong a manner, as if we had infer'd its existence by the justest and most authentic conclusion of our understanding. Nothing can undeceive us, not even our senses, which, instead of correcting this false judgment, are often perverted by it, and seem to authorize its errors.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The conclusion I draw from these two principles, join'd to the influence of comparison above-mention'd, is very short and decisive. Every object is attended with some emotion proportioned to it; a great object with a great emotion, a small object with a small emotion. A great <i class="calibre10">object</i>, therefore, succeeding a small one makes a great <i class="calibre10">emotion</i> succeed a small one. Now a great emotion succeeding a small one becomes still greater, and rises beyond its ordinary proportion. But as there is a certain degree of an emotion, which commonly attends every magnitude of an object; when the emotion encreases, we naturally imagine that the object has likewise encreas'd. The effect conveys our view to its usual cause, a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of the object; nor do we consider, that comparison may change the emotion without changing any thing in the object. Those, who are acquainted with the metaphysical part of optics, and know how we transfer the judgments and conclusions of the understanding to the senses, will easily conceive this whole operation.</p>

Now as we seldom judge of objects from their intrinsic value, but form our notions of them from a comparison with other objects; it follows, that according as we observe a greater or less share of happiness or misery in others, we must make an estimate of our own, and feel a consequent pain or pleasure. The misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our happiness, and his happiness of our misery. The former, therefore, produces delight; and the latter uneasiness.</p>

In general we may observe, that in all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. A small object makes a great one appear still greater. A great object makes a little one appear less. Deformity of itself produces uneasiness; but makes us receive new pleasure by its contrast with a beautiful object, whose beauty is augmented by it; as on the other hand, beauty, which of itself produces pleasure, makes us receive a new pain by the contrast with any thing ugly, whose deformity it augments. The case, therefore, must be the same with happiness and misery. The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure, and therefore produces pain when compar'd with our own. His pain, consider'd in itself, is painful to us, but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.</p>

Thus the prospect of past pain is agreeable, when we are satisfy'd with our present condition; as on the other hand our past pleasures give us uneasiness, when we enjoy nothing at present equal to them.

'Tis from the principle of comparison that both these irregular appetites for evil arise. A person, who indulges himself in any pleasure, while his friend lies under affliction, feels the reflected uneasiness from his friend more sensibly by a comparison with the original pleasure, which he himself enjoys. This contrast, indeed, ought also to inliven the present pleasure. But as grief is here suppos'd to be the predominant passion, every addition falls to that side, and is swallow'd up in it, without operating in the least upon the contrary affection. 'Tis the same case with those penances, which men inflict on themselves for their past sins and failings. When a criminal reflects on the punishment he deserves, the idea of it is magnify’d by a comparison with his present ease and satisfaction; which forces him, in a manner, to seek uneasiness, in order to avoid so disagreeable a contrast.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This reasoning will account for the origin of envy as well as of malice. The only difference betwixt these passions lies in this, that envy is excited by some present enjoyment of another, which by comparison diminishes our idea of our own: Whereas malice is the unprovok'd desire of producing evil to another, in order to reap a pleasure from the comparison. The enjoyment, which is the object of envy, is commonly superior to our own. A superiority naturally seems to over shade us, and presents a disagreeable comparison. But even in the case of an inferiority, we still desire a greater distance, in order to augment still more the idea of ourself. When this distance diminishes, the comparison is less to our advantage; and consequently gives us less pleasure, and is even disagreeable. Hence arises that species of envy, which men feel, when they perceive their inferiors approaching or overtaking them in the pursuit of glory or happiness. In this envy we may see the effects of comparison twice repeated. A man, who compares himself to his inferior, receives a pleasure from the comparison: And when the inferiority decreases by the elevation of the inferior, what shou'd only have been a decrease of pleasure, becomes a real pain, by a new comparison with its preceding condition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis worthy of observation concerning that envy, which arises from a superiority in others, that 'tis not the great disproportion betwixt ourself and another, which produces it; but on the contrary, our proximity. A common soldier bears no such envy to his general as to his sergeant or corporal; nor does an eminent writer meet with so great jealousy in common hackney scribblers, as in authors, that more nearly approach him. It may, indeed, be thought, that the greater the disproportion is, the greater must be the uneasiness from the comparison. But we may consider on the other hand, that the great disproportion cuts off the tion, and either keeps us from comparing ourselves with what is remote from us, or diminishes the effects of the comparison. Resemblance and proximity always produce a relation of ideas; and where you destroy these ties, however other accidents may bring two ideas together; as they have no bond or connecting quality to join them in the imagination; ’tis impossible they can remain long united, or have any considerable influence on each other.</p>

When the fancy, in the comparison of objects, passes not easily from the one object to the other, the action of the mind is, in a great measure, broke, and the fancy, in considering the second object, begins, as it were, upon a new footing. The impression, which attends every object, seems not greater in that case by succeeding a less of the same kind; but these two impressions are distinct, and produce their distinct effects, without any communication together. The want of relation in the ideas breaks the relation of the impressions, and by such a separation prevents their mutual operation and influence.</p>

Yet even these relations, when join'd with superiority, by making the comparison more natural, make it likewise more grievous, and cause men to search for some other superiority, which may be attended with no relation, and by that means may have a less sensible influence on the imagination. The mind quickly perceives its several advantages and disadvantages; and finding its situation to be most uneasy, where superiority is conjoin'd with other relations, seeks its repose as much as possible, by their separation, and by breaking that association of ideas, which renders the comparison so much more natural and efficacious. When it cannot break the association, it feels a stronger desire to remove the superiority; and this is the reason why travellers are commonly so lavish of their praises to the <i class="calibre10">Chinese</i> and <i class="calibre10">Persians</i>, at the same time, that they depreciate those neighbouring nations, which may stand upon a foot of rivalship with their native country.</p>

But these are only the first foundations of the affections of pity and malice. Other passions are afterwards confounded with them. There is always a mixture of love or tenderness with pity, and of hatred or anger with malice. But it must be confess'd, that this mixture seems at first sight to be contradictory to my system.

This cannot take place with regard to pride and humility; because these are only pure sensations, without any direction or tendency to action. We are, therefore, to look for instances of this peculiar relation of impressions only in such affections, as are attended with a certain appetite or desire; such as those of love and hatred.</p>

A desire, therefore, of the happiness of another, and aversion to his misery, are similar to benevolence; and a desire of his misery and aversion to his happiness are correspondent to anger. Now pity is a desire of happiness to another, and aversion to his misery; as malice is the contrary appetite. Pity, then, is related to benevolence; and malice to anger: And as benevolence has been already found to be connected with love, by a natural and original quality, and anger with hatred; 'tis by this chain the passions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred.</p>

To confirm us in any design, we search for motives drawn from interest, from honour, from duty.

I have endeavour'd to prove, that power and riches, or poverty and meanness; which give rise to love or hatred, without producing any original pleasure or uneasiness; operate upon us by means of a secondary sensation deriv'd from a sympathy with that pain or satisfaction, which they produce in the person, who possesses them. From a sympathy with his pleasure there arises love; from that with his uneasiness, hatred. But 'tis a maxim, which I have just now establish'd, and which is absolutely necessary to the explication of the phænomena of pity and malice, 'That 'tis not the present sensation or momentary pain or pleasure, which determines the character of any passion, but the general bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end.' For this reason, pity or a sympathy with pain produces love, and that because it interests us in the fortunes of others, good or bad, and gives us a secondary sensation correspondent to the primary; in which it has the same influence with love and benevolence. Since then this rule holds good in one case, why does it not prevail throughout, and why does sympathy in uneasiness ever produce any passion beside good-will and kindness?

For supposing I saw a person perfectly unknown to me, who, while asleep in the fields, was in danger of being trod under foot by horses, I shou'd immediately run to his assistance; and in this I shou'd be actuated by the same principle of sympathy, which makes me concern'd for the present sorrows of a stranger. The bare mention of this is sufficient. Sympathy being nothing but a lively idea converted into an impression, 'tis evident, that, in considering the future possible or probable condition of any person, we may enter into it with so vivid a conception as to make it our own concern; and by that means be sensible of pains and pleasures, which neither belong to ourselves, nor at the present instant have any real existence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But however we may look forward to the future in sympathizing with any person, the extending of our sympathy depends in a great measure upon our sense of his present condition. 'Tis a great effort of imagination, to form such lively ideas even of the present sentiments of others as to feel these very sentiments; but 'tis impossible we cou'd extend this sympathy to the future, without being aided by some circumstance in the present, which strikes upon us in a lively manner. When the present misery of another has any strong influence upon me, the vivacity of the conception is not confin'd merely to its immediate object, but diffuses its influence over all the related ideas, and gives me a lively notion of all the circumstances of that person, whether past, present, or future; possible, probable or certain. By means of this lively notion I am interested in them; take part with them; and feel a sympathetic motion in my breast, conformable to whatever I imagine in his. If I diminish the vivacity of the first conception, I diminish that of the related ideas; as pipes can convey no more water than what arises at the fountain. By this diminution I destroy the future prospect, which is necessary to interest me perfectly in the fortune of another. I may feel the present impression, but carry my sympathy no farther, and never transfuse the force of the first conception into my ideas of the related objects. If it be another's misery, which is presented in this feeble manner, I receive it by communication, and am affected with all the passions related to it: But as I am not so much interested as to concern myself in his good fortune, as well as his bad, I never feel the extensive sympathy, nor the passions related to <i class="calibre10">it</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now in order to know what passions are related to these different kinds of sympathy, we must consider, that benevolence is an original pleasure arising from the pleasure of the person belov'd, and a pain proceeding from his pain: From which correspondence of impressions there arises a subsequent desire of his pleasure, and aversion to his pain. In order, then, to make a passion run parallel with benevolence, 'tis requisite we shou'd feel these double impressions, correspondent to those of the person, whom we consider; nor is any one of them alone sufficient for that purpose. When we sympathize only with one impression, and that a painful one, this sympathy is related to anger and to hatred, upon account of the uneasiness it conveys to us. But as the extensive or limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy; it follows, that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same principle. A strong impression, when communicated, gives a double tendency of the passions; which is related to benevolence and love by a similarity of direction; however painful the first impression might have been. A weak impression, that is painful, is related to anger and hatred by the resemblance of sensations. Benevolence, therefore, arises from a great degree of misery, or any degree strongly sympathize'd with: Hatred or contempt from a small degree, or one weakly sympathize'd with; which is the principle I intended to prove and explain.</p>

We may under-value a peasant or servant; but when the misery of a beggar appears very great, or is painted in very lively colours, we sympathize with him in his addictions, and feel in our heart evident touches of pity and benevolence. The same object causes contrary passions according to its different degrees. The passions, therefore, must depend upon principles, that operate in such certain degrees, according to my hypothesis. The encrease of the sympathy has evidently the same effect as the encrease of the misery.</p>

This deformity, however, proceeds in a great measure from a sympathy with the inhabitants, as has been already observ'd; but it is only a weak one, and reaches no farther than the immediate sensation, which is disagreeable.

This, perhaps, may be worth our notice. When the uneasiness is either small in itself, or remote from us, it engages not the imagination, nor is able to convey an equal concern for the fixture and contingent good, as for the present and real evil. Upon its acquiring greater force, we become so interested in the concerns of the person, as to be sensible both of his good and bad fortune; and from that compleat sympathy there arises pity and benevolence. But 'twill easily be imagin'd, that where the present evil strikes with more than ordinary force, it may entirely engage our attention, and prevent that double sympathy, above-mention'd. Thus we find, that tho' every one, but especially women, are apt to contract a kindness for criminals, who go to the scaffold, and readily imagine them to be uncommonly handsome and well-shap'd; yet one, who is present at the cruel execution of the rack, feels no such tender emotions; but is in a manner overcome with horror, and has no leisure to temper this uneasy sensation by any opposite sympathy.</p>

When we observe a person in misfortunes, we are affected with pity and love; but the author of that misfortune becomes the object of our strongest hatred, and is the more detested in proportion to the degree of our compassion. Now for what reason shou'd the same passion of pity produce love to the person, who suffers the misfortune, and hatred to the person, who causes it; unless it be because in the latter case the author bears a relation only to the misfortune; whereas in considering the sufferer we carry our view on every side, and wish for his prosperity, as well as are sensible of his affliction?</p>

We rejoice in their pleasures, and grieve for their sorrows, merely from the force of sympathy. Nothing that concerns them is indifferent to us; and as this correspondence of sentiments is the natural attendant of love, it readily produces that affection.</p>

Whether my reasoning be receiv'd or not, the phænomenon is undisputed, and appears in many instances. Among the rest, 'tis the reason why there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect, and why we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortify'd with the presence of one above us. Contempt or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride, that there scarce is any other passion discernable: Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility.

In like manner every quality, which, by being directly consider'd, produces hatred, ought always to give rise to pride by comparison, and by a mixture of these passions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt or scorn.

Nothing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity; tho' at the same time love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and infeeble it. The same difference is observable betwixt the uneasy passions. Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions; while humility and shame deject and discourage us.

Suppose, therefore, an object to be presented, which is peculiarly fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite pride; this object, belonging to another, gives rise directly to a great degree of love, but to a small one of humility by comparison; and consequently that latter passion is scarce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love into respect. This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility, generosity, beauty, and many other qualities. These have a peculiar aptitude to produce love in others; but not so great a tendency to excite pride in ourselves: For which reason the view of them, as belonging to another person, produces pure love, with but a small mixture of humility and respect.

		<p class="block_6 en">Of all the compound passions, which proceed from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections, no one better deserves our attention, than that love, which arises betwixt the sexes, as well on account of its force and violence, as those curious principles of philosophy, for which it affords us an incontestable argument. 'Tis plain, that this affection, in its most natural state, is deriv'd from the conjunction of three different impressions or passions, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> The pleasing sensation arising from beauty; the bodily appetite for generation; and a generous kindness or good-will. The origin of kindness from beauty may be explain'd from the foregoing reasoning. The question is how the bodily appetite is excited by it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The appetite of generation, when confin'd to a certain degree, is evidently of the pleasant kind, and has a strong connexion with all the agreeable emotions. Joy, mirth, vanity, and kindness are all incentives to this desire; as well as music, dancing, wine, and good cheer. On the other hand, sorrow, melancholy, poverty, humility are destructive of it. From this quality 'tis easily conceiv'd why it shou'd be connected with the sense of beauty.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But there is another principle that contributes to the same effect. I have observ'd that the parallel direction of the desires is a real relation, and no less than a resemblance in their sensation, produces a connexion among them. That we may fully comprehend the extent of this relation, we must consider, that any principal desire may be attended with subordinate ones, which are connected with it, and to which if other desires are parallel, they are by that means related to the principal one. Thus hunger may oft be consider'd as the primary inclination of the soul, and the desire of approaching the meat as the secondary one; since 'tis absolutely necessary to the satisfying that appetite. If an object, therefore by any separate qualities, inclines us to approach the meat, it naturally encreases our appetite; as on the contrary, whatever inclines us to set our victuals at a distance, is contradictory to hunger, and diminishes our inclination to them. Now 'tis plain that beauty has the first effect, and deformity the second: Which is the reason why the former gives us a keener appetite for our victuals, and the latter is sufficient to disgust us at the most savoury dish, that cookery has invented. All this is easily applicable to the appetite for generation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">From these two relations, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> resemblance and a parallel desire, there arises such a connexion betwixt the sense of beauty, the bodily appetite, and benevolence, that they become in a manner inseparable: And we find from experience, that 'tis indifferent which of them advances first; since any of them is almost sure to be attended with the related affections. One, who is inflam'd with lust, feels at least a momentary kindness towards the object of it, and at the same time fancies her more beautiful than ordinary; as there are many, who begin with kindness and esteem for the wit and merit of the person, and advance from that to the other passions. But the most common species of love is that which first arises from beauty, and afterwards diffuses itself into kindness and into the bodily appetite. Kindness or esteem, and the appetite to generation, are too remote to unite easily together. The one is, perhaps, the most refin'd passion of the soul; the other the most gross and vulgar. The love of beauty is plac'd in a just medium betwixt them, and partakes of both their natures: From whence it proceeds, that 'tis so singularly fitted to produce both.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This account of love is not peculiar to my system, but is unavoidable on any hypothesis. The three affections, which compose this passion, are evidently distinct, and has each of them its distinct object. 'Tis certain, therefore, that 'tis only by their relation they produce each other. But the relation of passions is not alone sufficient. 'Tis likewise necessary, there shou'd be a relation of ideas. The beauty of one person never inspires us with love for another. This then is a sensible proof of the double relation of impressions and ideas From one instance so evident as this we may form a judgment of the rest.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This may also serve in another view to illustrate what I have insisted on concerning the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred I have observ'd, that tho' self be the object of the first set of passions, and some other person of the second, yet these objects cannot alone be the causes of the passions; as having each of them a relation to two contrary affections, which must from the very first moment destroy each other. Here then is the situation of the mind, as I have already describ'd it. It has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a passion; that passion, when produc'd, naturally tums the view to a certain object. But this not being sufficient to produce the passion, there is requir'd some other emotion, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas may set these principles in action, and bestow on them their first impulse. This situation is still more remarkable with regard to the appetite of generation. Sex is not only the object, but also the cause of the appetite. We not only turn our view to it, when actuated by that appetite; but the reflecting on it suffices to excite the appetite. But as this cause loses its force by too great frequency, 'tis necessary it shou'd be quicken'd by some new impulse; and that impulse we find to arise from the <i class="calibre10">beauty</i> of the <i class="calibre10">person</i>; that is, from a double relation of impressions and ideas. Since this double relation is necessary where an affection has both a distinct cause, and object, how much more so, where it has only a distinct object, without any determinate cause?</p>

The actions, therefore, of matter are to be regarded as instances of necessary actions; and whatever is in this respect on the same footing with matter, must be acknowledge'd to be necessary.

If objects had not an uniform and regular conjunction with each other, we shou'd never arrive at any idea of cause and effect; and even after all, the necessity, which enters into that idea, is nothing but a determination of the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant, and infer the existence of one from that of the other.

As the actions of matter have no necessity, but what is deriv'd from these circumstances, and it is not by any insight into the essence of bodies we discover their connexion, the absence of this insight, while the union and inference remain, will never, in any case, remove the necessity. 'Tis the observation of the union, which produces the inference; for which reason it might be thought sufficient, if we prove a constant union in the actions of the mind, in order to establish the inference, along with the necessity of these actions.

When any phænomena are constantly and invariably conjoin'd together, they acquire such a connexion in the imagination, that it passes from one to the other, without any doubt or hesitation. But below this there are many inferior degrees of evidence and probability, nor does one single contrariety of experiment entirely destroy all our reasoning. The mind balances the contrary experiments, and deducting the inferior from the superior, proceeds with that degree of assurance or evidence, which remains. Even when these contrary experiments are entirely equal, we remove not the notion of causes and necessity; but supposing that the usual contrariety proceeds from the operation of contrary and conceal'd causes, we conclude, that the chance or indifference lies only in our judgment on account of our imperfect knowledge, not in the things themselves, which are in every case equally necessary, tho' to appearance not equally constant or certain. No union can be more constant and certain, than that of some actions with some motives and characters; and if in other cases the union is uncertain, 'tis no more than what happens in the operations of body, nor can we conclude any thing from the one irregularity, which will not follow equally from the other.</p>

Now moral evidence is nothing but a conclusion concerning the actions of men, deriv'd from the consideration of their motives, temper and situation. Thus when we see certain characters or figures describ'd upon paper, we infer that the person, who produc'd them, would affirm such facts, the death of <i class="calibre10">Cæsar</i>, the success of <i class="calibre10">Augustus</i>, the cruelty of <i class="calibre10">Nero</i>; and remembering many other concurrent testimonies we conclude, that those facts were once really existent, and that so many men, without any interest, wou'd never conspire to deceive us; especially since they must, in the attempt, expose themselves to the derision of all their contemporaries, when these facts were asserted to be recent and universally known. The same kind of reasoning runs thro' politics, war, commerce, economy, and indeed mixes itself so entirely in human life, that 'tis impossible to act or subsist a moment without having recourse to it. A prince, who imposes a tax upon his subjects, expects their compliance. A general, who conducts an army, makes account of a certain degree of courage. A merchant looks for fidelity and skill in his factor or super-cargo. A man, who gives orders for his dinner, doubts not of the obedience of his servants. In short, as nothing more nearly interests us than our own actions and those of others, the greatest part of our reasonings is employ'd in judgments concerning them. Now I assert, that whoever reasons after this manner, does <i class="calibre10">ipso facto</i> believe the actions of the will to arise from necessity, and that he knows not what he means, when he denies it.</p>

A prisoner, who has neither money nor interest, discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well from the obstinacy of the goaler, as from the walls and bars with which he is surrounded; and in all attempts for his freedom chuses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards as from the operation of the ax or wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape, the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and body; bleeding, convulsive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference betwixt them in passing from one link to another; nor is less certain of the future event than if it were connected with the present impressions of the memory and senses by a train of causes cemented together by what we are pleas'd to call a <i class="calibre10">physical necessity</i>.

		<p class="block_6 en">I believe we may assign the three following reasons for the prevalence of the doctrine of liberty, however absurd it may be in one sense, and unintelligible in any other. First, After we have perform'd any action; tho' we confess we were influenc'd by particular views and motives; 'tis difficult for us to perswade ourselves we were govern'd by necessity, and that 'twas utterly impossible for us to have acted otherwise; the idea of necessity seeming to imply something of force, and violence, and constraint, of which we are not sensible. Few are capable of distinguishing betwixt the liberty of <i class="calibre10">spontaniety</i>, as it is cal1'd in the schools, and the liberty of <i class="calibre10">indifference</i>; betwixt that which is oppos'd to violence, and that which means a negation of necessity and causes. The first is even the most common sense of the word; and as 'tis only that species of liberty, which it concerns us to preserve, our thoughts have been principally turn'd towards it, and have almost universally confounded it with the other.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, there is a <i class="calibre10">false sensation or experience</i> even of the liberty of indifference; which is regarded as an argument for its real existence. The necessity of any action, whether of matter or of the mind, is not properly a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may consider the action, and consists in the determination of his thought to infer its existence from some preceding objects: As liberty or chance, on the other hand, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain looseness, which we feel in passing or not passing from the idea of one to that of the other. Now we may observe, that tho' in reflecting on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indifference, yet it very commonly happens, that in performing the actions themselves we are sensible of something like it: And as all related or resembling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employ'd as a demonstrative or even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing; because when by a denial of it we are provok'd to try, we feel that it moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself even on that side, on which it did not settle. This image or faint motion, we perswade ourselves, cou'd have been compleated into the thing itself; because, shou'd that be deny'd, we find, upon a second trial, that it can. But these efforts are all in vain; and whatever capricious and irregular actions we may perform; as the desire of showing our liberty is the sole motive of our actions; we can never free ourselves from the bonds of necessity. We may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves; but a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">A third reason why the doctrine of liberty has generally been better receiv'd in the world, than its antagonist, proceeds from <i class="calibre10">religion</i>, which has been very unnecessarily interested in this question. There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical debates to endeavour to refute any hypothesis by a pretext of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads us into absurdities, 'tis certainly false; but 'tis not certain an opinion is false, because 'tis of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be foreborn, as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general, without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I submit myself frankly to an examination of this kind, and dare venture to affirm, that the doctrine of necessity, according to my explication of it, is not only innocent, but even advantageous to religion and morality.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I define necessity two ways, conformable to the two definitions of <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, of which it makes an essential part. I place it either in the constant union and conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the mind from the one to the other. Now necessity, in both these senses, has universally, tho' tacitely, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allow'd to belong to the will of man, and no one has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those inferences are founded on the experience'd union of like actions with like motives and circumstances. The only particular in which any one can differ from me, is either, that perhaps he will refuse to call this necessity. But as long as the meaning is understood, I hope the word can do no harm. Or that he will maintain there is something else in the operations of matter. Now whether it be so or not is of no consequence to religion, whatever it may be to natural philosophy. I may be mistaken in asserting, that we have no idea of any other connexion in the actions of body, and shall be glad to be farther instructed on that head: But sure I am, I ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind, but what must readily be allow'd of. Let no one, therefore, put an invidious construction on my words, by saying simply, that I assert the necessity of human actions, and place them on the same footing with the operations of senseless matter. I do not ascribe to the will that unintelligible necessity, which is suppos'd to lie in matter. But I ascribe to matter, that intelligible quality, call it necessity or not, which the most rigorous orthodoxy does or must allow to belong to the will. I change, therefore, nothing in the receiv'd systems, with regard to the will, but only with regard to material objects.</p>

'Tis indeed certain, that as all human laws are founded on rewards and punishments, 'tis suppos'd as a fundamental principle, that these motives have an influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but as 'tis usually conjoin'd with the action, common sense requires it shou'd be esteem'd a cause, and be look'd upon as an instance of that necessity, which I wou'd establish.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This reasoning is equally solid, when apply'd to <i class="calibre10">divine</i> laws, so far as the deity is consider'd as a legislator, and is suppos'd to indict punishment and bestow rewards with a design to produce obedience. But I also maintain, that even where he acts not in his magisterial capacity, but is regarded as the avenger of crimes merely on account of their odiousness and deformity, not only 'tis impossible, without the necessary connexion of cause and effect in human actions, that punishments cou'd be inflicted compatible with justice and moral equity; but also that it cou'd ever enter into the thoughts of any reasonable being to indict them. The constant and universal object of hatred or anger is a person or creature endow'd with thought and consciousness; and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion, 'tis only by their relation to the person or connexion with him. But according to the doctrine of liberty or chance, this connexion is reduc'd to nothing, nor are men more accountable for those actions, which are design'd and premeditated, than for such as are the most casual and accidental. Actions are by their very nature temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in the characters and disposition of the person, who perform'd them, they infix not themselves upon him, and can neither redound to his honour, if good, nor infamy, if evil. The action itself may be blameable; it may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion: But the person is not responsible for it; and as it proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable or constant, and leaves nothing of that nature behind it, 'tis impossible he can, upon its account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. According to the hypothesis of liberty, therefore, a man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the most horrid crimes, as at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character any way concern'd in his actions; since they are not deriv'd from it, and the wickedness of the one can never be us'd as a proof of the depravity of the other. 'Tis only upon the principles of necessity, that a person acquires any merit or demerit from his actions, however the common opinion may incline to the contrary.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But so inconsistent are men with themselves, that tho' they often assert, that necessity utterly destroys all merit and demerit either towards mankind or superior powers, yet they continue still to reason upon these very principles of necessity in all their judgments concerning this matter. Men are not blam'd for such evil actions as they perform ignorantly and casually, whatever may be their consequences. Why? but because the causes of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them alone. Men are less blam'd for such evil actions, as they perform hastily and unpremeditately, than for such as proceed from thought and deliberation. For what reason? but because a hasty temper, tho' a constant cause in the mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every crime, especially if attended with an evident reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for? But by asserting that actions render a person criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal passions or principles in the mind; and when by any alteration of these principles they cease to be just proofs, they likewise cease to be criminal.

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more usual in philosophy, and even in common life, than to talk of the combat of passion and reason, to give the preference to reason, and to assert that men are only so far virtuous as they conform themselves to its dictates. Every rational creature, 'tis said, is oblig'd to regulate his actions by reason; and if any other motive or principle challenge the direction of his conduct, he ought to oppose it, 'till it be entirely subdu'd, or at least brought to a conformity with that superior principle. On this method of thinking the greatest part of moral philosophy, ancient and modern, seems to be founded; nor is there an ampler field, as well for metaphysical arguments, as popular declamations, than this suppos'd pre-eminence of reason above passion. The eternity, invariableness, and divine origin of the former have been display'd to the best advantage: The blindness, inconstancy, and deceitfulness of the latter have been as strongly insisted on. In order to shew the fallacy of all this philosophy, I shall endeavour to prove <i class="calibre10">first</i>, that reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will; and <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, that it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The understanding exerts itself after two different ways, as it judges from demonstration or probability; as it regards the abstract relations of our ideas, or those relations of objects, of which experience only gives us information. I believe it scarce will be asserted, that the first species of reasoning alone is ever the cause of any action. As it's proper province is the world of ideas, and as the will always places us in that of realities, demonstration and volition seem, upon that account, to be totally remov'd, from each other. Mathematics, indeed, are useful in all mechanical operations, and arithmetic in almost every art and profession: But 'tis not of themselves they have any influence. Mechanics are the art of regulating the motions of bodies <i class="calibre10">to some design'd end or purpose</i>; and the reason why we employ arithmetic in fixing the proportions of numbers, is only that we may discover the proportions of their influence and operation. A merchant is desirous of knowing the sum total of his accounts with any person: Why? but that he may learn what sum will have the same <i class="calibre10">effects</i> in paying his debt, and going to market, as all the particular articles taken together. Abstract or demonstrative reasoning, therefore, never influences any of our actions, but only as it directs our judgment concerning causes and effects; which leads us to the second operation of the understanding.</p>

'Tis also obvious, that this emotion rests not here, but making us cast our view on every side, comprehends whatever objects are connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect. Here then reasoning takes place to discover this relation; and according as our reasoning varies, our actions receive a subsequent variation. But 'tis evident in this case, that the impulse arises not from reason, but is only directed by it. 'Tis from the prospect of pain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises towards any object: And these emotions extend themselves to the causes and effects of that object, as they are pointed out to us by reason and experience. It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give them any influence; and 'tis plain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us.</p>

This consequence is necessary. 'Tis impossible reason cou'd have the latter effect of preventing volition, but by giving an impulse in a contrary direction to our passion; and that impulse, had it operated alone, wou'd have been able to produce volition. Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion, but a contrary impulse; and if this contrary impulse ever arises from reason, that latter faculty must have an original influence on the will, and must be able to cause, as well as hinder any act of volition. But if reason has no original influence, 'tis impossible it can withstand any principle, which has such an efficacy, or ever keep the mind in suspence a moment. Thus it appears, that the principle, which opposes our passion, cannot be the same with reason, and is only call'd so in an improper sense. We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.

According to this principle, which is so obvious and natural, 'tis only in two senses, that any affection can be call'd unreasonable. First, When a passion, such as hope or fear, grief or joy, despair or security, is founded on the supposition of the existence of objects, which really do not exist. Secondly, When in exerting any passion in action, we chuse means insufficient for the design'd end, and deceive ourselves in our judgment of causes and effects. Where a passion is neither founded on false suppositions, nor chuses means insufficient for the end, the understanding can neither justify nor condemn it. 'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. 'Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an <i class="calibre10">Indian</i> or person wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledge'd lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter. A trivial good may, from certain circumstances, produce a desire superior to what arises from the greatest and most valuable enjoyment; nor is there any thing more extraordinary in this, than in mechanics to see one pound weight raise up a hundred by the advantage of its situation. In short, a passion must be accompany'd with some false judgment, in order to its being unreasonable; and even then 'tis not the passion, properly speaking, which is unreasonable, but the judgment.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The consequences are evident. Since a passion can never, in any sense, be call'd unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition, or when it chuses means insufficient for the design'd end, 'tis impossible, that reason and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the government of the will and actions. The moment we perceive the falshood of any supposition, or the insufficiency of any means our passions yield to our reason without any opposition. I may desire any fruit as of an excellent relish; but whenever you convince me of my mistake, my longing ceases. I may will the performance of certain actions as means of obtaining any desir'd good; but as my willing of these actions is only secondary, and founded on the supposition, that they are causes of the propos'd effect; as soon as I discover the falshood of that supposition, they must become indifferent to me.</p>

Reason, for instance, exerts itself without producing any sensible emotion; and except in the more sublime disquisitions of philosophy, or in the frivolous subtilties of the schools, scarce ever conveys any pleasure or uneasiness. Hence it proceeds, that every action of the mind, which operates with the same calmness and tranquillity, is confounded with reason by all those, who judge of things from the first view and appearance. Now 'tis certain, there are certain calm desires and tendencies, which, tho' they be real passions, produce little emotion in the mind, and are more known by their effects than by the immediate feeling or sensation. These desires are of two kinds; either certain instincts originally implanted in our natures, such as benevolence and resentment, the love of life, and kindness to children; or the general appetite to good, and aversion to evil, consider'd merely as such. When any of these passions are calm, and cause no disorder in the soul, they are very readily taken for the determinations of reason, and are suppos'd to proceed from the same faculty, with that, which judges of truth and falshood. Their nature and principles have been suppos'd the same, because their sensations are not evidently different.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Beside these calm passions, which often determine the will, there are certain violent emotions of the same kind, which have likewise a great influence on that faculty. When I receive any injury from another, I often feel a violent passion of resentment, which makes me desire his evil and punishment, independent of all considerations of pleasure and advantage to myself. When I am immediately threaten'd with any grievous ill, my fears, apprehensions, and aversions rise to a great height, and produce a sensible emotion. The common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the direction of the will entirely to one of these principles, and supposing the other to have no influence. Men often act knowingly against their interest: For which reason the view of the greatest possible good does not always influence them. Men often counter-act a violent passion in prosecution of their interests and designs: 'Tis not therefore the present uneasiness alone, which determines them. In general we may observe, that both these principles operate on the will; and where they are contrary, that either of them prevails, according to the <i class="calibre10">general</i> character or <i class="calibre10">present</i> disposition of the person. What we call strength of mind, implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent; tho' we may easily observe, there is no man so constantly possess'd of this virtue, as never on any occasion to yield to the solicitations of passion and desire. From these variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning the actions and resolutions of men, where there is any contrariety of motives and passions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is not in philosophy a subject of more nice speculation than this of the different <i class="calibre10">causes</i> and <i class="calibre10">effects</i> of the calm and violent passions. 'Tis evident passions influence not the will in proportion to their violence, or the disorder they occasion in the temper; but on the contrary, that when a passion has once become a settled principle of action, and is the predominant inclination of the soul, it commonly produces no longer any sensible agitation. As repeated custom and its own force have made every thing yield to it, it directs the actions and conduct without that opposition and emotion, which so naturally attend every momentary gust of passion. We must, therefore, distinguish betwixt a calm and a weak passion; betwixt a violent and a strong one. But notwithstanding this, 'tis certain, that when we wou'd govern a man, and push him to any action, 'twill commonly be better policy to work upon the violent than the calm passions, and rather take him by his inclination, than what is vulgarly call'd his reason. We ought to place the object in such particular situations as are proper to encrease the violence of the passion. For we may observe, that all depends upon the situation of the object, and that a variation in this particular will be able to change the calm and the violent passions into each other. Both these kinds of passions pursue good, and avoid evil; and both of them are encreas'd or diminish'd by the encrease or diminution of the good or evil. But herein lies the difference betwixt them: The same good, when near, will cause a violent passion, which, when remote, produces only a calm one. As this subject belongs very properly to the present question conceding the will, we shall here examine it to the bottom, and shall consider some of those circumstances and situations of objects, which render a passion either calm or violent.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis a remarkable property of human nature, that any emotion, which attends a passion, is easily converted into it, tho' in their natures they be originally different from, and even contrary to each other. 'Tis true; in order to make a perfect union among passions, there is always requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas; nor is one relation sufficient for that purpose. But tho' this be confirm'd by undoubted experience, we must understand it with its proper limitations, and must regard the double relation, as requisite only to make one passion produce another. When two passions are already produc'd by their separate causes, and are both present in the mind, they readily mingle and unite, tho' they have but one relation, and sometimes without any. The predominant passion swallows up the inferior, and converts it into itself. The spirits, when once excited, easily receive a change in their direction; and 'tis natural to imagine this change will come from the prevailing affection. The connexion is in many respects closer betwixt any two passions, than betwixt any passion and indifference.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">When a person is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprice of his mistress, the jealousies and quarrels, to which that commerce is so subject; however unpleasant and related to anger and hatred; are yet found to give additional force to the prevailing passion. 'Tis a common artifice of politicians, when they wou'd affect any person very much by a matter of fact, of which they intend to inform him, first to excite his curiosity; delay as long as possible the satisfying it; and by that means raise his anxiety and impatience to the utmost, before they give him a full insight into the business. They know that his curiosity will precipitate him into the passion they design to raise, and assist the object in its influence on the mind. A soldier advancing to the battle, is naturally inspir'd with courage and confidence, when he thinks on his friends and fellow-soldiers; and is struck with fear and terror, when he reflects on the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore, proceeds from the former naturally encreases the courage; as the same emotion, proceeding from the latter, augments the fear; by the relation of ideas, and the conversion of the inferior emotion into the predominant. Hence it is that in martial discipline, the uniformity and lustre of our habit, the regularity of our figures and motions, with ah the pomp and majesty of war, encourage ourselves and allies; while the same objects in the enemy strike terror into us, tho' agreeable and beautiful in themselves.</p>

For 'tis observable that an opposition of passions commonly causes a new emotion in the spirits, and produces more disorder, than the concurrence of any two affections of equal force. This new emotion is easily converted into the predominant passion, and encreases its violence, beyond the pitch it wou'd have arriv'd at had it met with no opposition. Hence we naturally desire what is forbid, and take a pleasure in performing actions, merely because they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when opposite to the passions, is seldom able to overcome them; and when it fails of that effect, is apt rather to encrease them, by producing an opposition in our motives and principles.</p>

Ourself is intimately present to us, and whatever is related to self must partake of that quality. But where an object is so far remov'd as to have lost the advantage of this relation, why, as it is farther remov'd, its idea becomes still fainter and more obscure, wou'd, perhaps, require a more particular examination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis obvious, that the imagination can never totally forget the points of space and time, in which we are existent; but receives such frequent advertisements of them from the passions and senses, that however it may turn its attention to foreign and remote objects, it is necessitated every moment to reflect on the present. 'Tis also remarkable, that in the conception of those objects, which we regard as real and existent, we take them in their proper order and situation, and never leap from one object to another, which is distant from it, without running over, at least in a cursory manner, all those objects, which are interpos'd betwixt them. When we reflect, therefore, on any object distant from ourselves, we are oblig'd not only to reach it at first by passing thro all the intermediate space betwixt ourselves and the object, but also to renew our progress every moment; being every moment recall'd to the consideration of ourselves and our present situation. 'Tis easily conceiv'd, that this interruption must weaken the idea by breaking the action of the mind, and hindering the conception from being so intense and continu'd, as when we reflect on a nearer object. The <i class="calibre10">fewer</i> steps we make to arrive at the object, and the <i class="calibre10">smoother</i> the road is, this diminution of vivacity is less sensibly felt, but still may be observ'd more or less in proportion to the degrees of distance and difficulty.</p>

This is their effect on the imagination. If my reasoning be just, they must have a proportion able effect on the will and passions. Contiguous objects must have an influence much superior to the distant and remote. Accordingly we find in common life, that men are principally concern'd about those objects, which are not much remov'd either in space or time, enjoying the present, and leaving what is afar off to the care of chance and fortune. Talk to a man of his condition thirty years hence, and he will not regard you. Speak of what is to happen to-morrow, and he will lend you attention. The breaking of a minor gives us more concern when at home, than the burning of a house, when abroad, and some hundred leagues distant.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The cause of this phænomenon must evidently lie in the different properties of space and time. Without having recourse to metaphysics, any one may easily observe, that space or extension consists of a number of co-existent parts dispos'd in a certain order, and capable of being at once present to the sight or feeling. On the contrary, time or succession, tho' it consists likewise of parts, never presents to us more than one at once; nor is it possible for any two of them ever to be co-existent. These qualities of the objects have a suitable effect on the imagination. The parts of extension being susceptible of an union to the senses, acquire an union in the fancy; and as the appearance of one part excludes not another, the transition or passage of the thought thro' the contiguous parts is by that means render'd more smooth and easy. On the other hand, the incompatibility of the parts of time in their real existence separates them in the imagination, and makes it more <i class="calibre10">difficult</i> for that faculty to trace any long succession or series of events. Every part must appear single and alone, nor an regularly have entrance into the fancy without banishing what is suppos'd to have been immediately precedent. By this means any distance in time causes a greater interruption in the thought than an equal distance in space, and consequently weakens more considerably the idea, and consequently the passions; which depend in a great measure, on the imagination, according to my system.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is another phænomenon of a like nature with the foregoing, viz. <i class="calibre10">the superior effects of the same distance in futurity above that in the past</i>. This difference with respect to the will is easily accounted for. As none of our actions can alter the past, 'tis not strange it shou'd never determine the will.

		<p class="block_6 en">Besides the propensity to a gradual progression thro' the points of space and time, we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking, which concurs in producing this phænomenon. We always follow the succession of time in placing our ideas, and from the consideration of any object pass more easily to that, which follows immediately after it, than to that which went before it. We may learn this, among other instances, from the order, which is always observ'd in historical narrations. Nothing but an absolute necessity can oblige an historian to break the order of time, and in his <i class="calibre10">narration</i> give the precedence to an event, which was in <i class="calibre10">reality</i> posterior to another.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This will easily be appIy'd to the question in hand, if we reflect on what I have before observ'd, that the present situation of the person is always that of the imagination, and that 'tis from thence we proceed to the conception of any distant object. When the object is past, the progression of the thought in passing to it from the present is contrary to nature, as proceeding from one point of time to that which is preceding, and from that to another preceding, in opposition to the natural course of the succession. On the other hand, when we turn our thought to a future object, our fancy flows along the stream of time, and arrives at the object by an order, which seems most natural, passing always from one point of time to that which is immediately posterior to it. This <i class="calibre10">easy</i> progression of ideas favours the imagination, and makes it conceive its object in a stronger and fuller light, than when we are continually oppos'd in our passage, and are oblig'd to overcome the difficulties arising from the natural propensity of the fancy. A small degree of distance in the past has, therefore, a greater effect, in interrupting and weakening the conception, than a much greater in the future. From this effect of it on the imagination is deriv'd its influence on the will and passions.</p>

<div class="top right">

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is another cause, which both contributes to the same effect, and proceeds from the same quality of the fancy, by which we are determin'd to trace the succession of time by a similar succession of ideas. When from the present instant we consider two points of time equally distant in the future and in the past, 'tis evident, that, abstractedly consider'd, their relation to the present is almost equal. For as the future will <i class="calibre10">sometime</i> be present, so the past was <i class="calibre10">once</i> present. If we cou'd, therefore, remove this quality of the imagination, an equal distance in the past and in the future, wou'd have a similar influence. Nor is this only true, when the fancy remains fix'd, and from the present instant surveys the future and the past; but also when it changes its situation, and places us in different periods of time. For as on the one hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present instant and the future object, we find the future object approach to us, and the past retire, and become more distant: So on the other hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and the past, the past approaches to us, and the future becomes more distant. But from the property of the fancy above-mention'd we rather chuse to fix our thought on the point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and the future, than on that betwixt the present and the past. We advance, rather than retard our existence; and following what seems the natural succession of time, proceed from past to present, and from present to future. By which means we conceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us, and the past as retiring. An equal distance, therefore, in the past and in the future, has not the same effect on the imagination; and that because we consider the one as continually encreasing, and the other as continually diminishing. The fancy anticipates the course of things. and surveys the object in that condition, to which it tends, as well as in that, which is regarded as the present.</p>

We must now consider three phænomena, which seem to be, in a manner, the reverse of these: Why a very great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object: Why such a distance in time encreases it more than that in space: And a distance in past time more than that in future.

		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the first phænomenon, why a great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object; 'tis evident that the mere view and contemplation of any greatness, whether successive or extended, enlarges the soul, and give it a sensible delight and pleasure. A wide plain, the ocean, eternity, a succession of several ages; all these are entertaining objects, and excel every thing, however beautiful, which accompanies not its beauty with a suitable greatness. Now when any very distant object is presented to the imagination, we naturally reflect on the interpos'd distance, and by that means, conceiving something great and magnificent, receive the usual satisfaction. But as the fancy passes easily from one idea. to another related to it, and transports to the second all the passions excited by the first, the admiration, which is directed to the distance, naturally diffuses itself over the distant object. Accordingly we find, that 'tis not necessary the object shou'd be actually distant from us, in order to cause our admiration; but that 'tis sufficient, if, by the natural association of ideas, it conveys our view to any considerable distance. A great traveller, 'tho in the same chamber, will pass for a very extraordinary person; as a <i class="calibre10">Greek</i> medal, even in our cabinet, is always esteem'd a valuable curiosity. Here the object, by a natural transition, conveys our view to the distance; and the admiration, which arises from that distance, by another natural transition, returns back to the object.</p>

Now 'tis certain, that the tendency of bodies, continually operating upon our senses, must produce, from custom, a like tendency in the fancy, and that when we consider any object situated in an ascent, the idea of its weight gives us a propensity to transport it from the place, in which it is situated, to the place immediately below it, and so on, till we come to the ground, which equally stops the body and our imagination. For a like reason we feel a difficulty in mounting, and pass not without a kind of reluctance from the inferior to that which is situated above it; as if our ideas acquir'd a kind of gravity from their objects. As a proof of this, do we not find, that the facility, which is so much study`d in music and poetry, is call'd the fall or cadency of the harmony or period; the idea of facility communicating to us that of descent, in the same manner as descent produces a facility?</p>

This aspiring progress of the imagination suits the present disposition of the mind; and the difficulty, instead of extinguishing its vigour and alacrity, has the contrary effect, of sustaining and encreasing it.

This difficulty, when join'd with a small distance, interrupts and weakens the fancy: But has a contrary effect in a great removal. The mind, elevated by the vastness of its object, is still farther elevated by the difficulty of the conception; and being oblig'd every moment to renew its efforts in the transition from one part of time to another, feels a more vigorous and sublime disposition, than in a transition thro' the parts of space, where the ideas How along with easiness and facility. In this disposition, the imagination, passing, as is usual, from the consideration of the distance to the view of the distant objects, gives us a proportionable veneration for it; and this is the reason why all the relicts of antiquity are so precious in our eyes, and appear more valuable than what is brought even from the remotest parts of the world.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be improper, before we leave this subject of the will, to resume, in a few words, all that has been said concerning it, in order to set the whole more distinctly before the eyes of the reader. What we commonly understand by <i class="calibre10">passion</i> is a violent and sensible emotion of mind, when any good or evil is presented, or any object, which, by the original formation of our faculties, is fitted to excite an appetite. By <i class="calibre10">reason</i> we mean affections of the very same kind with the former; but such as operate more calmly, and cause no disorder in the temper: Which tranquillity leads us into a mistake concerning them, and causes us to regard them as conclusions only of our intellectual faculties. Both the <i class="calibre10">causes</i> and <i class="calibre10">efforts</i> of these violent and calm passions are pretty variable, and depend, in a great measure, on the peculiar temper and disposition of every individual. Generally speaking, the violent passions have a more powerful influence on the will; tho' 'tis often found, that the calm ones, when corroborated by reflection, and seconded by resolution, are able to control them in their most furious movements. What makes this whole affair more uncertain, is, that a calm passion may easily be chang'd into a violent one, either by a change of temper, or of the circumstances and situation of the object, as by the borrowing of force from any attendant passion, by custom, or by exciting the imagination. Upon the whole, this struggle of passion and of reason, as it is call'd, diversifies human life, and makes men so different not only from each other, but also from themselves in different times. Philosophy can only account for a few of the greater and more sensible events of this war; but must leave all the smaller and more delicate revolutions, as dependent on principles too line and minute for her comprehension.</p>

The imagination is extreme quick and agile; but the passions are slow and restive: For which reason, when any object is presented, that affords a variety of views to the one, and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion, but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other. According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the passion of joy or sorrow predominates in the composition: Because the nature of probability is to cast a superior number of views or chances on one side; or, which is the same thing, a superior number of returns of one passion; or since the dispers'd passions are collected into one, a superior degree of that passion. That is, in other words, the grief and joy being intermingled with each other, by means of the contrary views of the imagination, produce by their union the passions of hope and fear.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Upon this head there may be started a very curious question conceding that contrariety of passions, which is our present subject. 'Tis observable, that where the objects of contrary passions are presented at once, beside the encrease of the predominant passion (which has been already explain'd, and commonly arises at their first shock or rencounter) it sometimes happens, that both the passions exist successively, and by short intervals; sometimes, that they destroy each other, and neither of them takes place; and sometimes that both of them remain united in the mind. It may, therefore, be ask'd, by what theory we can explain these variations, and to what general principle we can reduce them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">When the contrary passions arise from objects entirely different, they take place alternately, the want of relation in the ideas separating the impressions from each other, and preventing their opposition. Thus when a man is afflicted for the loss of a law-suit, and joyful for the birth of a son, the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object, with whatever celerity it may perform this motion, can scarcely temper the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a state of indifference.</p>

Contrary passions are not capable of destroying each other, except when their contrary movements exactly encounter, and are opposite in their direction, as well as in the sensation they produce. This exact encounter depends upon the relations of those ideas, from which they are deriv'd, and is more or less perfect, according to the degrees of the relation. In the case of probability the contrary chances are so far related, that they determine concerning the existence or nonexistence of the same object. But this relation is far from being perfect; since some of the chances lie on the side of existence, and others on that of non-existence; which are objects altogether incompatible. Tis impossible by one steady view to survey the opposite chances, and the events dependent on them; but 'tis necessary, that the imagination shou'd run alternately from the one to the other. Each view of the imagination produces its peculiar passion, which decays away by degrees, and is follow'd by a sensible vibration after the stroke. The incompatibility of the views keeps the passions from shocking in a direct line, if that expression may be a1low'd; and yet their relation is sufficient to mingle their fainter emotions. 'Tis after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different mixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their imperfect union and conjunction.</p>

The influence of the relations of ideas is plainly seen in this whole affair. If the objects of the contrary passions be totally different, the passions are like two opposite liquors in different bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be intimately connected, the passions are like an <i class="calibre10">alcali</i> and an <i class="calibre10">acid</i>, which, being mingled, destroy each other. If the relation be more imperfect, and consists in the contradictory views of the same object, the passions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and incorporate.</p>

Throw in a superior degree of probability to the side of grief you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over the composition, and tincture it into fear. Encrease the probability, and by that means the grief, the fear prevails still more and more, till at last it runs insensibly, as the joy continually diminishes, into pure grief, after you have brought it to this situation, diminish the grief, after the same manner that you encreas'd it; by diminishing the probability on that side, and you'll see the passion clear every moment, 'till it changes insensibly into hope; which again runs, after the same manner, by slow degrees, into joy, as you encrease that part of the composition by the encrease of the probability.

The most obvious conclusion from this is, that human nature is in general pusilanimous; since upon the sudden appearance of any object we immediately conclude it to be an evil, and without waiting till we can examine its nature, whether it be good or bad, are at first affected with fear. This I say is the most obvious conclusion; but upon farther examination we shall find that the phænomenon is otherwise to be accounted for. The suddenness and strangeness of an appearance naturally excite a commotion in the mind, like every thing for which we are not prepar'd, and to which we are not accustom'd. This commotion, again, naturally produces a curiosity or inquisitiveness, which being very violent, from the strong and sudden impulse of the object, becomes uneasy, and resembles in its fluctuation and uncertainty, the sensation of fear or the mix'd passions of grief and joy. This image of fear naturally converts into the thing itself, and gives us a real apprehension of evil, as the mind always forms its judgments more from its present disposition than from the nature of its objects.</p>

'Twill therefore be proper, before we leave this subject, to bestow a few reflections on that passion, and shew its origin in human nature. 'Tis an affection of so peculiar a kind, that 'twoud have been impossible to have treated of it under any of those heads, which we have examin'd, without danger of obscurity and confusion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Truth is of two kinds, consisting either in the discovery of the proportions of ideas, consider'd as such, or in the conformity of our ideas of objects to their real existence. 'Tis certain, that the former species of truth, is not desir'd merely as truth, and that 'tis not the justness of our conclusions, which alone gives the pleasure. For these conclusions are equally just, when we discover the equality of two bodies by a pair of compasses, as when we learn it by a mathematical demonstration; and tho' in the one case the proofs be demonstrative, and in the other only sensible, yet generally speaking, the mind acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other. And in an arithmetical operation, where both the truth and the assurance are of the same nature, as in the most profound algebraical problem, the pleasure is very inconsiderable, if rather it does not degenerate into pain: Which is an evident proof, that the satisfaction, which we sometimes receive from the discovery of truth, proceeds not from it, merely as such, but only as endow'd with certain qualities.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The first and most considerable circumstance requisite to render truth agreeable, is the genius and capacity, which is employ'd in its invention and discovery. What is easy and obvious is never valu'd; and even what is <i class="calibre10">in itself</i> difficult, if we come to the knowledge of it without difficulty, and without any stretch of thought or judgment, is but little regarded. We love to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians; but shou'd receive small entertainment from a person, who shou'd barely inform us of the proportions of lines and angles, tho' we repos'd the utmost confidence both in his judgment and veracity. In this case 'tis sufficient to have ears to learn the truth. We never are oblig'd to fix our attention or exert our genius; which of all other exercises of the mind is the most pleasant and agreeable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' the exercise of genius be the principal source of that satisfaction we receive from the sciences, yet I doubt, if it be alone sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment. The truth we discover must also be of some importance. 'Tis easy to multiply algebraical problems to infinity, nor is there any end in the discovery of the proportions of conic sections; tho' few mathematicians take any pleasure in these researches, but turn their thoughts to what is more useful and important. Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us? The difficulty on this head arises from hence, that many philosophers have consum'd their time, have destroy'd their health, and neglected their fortune, in the search of such truths, as they esteem'd important and useful to the world, tho' it appear'd from their whole conduct and behaviour, that they were not endow'd with any share of public spirit, nor had any concern for the interests of mankind. Were they convinc'd, that their discoveries were of no consequence, they wou'd entirely lose all relish for their studies, and that tho' the consequences be entirely indifferent to them; which seems to be a contradiction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To remove this contradiction, we must consider, that there are certain desires and inclinations, which go no farther than the imagination, and are rather the faint shadows and images of passions, than any real affections. Thus, suppose a man, who takes a survey of the fortifications of any city; considers their strength and advantages, natural or acquir'd; observes the disposition and contrivance of the bastions, ramparts, mines, and other military works; 'tis plain, that in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their ends, he will receive a suitable pleasure and satisfaction. This pleasure, as it arises from the utility, not the form of the objects, can be no other than a sympathy with the inhabitants, for whose security all this art is employ'd; tho' 'tis possible, that this person, as a stranger or an enemy, may in his heart have no kindness for them, or may even entertain a hatred against them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may indeed be objected, that such a remote sympathy is a very slight foundation for a passion, and that so much industry and application, as we frequently observe in philosophers, can never be deriv'd from so inconsiderable an original. But here I return to what I have already remark'd, that the pleasure of study consists chiefly in the action of the mind. and the exercise of the genius and understanding in discovery or comprehension of any truth. If the importance of the truth be requisite to compleat the pleasure, 'tis not on account of any considerable addition, which of itself it brings to our enjoyment, but only because 'tis, in some measure, requisite to fix our attention. When we are careless and inattentive, the same action of the understanding has no effect upon us, nor is able to convey any of that satisfaction, which arises from it, when we are in another disposition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But beside the action of the mind, which is the principal foundation of the pleasure, there is likewise requir'd a degree of success in the attainment of the end, or the discovery of that truth we examine. Upon this head I shall make a general remark, which may be useful on many occasions, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that where the mind pursues any end with passion; tho' that passion be not deriv'd originally from the end, but merely from the action and pursuit; yet by the natural course of the affections, we acquire a concern for the end itself, and are uneasy under any disappointment we meet with in the pursuit of it. This proceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the passions above-mention'd.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate all this by a similar instance, I shall observe, that there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other, than those of hunting and philosophy, whatever disproportion may at first sight appear betwixt them. 'Tis evident, that the pleasure of hunting consists in the action of the mind and body; the motion, the attention, the difficulty, and the uncertainty. 'Tis evident likewise, that these actions must be attended with an idea of utility, in order to their having any effect upon us. A man of the greatest fortune, and the farthest remov'd from avarice, tho' he takes a pleasure in hunting after partridges and pheasants, feels no satisfaction in shooting crows and magpies; and that because he considers the first as fit for the table, and the other as entirely useless. Here 'tis certain, that the utility or importance of itself causes no real passion, but is only requisite to support the imagination; and the same person, who over-looks a ten times greater profit in any other subject, is pleas'd to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers, after having employ'd several hours in hunting after them. To make the parallel betwixt hunting and philosophy more compleat, we may observe, that tho' in both cases the end of our action may in itself be despis'd, yet in the heat of the action we acquire such an attention to this end, that we are very uneasy under any disappointments, and are sorry when we either miss our game, or fall into any error in our reasoning.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">If we want another parallel to these affections, we may consider the passion of gaming, which affords a pleasure from the same principles as hunting and philosophy. It has been remark'd, that the pleasure of gaming arises not from interest alone; since many leave a sure gain for this entertainment: Neither is it deriv'd from the game alone; since the same persons have no satisfaction, when they play for nothing: But proceeds from both these causes united, tho' separately they have no effect. 'Tis here, as in certain chymical preparations, where the mixture of two clear and transparent liquids produces a third, which is opaque and colour'd.</p>

Our attention being once engag'd, the difficulty, variety, and sudden reverses of fortune, still farther interest us; and 'tis from that concern our satisfaction arises. Human life is so tiresome a scene, and men generally are of such indolent dispositions, that whatever amuses them, tho' by a passion mixt with pain, does in the main give them sensible pleasure. And this pleasure is here encreas'd by the nature of the objects, which being sensible, and of a narrow compass, are enter'd into with facility, and are agreeable to the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The same theory, that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra, may be extended to morals, politics, natural philosophy, and other studies, where we consider not the abstract relations of ideas, but their real connexions and existence. But beside the love of knowledge. which displays itself in the sciences, there is a certain curiosity implanted in human nature, which is a passion deriv'd from a quite different principle. Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours, tho' their interest be no way concern'd in them, and they must entirely depend on others for their information; in which case there is no room for study or application. Let us search for the reason of this phænomenon.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been prov'd at large, that the influence of belief is at once to inliven and infix any idea in the imagination, and prevent all kind of hesitation and uncertainty about it. Both these circumstances are advantageous. By the vivacity of the idea we interest the fancy, and produce, tho' in a lesser degree, the same pleasure, which arises from a moderate passion. As the vivacity of the idea gives pleasure, so its certainty prevents uneasiness, by fixing one particular idea in the mind, and keeping it from wavering in the choice of its objects. 'Tis a quality of human nature, which is conspicuous on many occasions, and is common both to the mind and body, that too sudden and violent a change is unpleasant to us, and that however any objects may in themselves be indifferent, yet their alteration gives uneasiness. As 'tis the nature of doubt to cause a variation in the thought, and transport us suddenly from one idea to another, it must of consequence be the occasion of pain. This pain chiefly takes place, where interest, relation, or the greatness and novelty of any event interests us in it. 'Tis not every matter of fact, of which we have a curiosity to be inform'd; neither are they such only as we have an interest to know. 'Tis sudicient if the idea strikes on us with such force, and concerns us so nearly, as to give us an uneasiness in its instability and inconstancy. A stranger, when he arrives first at any town, may be entirely indifferent about knowing the history and adventures of the inhabitants; but as he becomes farther acquainted with them, and has liv'd any considerable time among them, he acquires the same curiosity as the natives. When we are reading the history of a nation, we may have an ardent desire of clearing up any doubt or difficulty, that occurs in it; but become careless in such researches, when the ideas of these events are, in a great measure, obliterated.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning, that it may silence, without convincing an antagonist, and requires the same intense study to make us sensible of its force, that was at first requisite for its invention. When we leave our closet, and engage in the common affairs of life, its conclusions seem to vanish, like the phantoms of the night on the appearance of the morning; and 'tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we had attain'd with difficulty. This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of reasoning, where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first propositions, and where we often lose sight of all the most receiv'd maxims, either of philosophy or common life. I am not, however, without hopes, that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances; and that our reasonings concerning <i class="calibre10">morals</i> will corroborate whatever has been said concerning the <i class="calibre10">understanding</i> and the <i class="calibre10">passions</i>. Morality is a subject that interests us above all others: We fancy the peace of society to be at stake in every decision concerning it; and 'tis evident, that this concern must make our speculations appear more real and solid, than where the subject is, in a great measure, indifferent to ns. What affects us, we conclude can never be a chimera; and as our passion is engag'd on the one side or the other, we naturally think that the question lies within human comprehension; which, in other cases of this nature, we are apt to entertain some doubt of. Without this advantage I never should have ventur'd upon a third volume of such abstruse philosophy, in an age, wherein the greatest part of men seem agreed to convert reading into an amusement, and to reject every thing that requires any considerable degree of attention to be comprehended.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been observ'd, that reason, in a strict and philosophical sense, can have an influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it excites a passion by informing us of the existence of something which is a proper object of it; or when it discovers the connexion of causes and effects, so as to afford us means of exerting any passion. These are the only kinds of judgment, which can accompany our actions, or can be said to produce them in any manner; and it must be allow'd, that these judgments may often be false and erroneous. A person may be affected with passion, by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an object, which has no tendency to produce either of these sensations, or which produces the contrary to what is imagin'd. A person may also take false measures for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct, instead of forwarding the execution of any project. These false judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be said to render them unreasonable, in a figurative and improper way of speaking. But tho' this be acknowledge'd, 'tis easy to observe, that these errors are so far from being the source of all immorality, that they are commonly very innocent, and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fall into them. They extend not beyond a mistake of <i class="calibre10">fact</i>, which moralists have not generally suppos'd criminal, as being perfectly involuntary. I am more to be lamented than blam'd, if I am mistaken with regard to the influence of objects in producing pain or pleasure, or if I know not the proper means of satisfying my desires. No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral character. A fruit, for instance, that is really disagreeable, appears to me at a distance, and thro' mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious. Here is one error. I choose certain means of reaching this fruit, which are not proper for my end. Here is a second error; nor is there any third one, which can ever possibly enter into our reasonings concerning actions. I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been?

For as the very essence of morality is suppos'd to consist in an agreement or disagreement to reason, the other circumstances are entirely arbitrary, and can never either bestow on any action the character of virtuous or vicious, or deprive it of that character.

'Tis certain, that an action, on many occasions, may give rise to false conclusions in others; and that a person, who thro' a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine with my neighbour's wife, may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my own. In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood; only with this difference, which is material, that I perform not the action with any intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another, but merely to satisfy my lust and passion. It causes, however, a mistake and false judgment by accident; and the falshood of its effects may be ascribed, by some odd figurative way of speaking, to the action itself.

This consequence is evident. As the operations of human understanding divide themselves into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of fact; were virtue discover'd by the understanding; it must be an object of one of these operations, nor is there any third operation of the understanding, which can discover it. There has been an opinion very industriously propagated by certain philosophers, that morality is susceptible of demonstration; and tho' no one has ever been able to advance a single step in those demonstrations; yet 'tis taken for granted, that this science may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra. Upon this supposition, vice and virtue must consist in some relations; since 'tis allow'd on all hands, that no matter of fact is capable of being demonstrated. Let us, therefore, begin with examining this hypothesis, and endeavour, if possible, to fix those moral qualities, which have been so long the objects of our fruitless researches.

For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations, if these relations cou'd belong to internal actions consider'd singly, it wou'd follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent of our situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if these moral relations cou'd be apply'd to external objects, it wou'd follow, that even inanimate beings wou'd be susceptible of moral beauty and deformity. Now it seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can be discover'd betwixt our passions, volitions and actions, compared to external objects, which relation might not belong either to these passions and volitions, or to these external objects, compar'd among <i class="calibre10">themselves</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But it will be still more difficult to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">second</i> condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the principles of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, 'tis not only suppos'd, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the same, when consider'd by every rational creature, but their effects are also suppos'd to be necessarily the same; and 'tis concluded they have no less, or rather a greater, influence in directing the will of the deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species. These two particulars are evidently distinct. 'Tis one thing to know virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws, <i class="calibre10">obligatory</i> on every rational mind, 'tis not sufficient to shew the relations upon which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt the relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so necessary, that in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have its influence; tho' the difference betwixt these minds be in other respects immense and infinite. Now besides what I have already prov'd, that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any action; besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in treating of the understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect, such as this is suppos'd to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the simple consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe, consider'd in themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each other. 'Tis only by experience we learn their influence and connexion; and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience. Thus it will be impossible to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">first</i> condition required to the system of eternal rational measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible to shew those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded: And 'tis as impossible to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">second</i> condition; because we cannot prove <i class="calibre10">a priori</i>, that these relations, if they really existed and were perceiv'd, wou'd be universally forcible and obligatory.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But to make these general reflections more clear and convincing, we may illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death. This is acknowledge'd by all mankind, philosophers as well as the people; the question only arises among philosophers, whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be discover'd by demonstrative reasoning, or be felt by an internal sense, and by means of some sentiment, which the reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This question will soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the same relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas, and the discovery of their relations; and if the same relations have different characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters are not discover' d merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to this trial, let us chuse any inanimate object, such as an oak or elm; and let us suppose, that by the dropping of its seed, it produces a sapling below it, which springing up by degrees, at last overtops and destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this instance there be wanting any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude? Is not the one tree the cause of the other's existence; and the latter the cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a child murders his parent? 'Tis not sufficient to reply, that a choice or will is wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give rise to any <i class="calibre10">different</i> relations, but is only the cause from which the action is deriv'd; and consequently produces the <i class="calibre10">same</i> relations, that in the oak or elm arise from some other principles. 'Tis a will or choice, that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of matter and motion, that determine a sapling to destroy the oak, from which it sprung. Here then the same relations have different causes; but still the relations are the same: And as their discovery is not in both cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion does not arise from such a discovery.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But to chuse an instance, still more resembling; I would fain ask any one, why incest in the human species is criminal, and why the very same action, and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and deformity? If it be answer'd, that this action is innocent in animals, because they have not reason sufficient to discover its turpitude; but that man, being endow'd with that faculty, which <i class="calibre10">ought</i> to restrain him to his duty, the same action instantly becomes criminal to him; should this be said, I would reply, that this is evidently arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this turpitude, the turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the decisions of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect. According to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and appetite, and will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the same virtues and vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human creatures. All the difference is, that our superior reason may serve to discover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame or praise: But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these moral distinctions, and a being, which depends only on the will and appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be distinguish'd from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the same relations, with respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore wou'd also be susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality consisted in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality, but can never hinder these duties from existing; since they must antecedently exist, in order to their being perceiv'd. Reason must find them, and can never produce them. This argument deserves to be weigh'd, as being, in my opinion, entirely decisive.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nor does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any relations, that are the objects of science; but if examin'd, will prove with equal certainty, that it consists not in any <i class="calibre10">matter of fact</i>, which can be discover'd by the understanding. This is the <i class="calibre10">second</i> part of our argument; and if it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of reason. But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason? Take any action allow'd to be vicious: Wilful murder, for instance. Examine it in all lights, and see if you can find that matter of fact, or real existence, which you call <i class="calibre10">vice</i>. In which-ever way you take it, you find only certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object. You never can find it, till you turn your reflection into your own breast, and find a sentiment of disapprobation, which arises in you, towards this action. Here is a matter of fact; but 'tis the object of feeling, not of reason. It lies in yourself, not in the object. So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compar'd to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind: And this discovery in morals, like that other in physics, is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the speculative sciences; tho', like that too, it has little or no influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us more, than our own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may, perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, <i class="calibre10">is</i>, and <i class="calibre10">is not</i>, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an <i class="calibre10">ought</i>, or an <i class="calibre10">ought not</i>. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this <i class="calibre10">ought</i>, or <i class="calibre10">ought not</i>, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv'd by reason.</p>

Our decisions concerning moral rectitude and depravity are evidently perceptions; and as all perceptions are either impressions or ideas, the exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the other. Morality, therefore, is more properly felt than judg'd of; tho' this feeling or sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle, that we are apt to confound it with an idea, according to our common custom of taking all things for the same, which have any near resemblance to each other.</p>

There is no spectacle so fair and beautiful as a noble and generous action; nor any which gives us more abhorrence than one that is cruel and treacherous. No enjoyment equals the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be oblig'd to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn.

An action, or sentiment, or character is virtuous or vicious; why? because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind. In giving a reason, therefore, for the pleasure or uneasiness, we sufficiently explain the vice or virtue. To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to <i class="calibre10">feel</i> a satisfaction of a particular kind from the contemplation of a character. The very <i class="calibre10">feeling</i> constitutes our praise or admiration. We go no farther; nor do we enquire into the cause of the satisfaction. We do not infer a character to be virtuous, because it pleases: But in feeling that it pleases after such a particular manner, we in effect feel that it is virtuous.

		<p class="block_6 en">I have objected to the system, which establishes eternal rational measures of right and wrong, that 'tis impossible to shew, in the actions of reasonable creatures, any relations, which are not found in external objects; and therefore, if morality always attended these relations, 'twere possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or vicious. Now it may, in like manner, be objected to the present system, that if virtue and vice be determin'd by pleasure and pain, these qualities must, in every case, arise from the sensations; and consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite a satisfaction or uneasiness. But tho' this objection seems to be the very same, it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in the other. For, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, 'tis evident, that under the term <i class="calibre10">pleasure</i>, we comprehend sensations, which are very different from each other, and which have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite to make them be express'd by the same abstract term. A good composition of music and a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and what is more, their goodness is determin'd merely by the pleasure. But shall we say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or sentiments of any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as the satisfaction is different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them from being confounded, and makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not to the other. Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain, which arises from characters and actions, of that <i class="calibre10">peculiar</i> kind, which makes us praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us; but may still command our esteem and respect. 'Tis only when a character is considered in general, without reference to our particular interest, that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally good or evil. 'Tis true, those sentiments, from interest and morals, are apt to be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness. But this hinders not, but that the sentiments are, in themselves, distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from these illusions. In like manner, tho' 'tis certain a musical voice is nothing but one that naturally gives a <i class="calibre10">particular</i> kind of pleasure; yet 'tis difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an enemy is agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear, who has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise to what deserves it.</p>

Pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the passion. Now virtue and vice are attended with these circumstances. They must necessarily be plac'd either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure or uneasiness; and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from inanimate objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is, perhaps, the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind.</p>

For in the first sense of the word, Nature, as opposed to miracles, both vice and virtue are equally natural; and in the second sense, as oppos'd to what is unusual, perhaps virtue will be found to be the most unnatural. At least it must be own'd, that heroic virtue, being as unusual, is as little natural as the most brutal barbarity. As to the third sense of the word, 'tis certain, that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of nature. For however it may be disputed, whether the notion of a merit or demerit in certain actions be natural or artificial, 'tis evident, that the actions themselves are artificial, and are perform'd with a certain design and intention; otherwise they cou'd never be rank'd under any of these denominations.

From this principle I conclude, that the first virtuous motive, which bestows a merit on any action, can never be a regard to the virtue of that action, but must be some other natural motive or principle. To suppose, that the mere regard to the virtue of the action, may be the first motive, which produc'd the action, and render'd it virtuous, is to reason in a circle. Before we can have such a regard, the action must be really virtuous; and this virtue must be deriv'd from some virtuous motive: And consequently the virtuous motive must be different from the regard to the virtue of the action. A virtuous motive is requisite to render an action virtuous. An action must be virtuous, before we em have a regard to its virtue.

When any virtuous motive or principle is common in human nature, a person, who feels his heart devoid of that motive, may hate himself upon that account, and may perform the action without the motive, from a certain sense of duty, in order to acquire by practice, that virtuous principle, or at least, to disguise to himself, as much as possible, his want of it. A man that really feels no gratitude in his temper, is still pleas'd to perform grateful actions, and thinks he has, by that means, fulfill'd his duty. Actions are at first only consider'd as signs of motives: But 'tis usual, in this case, as in all others, to fix our attention on the signs, and neglect, in some measure, the thing signify'd. But tho', on some occasions, a person may perform an action merely out of regard to its moral obligation, yet still this supposes in human nature some distinct principles, which are capable of producing the action, and whose moral beauty renders the action meritorious.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now to apply all this to the present case; I suppose a person to have lent me a sum of money, on condition that it be restor'd in a few days; and also suppose, that after the expiration of the term agreed on, he demands the sum: I ask, <i class="calibre10">What reason or motive have I to restore the money?</i> It will, perhaps, be said, that my regard to justice, and abhorrence of villainy and knavery, are sufficient reasons for me, if I have the least grain of honesty, or sense of duty and obligation.

For 'tis a plain fallacy to say, that a virtuous motive is requisite to render an action honest, and at the same time that a regard to the honesty is the motive of the action. We can never have a regard to the virtue of an action, unless the action be antecedently virtuous. No action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a virtuous motive.

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, it may be affirm'd, that there is no such passion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, of services, or of relation to ourself. 'Tis true, there is no human, and indeed no sensible, creature, whose happiness or misery does not, in some measure, affect us, when brought near to us, and represented in lively colours: But this proceeds merely from sympathy, and is no proof of such an universal affection to mankind, since this concern extends itself beyond our own species. An affection betwixt the sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature; and this passion not only appears in its peculiar symptoms, but also in inflaming every other principle of affection, and raising a stronger love from beauty, wit, kindness, than what wou'd otherwise flow from them. Were there an universal love among all human creatures, it wou'd appear after the same manner. Any degree of a good quality wou'd cause a stronger affection than the same degree of a bad quality wou'd cause hatred; contrary to what we find by experience. Men's tempers are different, and some have a propensity to the tender, and others to the rougher, affections: But in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is nothing but the object both of love and hatred, and requires some other cause, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas, may excite these passions. In vain wou'd we endeavour to elude this hypothesis. There are no phænomena that point out any such kind affection to men, independent of their merit, and every other circumstance. We love company in general; but 'tis as we love any other amusement. An <i class="calibre10">Englishman</i> in <i class="calibre10">Italy</i> is a friend: A <i class="calibre10">European</i> in <i class="calibre10">China</i>; and perhaps a man wou'd be belov'd as such, were we to meet him in the moon.

Tis according to their general force in human nature, that we blame or praise. In judging of the beauty of animal bodies, we always carry in our eye the economy of a certain species; and where the limbs and features observe that proportion, which is common to the species, we pronounce them handsome and beautiful. In like manner we always consider the natural and usual force of the passions, when we determine concerning vice and virtue; and if the passions depart very much from the common measures on either side, they are always disapprove'd as vicious. A man naturally loves his children better than his nephews, his nephews better than his cousins, his cousins better than strangers, where every thing else is equal.

By society all his infirmities are compensated; and tho' in that situation his wants multiply every moment upon him, yet his abilities are still more augmented, and leave him in every respect more satisfied and happy, than 'tis possible for him, in his savage and solitary condition, ever to become. When every individual person labours a-part, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labour being employ'd in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery.

Most fortunately, therefore, there is conjoin'd to those necessities, whose remedies are remote and obscure, another necessity, which having a present and more obvious remedy, may justly be regarded as the first and original principle of human society. This necessity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the sexes, which unites them together, and preserves their union, till a new tye takes place in their concern for their common offspring. This new concern becomes also a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a more numerous society; where the parents govern by the advantage of their superior strength and wisdom, and at the same time are restrain'd in the exercise of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their children. In a little time, custom and habit operating on the tender minds of the children, makes them sensible of the advantages, which they may reap from society, as well as fashions them by degrees for it, by rubbing off those rough corners and untoward affections, which prevent their coalition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">For it must be confest, that however the circumstances of human nature may render an union necessary, and however those passions of lust and natural affection may seem to render it unavoidable; yet there are other particulars in our <i class="calibre10">natural temper</i>, and in our <i class="calibre10">outward circumstances</i>, which are very incommodious, and are even contrary to the requisite conjunction. Among the former, we may justly esteem our <i class="calibre10">selfishness</i> to be the most considerable. I am sensible, that, generally speaking, the representations of this quality have been carried much too far; and that the descriptions, which certain philosophers delight so much to form of mankind in this particular, are as wide of nature as any accounts of monsters, which we meet with in fables and romances. So far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves, I am of opinion, that tho' it be rare to meet with one, who loves any single person better than himself; yet 'tis as rare to meet with one, in whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not over-balance all the selfish. Consult common experience: Do you not see, that tho' the whole expence of the family be generally under the direction of the master of it, yet there are few that do not bestow the largest part of their fortunes on the pleasures of their wives, and the education of their children, reserving the smallest portion for their own proper use and entertainment. This is what we may observe concerning such as have those endearing ties; and may presume, that the case would be the same with others, were they plac'd in a like situation. But tho' this generosity must be acknowledge'd to the honour of human nature, we may at the same time remark, that so noble an affection, instead of fitting men for large societies, is almost as contrary to them, as the most narrow selfishness. For while each person loves himself better than any other single person, and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance, this must necessarily produce an opposition of passions, and a consequent opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the new-establish'd union.</p>

The last only are both expos'd to the violence of others, and may be transfer'd without suffering any loss or alteration; while at the same time, there is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one's desires and necessities.

The idea of justice can never serve to this purpose, or be taken for a natural principle, capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards each other. That virtue, as it is now understood, wou'd never have been dream'd of among rude and savage men. For the notion of injury or injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against some other person: And as every immorality is deriv'd from some defect or unsoundness of the passions, and as this defect must be judg'd of, in a great measure, from the ordinary course of nature in the constitution of the mind; 'twill be easy to know, whether we be guilty of any immorality, with regard to others, by considering the natural, and usual force of those several affections, which are directed towards them. Now it appears, that in the original frame of our mind, our strongest attention is confin'd to ourselves; our next is extended to our relations and acquaintance; and 'tis only the weakest which reaches to strangers and indifferent persons. This partiality, then, and unequal affection, must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct in society, but even on our ideas of vice and virtue; so as to make us regard any remarkable transgression of such a degree of partiality, either by too great an enlargement, or contraction of the affections, as vicious and immoral. This we may observe in our common judgments concerning actions, where we blame a person, who either centers all his affections in his family, or is so regardless of them, as, in any opposition of interest, to give the preference to a stranger, or mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural uncultivated ideas of morality, instead of providing a remedy for the partiality of our affections, do rather conform themselves to that partiality, and give it an additional force and influence.</p>

This can be done after no other manner, than by a convention enter'd into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry. By this means, every one knows what he may safely possess; and the passions are restrain'd in their partial and contradictory motions. Nor is such a restraint contrary to these passions; for if so, it cou'd never be enter'd into, nor maintain'd; but it is only contrary to their heedless and impetuous movement. Instead of departing from our own interest, or from that of our nearest friends, by abstaining from the possessions of others, we cannot better consult both these interests, than by such a convention; because it is by that means we maintain society, which is so necessary to their well-being and subsistence, as well as to our own.</p>

Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded.

A man's property is some object related to him. This relation is not natural, but moral, and founded on justice. 'Tis very preposterous, therefore, to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully comprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of men. The origin of justice explains that of property. The same artifice gives rise to both. As our first and most natural sentiment of morals is founded on the nature of our passions, and gives the preference to ourselves and friends, above strangers; 'tis impossible there can be naturally any such thing as a fix'd right or property, while the opposite passions of men impel them in contrary directions, and are not restrain'd by any convention or agreement.</p>

Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this purpose; and as to the other passions, they rather inflame this avidity, when we observe, that the larger our possessions are, the more ability we have of gratifying all our appetites. There is no passion, therefore, capable of controlling the interested affection, but the very affection itself, by an alteration of its direction. Now this alteration must necessarily take place upon the least reflection; since 'tis evident, that the passion is much better satisfy'd by its restraint, than by its liberty, and that in preserving society, we make much greater advances in the acquiring possessions, than in the solitary and forlorn condition, which must follow upon violence and an universal licence. The question, therefore, concerning the wickedness or goodness of human nature, enters not in the least into that other question concerning the origin of society; nor is there any thing to be consider'd but the degrees of men's sagacity or folly.

But however philosophers may have been bewilder'd in those speculations, poets have been guided more infallibly, by a certain taste or common instinct, which in most kinds of reasoning goes farther than any of that art and philosophy, with which we have been yet acquainted. They easily perceiv'd, if every man had a tender regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires, that the jealousy of interest, which justice supposes, could no longer have place; nor would there be any occasion for those distinctions and limits of property and possession, which at present are in use among mankind. Encrease to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues, and more valuable blessings. The selfishness of men is animated by the few possessions we have, in proportion to our wants; and 'tis to restrain this selfishness, that men have been ob1ig'd to separate themselves from the community, and to distinguish betwixt their own goods and those of others.</p>

'Twas therefore a concern for our own, and the publick interest, which made us establish the laws of justice; and nothing can be more certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas, which gives us this concern, but our impressions and sentiments, without which every thing in nature is perfectly indifferent to us, and can never in the least affect us.

		<p class="block_6 en">To make this more evident, consider, that tho' the rules of justice are establish'd merely by interest, their connexion with interest is somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observ'd on other occasions. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to <i class="calibre10">public interest</i>; and were it to stand alone, without being follow'd by other acts, may, in itse1£ be very prejudicial to society. When a man of merit, of a beneficent disposition, restores a great fortune to a miser, or a seditious bigot, he has acted justly and laudably, but the public is a real sufferer. Nor is every single act of justice, consider'd apart, more conducive to private interest, than to public; and 'tis easily conceiv'd how a man may impoverish himself by a signal instance of integrity, and have reason to wish, that with regard to that single act, the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe. But however single acts of justice may be contrary, either to public or private interest, 'tis certain, that the whole plan or scheme is highly conducive, or indeed absolutely requisite, both to the support of society, and the well-being of every individual. 'Tis impossible to separate the good from the ill. Property must be stable, and must be fix'd by general rules. Tho' in one instance the public be a sufferer, this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady prosecution of the rule, and by the peace and order, which it establishes in society. And even every individual person must find himself a gainer, on balancing the account; since, without justice, society must immediately dissolve, and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos'd in society. When therefore men have had experience enough to observe, that whatever may be the consequence of any single act of justice, perform'd by a single person, yet the whole system of actions, concurr'd in by the whole society, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part; it is not long before justice and property take place. Every member of society is sensible of this interest: Every one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the resolution he has taken of squaring his actions by it, on condition that others will do the same. No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform an act of justice, who has the first opportunity. This becomes an example to others. And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of convention or agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, suppos'd to be common to all, and where every single act is perform'd in expectation that others are to perform the like. Without such a convention, no one wou'd ever have dream'd, that there was such a virtue as justice, or have been induc'd to conform his actions to it. Taking any single act, my justice may be pernicious in every respect; and 'tis only upon the supposition, that others are to imitate my example, that I can be induc'd to embrace that virtue; since nothing but this combination can render justice advantageous, or afford me any motives to conform my self to its rules.</p>

The <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation to justice, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> interest, has been fully explain'd; but as to the moral obligation, or the sentiment of right and wrong, 'twill first be requisite to examine the natural virtues, before we can give a full and satisfactory account of it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">After men have found by experience, that their selfishness and confin'd generosity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate them for society; and at the same time have observ'd, that society is necessary to the satisfaction of those very passions, they are naturally induc'd to lay themselves under the restraint of such rules, as may render their commerce more safe and commodious. To the imposition then, and observance of these rules, both in general, and in every particular instance, they are at first induc'd only by a regard to interest; and this motive, on the first formation of society, is sufficiently strong and forcible. But when society has become numerous, and has encreas'd to a tribe or nation, this interest is more remote; nor do men so readily perceive, that disorder and confusion follow upon every breach of these rules, as in a more narrow and contracted society. But tho' in our own actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest, which we have in maintaining order, and may follow a lesser and more present interest, we never fail to observe the prejudice we receive, either mediately or immediately, from the injustice of others; as not being in that case either blinded by passion, or byass'd by any contrary temptation. Nay when the injustice is so distant from us, as no way to affect our interest, it still displeases us; because we consider it as prejudicial to human society, and pernicious to every one that approaches the person guilty of it. We partake of their uneasiness by <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>; and as every thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions, upon the general survey, is call'd Vice, and whatever produces satisfaction, in the same manner, is denominated Virtue; this is the reason why the sense of moral good and evil follows upon justice and injustice. And tho' this sense, in the present case, be deriv'd only from contemplating the actions of others, yet we fail not to extend it even to our own actions. The general rule reaches beyond those instances, from which it arose; while at the same time we naturally <i class="calibre10">sympathize</i> with others in the sentiments they entertain of us. <i class="calibre10">Thus self-interest is the original motive to the</i> establishment <i class="calibre10">of justice: but a</i> sympathy <i class="calibre10">with public interest is the source of the</i> moral approbation, <i class="calibre10">which attends that virtue</i>.</p>

This, no doubt, must have its effect; but nothing can be more evident, than that the matter has been carry'd too far by certain writers on morals, who seem to have employ'd their utmost efforts to extirpate all sense of virtue from among mankind. Any artifice of politicians may assist nature in the producing of those sentiments, which she suggests to us, and may even on some occasions, produce alone an approbation or esteem for any particular action; but 'tis impossible it should be the sole cause of the distinction we make betwixt vice and virtue. For if nature did not aid us in this particular, twou'd be in vain for politicians to talk of <i class="calibre10">honourable</i> or <i class="calibre10">dishonourable</i>, <i class="calibre10">praiseworthy</i> or <i class="calibre10">blameable</i>.

I first consider men in their savage and solitary condition; and suppose, that being sensible of the misery of that state, and foreseeing the advantages that wou'd result from society, they seek each other's company, and make an offer of mutual protection and assistance. I also suppose, that they are endow'd with such sagacity as immediately to perceive, that the chief impediment to this project of society and partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their natural temper; to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the stability of possession, and for mutual restraint and forbearance. I am sensible, that this method of proceeding is not altogether natural; but besides that I here only suppose those reflections to be form'd at once, which in fact arise insensibly and by degrees; besides this, I say, 'tis very possible, that several persons, being by different accidents separated from the societies, to which they formerly belong'd, may be oblig'd to form a new society among themselves; in which case they are entirely in the situation above-mention'd.</p>

This relation, then, is a species of cause and effect; and as property is nothing but a stable possession; deriv'd from the rules of justice, or the conventions of men, 'tis to be consider'd as the same species of relation. But here we may observe, that as the power of using any object becomes more or less certain, according as the interruptions we may meet with are more or less probable; and as this probability may increase by insensible degrees; 'tis in many cases impossible to determine when possession begins or ends; nor is there any certain standard, by which we can decide such controversies. A wild boar, that falls into our snares, is deem'd to be in our possession, if it be impossible for him to escape. But what do we mean by impossible? How do we separate this impossibility from an improbability? And how distinguish that exactly from a probability?

The relation of fitness or suitableness ought never to enter into consideration, in distributing the properties of mankind; but we must govern ourselves by rules, which are more general in their application, and more free from doubt and uncertainty. Of this kind is present possession upon the first establishment of society; and afterwards occupation, prescription, accession, and succession. As these depend very much on chance, they must frequently prove contradictory both to men's wants and desires; and persons and possessions must often be very ill adjusted. This is a grand inconvenience, which calls for a remedy. To apply one directly, and allow every man to seize by violence what he judges to be fit for him, wou'd destroy society; and therefore the rules of justice seek some medium betwixt a rigid stability, and this changeable and uncertain adjustment. But there is no medium better than that obvious one, that possession and property shou'd always be stable, except when the proprietor consents to bestow them on some other person. This rule can have no ill consequence, in occasioning wars and dissentions; since the proprietor's consent, who alone is concern'd, is taken along in the alienation: And it may serve to many good purposes in adjusting property to persons. Different parts of the earth produce different commodities; and not only so, but different men both are by nature fitted for different employments, and attain to greater perfection in any one, when they confine themselves to it alone. All this requires a mutual exchange and commerce; for which reason the translation of property by consent is founded on a law of nature, as well as its stability without such a consent.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far is determin'd by a plain utility and interest. But perhaps 'tis from more trivial reasons, that delivery, or a sensible transference of the object is commonly requir'd by civil laws, and also by the laws of nature, according to most me if authors, as a requisite circumstance in the translation of property. The property of an object, when taken for something real, without any reference to morality, or the sentiments of the mind, is a quality perfectly insensible, and even inconceivable; nor can we form any distinct notion, either of its stability or translation. This imperfection of our ideas is less sensibly felt with regard to its stability, as it engages less our attention, and is easily past over by the mind, without any scrupulous examination. But as the translation of property from one person to another is a more remarkable event, the defect of our ideas becomes more sensible on that occasion, and obliges us to turn ourselves on every side in search of some remedy. Now as nothing more enlivens any idea than a present impression, and a relation betwixt that impression and the idea; 'tis natural for us to seek some false light from this quarter. In order to aid the imagination in conceiving the transference of property, we take the sensible object, and actually transfer its possession to the person, on whom we wou'd bestow the property. The suppos'd resemblance of the actions, and the presence of this sensible delivery, deceive the mind, and make it fancy, that it conceives the mysterious transition of the property. And that this explication of the matter is just, appears hence, that men have invented a symbolical delivery, to satisfy the fancy, where the real one is impracticable. Thus the giving the keys of a granary is understood to be the delivery of the corn contain'd in it: The giving of stone and earth represents the delivery of a mannor. This is a kind of superstitious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature, resembling the Roman catholic superstitions in religion. As the Roman catholics represent the inconceivable mysteries of the Christian religion, and render them more present to the mind, by a taper, or habit, or grimace, which is suppos'd to resemble them; so lawyers and moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason, and have endeavour'd by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the transference of property by consent.</p>

If promises be natural and intelligible, there must be some act of the mind attending these words, <i class="calibre10">I promise</i>; and on this act of the mind must the obligation depend.

Neither is it the <i class="calibre10">willing</i> of that action, which we promise to perform: For a promise always regards some future time, and the will has an influence only on present actions. It follows, therefore, that since the act of the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces its obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any particular performance, it must necessarily be the <i class="calibre10">willing</i> of that <i class="calibre10">obligation</i>, which arises from the promise. Nor is this only a conclusion of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves, when we say that we are bound by our own consent, and that the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure. The only question, then, is, whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind, and such an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into, whose ideas are not confounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of language.</p>

A change of the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment; and a creation of a new obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise. But 'tis certain we can naturally no more change our own sentiments, than the motions of the heavens; nor by a single act of our will, that is, by a promise, render any action agreeable or disagreeable, moral or immoral; which, without that act, wou'd have produc'd contrary impressions, or have been endow'd with different qualities. It wou'd be absurd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new sentiment of pain or pleasure; nor is it possible, that men cou'd naturally fall into so gross an absurdity.

		<p class="block_6 en">The same truth may be prov'd still more evidently by that reasoning, which prov'd justice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action can be requir'd of us as our duty, unless there be implanted in human nature some actuating passion or motive, capable of producing the action. This motive cannot be the sense of duty. A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obligation: And where an action is not requir'd by any natural passion, it cannot be requir'd by any natural obligation; since it may be omitted without proving any defect or imperfection in the mind and temper, and consequently without any vice. Now 'tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises had no moral obligation, we never shou'd feel any inclination to observe them. This is not the case with the natural virtues. Tho' there was no obligation to relieve the miserable, our humanity wou'd lead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the omission arises from its being a proof, that we want the natural sentiments of humanity.

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to discover these necessities and interests, we must consider the same qualities of human nature, which we have already found to give rise to the preceding laws of society. Men being naturally selfish, or endow'd only with a confin'd generosity, they are not easily induc'd to perform any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to some reciprocal advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by such a performance. Now as it frequently happens, that these mutual performances cannot be finish'd at the same instant, 'tis necessary, that one party be contented to remain in uncertainty, and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a return of kindness. But so much corruption is there among men, that, generally speaking, this becomes but a slender security; and as the benefactor is here suppos'd to bestow his favours with a view to self interest, this both takes off from the obligation, and sets an example of selfishness, which is the true mother of ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural course of our passions and inclinations, we shou'd perform but few actions for the advantage of others, from disinterested views; because we are naturally very limited in our kindness and affection: And we shou'd perform as few of that kind, out of a regard to interest; because we cannot depend upon their gratitude. Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a manner lost among mankind, and every one reduc'd to his own skill and industry for his well-being and subsistence. The invention of the law of nature, concerning the <i class="calibre10">stability</i> of possession, has already render'd men tolerable to each other; that of the <i class="calibre10">transference</i> of property and possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous: But still these laws of nature, however strictly observ'd, are not sufficient to render them so serviceable to each other, as by nature they are fitted to become. Tho' possession be stable, men may often reap but small advantage from it, while they are possess'd of a greater quantity of any species of goods than they have occasion for, and at the same time suffer by the want of others. The <i class="calibre10">transference</i> of property, which is the proper remedy for this inconvenience, cannot remedy it entirely; because it can only take place with regard to such objects as are <i class="calibre10">present</i> and <i class="calibre10">individual</i>, but not to such as are <i class="calibre10">absent</i> or <i class="calibre10">general</i>. One cannot transfer the property of a particular house, twenty leagues distant; because the consent cannot be attended with delivery, which is a requisite circumstance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten bushels of corn, or five hogsheads of wine, by the mere expression and consent; because these are only general terms, and have no direct relation to any particular heap of corn, or barrels of wine. Besides, the commerce of mankind is not confin'd to the barter of commodities, but may extend to services and actions, which we may exchange to our mutual interest and advantage. Your corn is ripe today; mine will be so to-morrow. 'Tis profitable for us both, that I shou'd labour with you to-day, and that you shou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a return, I know I shou'd be disappointed, and that I shou'd in vain depend upon you gratitude. Here then I leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security.</p>

And indeed, did the success of their designs depend upon their success in correcting the selfishness and ingratitude of men, they wou'd never make any progress, unless aided by omnipotence, which is alone able to new-mould the human mind, and change its character in such fundamental articles. All they can pretend to, is, to give a new direction to those natural passions, and teach us that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I learn to do a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness; because I forsee, that he will return my service, in expectation of another of the same kind, and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good offices with me or with others. And accordingly, after I have serv'd him, and he is in possession of the advantage arising from my action, he is induc'd to perform his part, as foreseeing the consequences of his refusal.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this self-interested commerce of men begins to take place, and to predominate in society, it does not entirely abolish the more generous and noble intercourse of friendship and good offices. I may still do services to such persons as I love, and am more particularly acquainted with, without any prospect of advantage; and they may make me a return in the same manner, without any view but that of recompensing my past services. In order, therefore, to distinguish those two different sorts of commerce, the interested and the disinterested, there is a <i class="calibre10">certain form of words</i> invented for the former, by which we bind ourselves to the performance of any action. This form of words constitutes what we call a promise, which is the sanction of the interested commerce of mankind. When a man says <i class="calibre10">he promises any thing</i>, he in effect expresses a <i class="calibre10">resolution</i> of performing it; and along with that, by making use of this <i class="calibre10">form of words</i>, subjects himself to the penalty of never being trusted again in case of failure. A resolution is the natural act of the mind, which promises express: But were there no more than a resolution in the case, promises wou'd only declare our former motives, and wou'd not create any new motive or obligation. They are the conventions of men, which create a new motive, when experience has taught us, that human affairs wou'd be conducted much more for mutual advantage, were there certain <i class="calibre10">symbols</i> or <i class="calibre10">signs</i> instituted, by which we might give each other security of our conduct in any particular incident. After these signs are instituted, whoever uses them is immediately bound by his interest to execute his engagements, and must never expect to be trusted any more, if he refuse to perform what he promis'd.</p>

There needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us perceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest experience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each individual perceives the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he immediately performs his part of any contract, as being assur'd, that they will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter into a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to be true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this concert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in the faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to other members of the society. This immediately causes that interest to operate upon them; and interest is the <i class="calibre10">first</i> obligation to the performance of promises.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Afterwards a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and becomes a new obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the performance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in the abstinence from the property of others. <i class="calibre10">Public interest, education</i>, and <i class="calibre10">the artifices of politicians</i>, have the same effect in both cases. The difficulties, that occur to us, in supposing a moral obligation to attend promises, we either surmount or elude. For instance; the expression of a resolution is not commonly suppos'd to be obligatory; and we cannot readily conceive how the making use of a certain form of words shou'd be able to cause any material difference. Here, therefore, we <i class="calibre10">feign</i> a new act of the mind, which we call the <i class="calibre10">willing</i> an obligation; and on this we suppose the morality to depend.

		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections concerning that will, which is suppos'd to enter into a promise, and to cause its obligation. 'Tis evident, that the will alone is never suppos'd to cause the obligation, but must be express'd by words or signs, in order to impose a tye upon any man. The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, tho' he secretly give a different direction to his intention, and with-hold himself both from a resolution, and from willing an obligation. But tho' the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one, who shou'd make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any intention of binding himself wou'd not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he knows its meaning, yet if he uses it in jest only, and with such signs as shew evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself, he wou'd not lie under any obligation of performance; but 'tis necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases. where the signs are of a different kind from those of deceit. All these contradictions are easily accounted for, if the obligation of promises be merely a human invention for the convenience of society; but will never be explain'd, if it be something <i class="calibre10">real</i> and <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, arising from any action of the mind or body.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I shall farther observe, 'that since every new promise imposes a new obligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new obligation arises from his will; 'tis one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagin'd, and may even be compar'd to <i class="calibre10">transubstantiation</i>, or <i class="calibre10">holy orders<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-267" title="73">73</a></sup></i>, where a certain form of words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even of a human creature. But tho' these mysteries be so far alike, 'tis very remarkable, that they differ widely in other particulars, and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof of the difference of their origins. As the obligation of promises is an invention for the interest of society, 'tis warp'd into as many different forms as that interest requires, and even runs into direct contradictions, rather than lose sight of its object. But as those other monstrous doctrines are merely priestly inventions, and have no public interest in view, they are less disturb'd in their progress by new obstacles; and it must be own'd, that, after the first absurdity, they follow more directly the current of reason and good sense. Theologians clearly perceiv'd, that the external form of words, being mere sound, require an intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this intention being once consider'd as a requisite circumstance, its absence must equally prevent the effect, whether avow'd or conceal'd, whether sincere or deceitful. Accordingly they have commonly determin'd, that the intention of the priest makes the sacrament, and that when he secretly withdraws his intention, he is highly criminal in himself; but still destroys the baptism, or communion, or holy orders. The terrible consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place; as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine, with regard to promises, have prevented that doctrine from establishing itse1f. Men are always more concern'd about the present life than the future; and are apt to think the smallest evil, which regards the former, more important than the greatest, which regards the latter.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may draw the same conclusion, concerning the origin of promises, from the <i class="calibre10">force</i>, which is suppos'd to invalidate all contracts, and to free us from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promises have no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the convenience and advantage of society. If we consider aright of the matter, force is not essentially different from any other motive of hope or fear, which may induce us to engage our word, and lay ourselves under any obligation. A man, dangerously wounded, who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him, wou'd certainly be bound to performance; tho' the case be not so much different from that of one, who promises a sum to a robber, as to produce so great a difference in our sentiments of morality, if these sentiments were not built entirely on public interest and convenience.</p>

Whatever restraint they may impose on the passions of men, they are the real offspring of those passions, and are only a more artful and more refin'd way of satisfying them. Nothing is more vigilant and inventive than our passions; and nothing is more obvious, than the convention for the observance of these rules. Nature has, therefore, trusted this affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not plac'd in the mind any peculiar original principles, to determine us to a set of actions, into which the other principles of our frame and constitution were sufficient to lead us. And to convince us the more fully of this truth, we may here stop a moment, and from a review of the preceding reasoning's may draw some new arguments, to prove that those laws, however necessary, are entirely artificial, and of human invention; and consequently that justice is an artificial, and not a natural virtue.</p>

'Tis evident property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the object. For these may continue invariably the same, while the property changes. Property, therefore, must consist in some relation of the object. But 'tis not in its relation with regard to other external and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably the same, while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But 'tis not the external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of property. For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects, or with regard to brute creatures; tho' in those cases it forms no property. 'Tis, therefore, in some internal relation, that the property consists; that is, in some influence, which the external relations of the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation, which we call <i class="calibre10">occupation</i> or first possession, is not of itself imagin'd to be the property of the object, but only to cause its property. Now 'tis evident, this external relation causes nothing in external objects, and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor. These actions are properly what we call <i class="calibre10">justice</i>; and consequently 'tis on that virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue on the property.</p>

Thus the restoring a man's goods to him is consider'd as virtuous, not because nature has annex'd a certain sentiment of pleasure to such a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but because she has annex'd that sentiment to such a conduct, with regard to those external objects, of which others have had the first or long possession, or which they have receiv'd by the consent of those, who have had first or long possession. If nature has given us no such sentiment, there is not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as property. Now, tho' it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and accurate consideration of the present subject, that nature has annex'd no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I may leave as little room for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few more arguments to confirm my opinion.</p>

'Tis self-love which is their real origin; and as the self-love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these several interested passions are oblig'd to adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and behaviour. This system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each individual, is of course advantageous to the public; tho' it be not intended for that purpose by the inventors.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">II. In the second place we may observe, that all kinds of vice and virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing principle. For whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue, 'tis certain, that rights, and obligations, and property, admit of no such insensible gradation, but that a man either has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely oblig'd to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obligation. However civil laws may talk of a perfect <i class="calibre10">dominion</i>, and of an imperfect, 'tis easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which has no foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, tho' but for a day, has as full a right to make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its proprietor has to make use of it any other day; and 'tis evident, that however the use may be bounded in time or degree, the right itself is not susceptible of any such gradation, but is absolute and entire, so far as it extends Accordingly we may observe, that this right both arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man entirely acquires the property of any object by occupation, or the consent of the proprietor; and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations. Since, therefore, this is the case with regard to property, and right, and obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and injustice? After whatever manner you answer this question, you run into inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice admit of degree, and run insensibly into each other, you expressly contradict the foregoing position, that obligation and property are not susceptible of such a gradation. These depend entirely upon justice and injustice, and follow them in all their variations. Where the justice is entire, the property is also entire: Where the justice is imperfect, the property must also be imperfect; And <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i>, if the property admit of no such variations, they must also be incompatible with justice. If you assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that justice and injustice are not susceptible of degrees, you in effect assert, that they are not <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> either vicious or virtuous; since vice and virtue, moral good and evil, and indeed all <i class="calibre10">natural</i> qualities, run insensibly into each other, and are, on many occasions, undistinguishable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">And here it may be worth while to observe, that tho' abstract reasoning, and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this position, <i class="calibre10">that property, and right, and obligation admit not of degrees</i>, yet in our common and negligent way of thinking, we find great difficulty to entertain that opinion, and do even <i class="calibre10">secretly</i> embrace the contrary principle. An object must either be in the possession of one person or another. An action must either be perform'd or not. The necessity there is of choosing one side in these dilemmas, and the impossibility there often is of finding any just medium, oblige us, when we reflect on the matter, to acknowledge, that all property and obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we consider the origin of property and obligation, and find that they depend on public utility, and sometimes on the propensities of the imagination, which are seldom entire on any side; we are naturally inclin'd to imagine, that these moral relations admit of an insensible gradation. Hence it is, that in references, where the consent of the parties leave the referees entire masters of the subject, they commonly discover so much equity and justice on both sides, as induces them to strike a medium, and divide the difference betwixt the parties. Civil judges, who have not this liberty, but are oblig'd to give a decisive sentence on some one side, are often at a loss how to determine, and are necessitated to proceed on the most frivolous reasons in the world. Half rights and obligations, which seem so natural in common life, are perfect absurdities in their tribunal; for which reason they are often oblig'd to take half arguments for whole ones, in order to terminate the affair one way or other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">III. The third argument of this kind I shall make use of may be explain'd thus. If we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules; but acts on most occasions as it is determin'd by its present motives and inclination. As each action is a particular individual event, it must proceed from particular principles, and from our immediate situation within ourselves, and with respect to the rest of the universe. If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form something like <i class="calibre10">general rules</i> for our conduct, tis easy to observe, that these rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since, therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may conclude, that the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be deriv'd from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination. No action can be either morally good or evil, unless there be some natural passion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and tis evident, that the morality must be susceptible of all the same variations, which are natural to the passion. Here are two persons, who dispute for an estate; of whom one is rich, a fool, and a bachelor; the other poor, a man of sense, and has a numerous family: The first is my enemy; the second my friend. Whether I be actuated in this affair by a view to public or private interest, by friendship or enmity, I must be induc'd to do my utmost to procure the estate to the latter. Nor wou'd any consideration of the right and property of the persons be able to restrain me, were I actuated only by natural motives, without any combination or convention with others. For as all property depends on morality; and as all morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions; and as these again are only directed by particular motives; 'tis evident, such a partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality, and cou'd never be a violation of property. Were men, therefore, to take the liberty of acting with regard to the laws of society, as they do in every other affair, they wou'd conduct themselves, on most occasions, by particular judgments, and wou'd take into consideration the characters and circumstances of the persons, as well as the general nature of the question. But 'tis easy to observe, that this wou'd produce an infinite confusion in human society, and that the avidity and partiality of men wou'd quickly bring disorder into the world, if not restrain'd by some general and inflexible principles. 'Twas, therefore, with a view to this inconvenience, that men have establish'd those principles, and have agreed to restrain themselves by general rules, which are unchangeable by spite and favour, and by particular views of private or public interest. These rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain purpose, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature, which accommodate themselves to circumstances, and have no stated invariable method of operation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nor do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. I see evidently, that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible rules in his conduct with others, he considers certain objects as their property, which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable. But no proposition can be more evident, than that property is perfectly unintelligible without first supposing justice and injustice; and that these virtues and vices are as unintelligible, unless we have motives, independent of the morality, to impel us to just actions, and deter us from unjust ones. Let those motives, therefore, be what they will, they must accommodate themselves to circumstances, and must admit of all the variations, which human affairs, in their incessant revolutions, are susceptible of. They are consequently a very improper foundation for such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of [justice?]; and 'tis evident these laws can only be deriv'd from human conventions, when men have perceiv'd the disorders that result from following their natural and variable principles.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Upon the whole, then, we are to consider this distinction betwixt justice and injustice, as having two different foundations, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that of <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, when men observe, that 'tis impossible to live in society without restraining themselves by certain rules; and that of <i class="calibre10">morality</i>, when this interest is once observ'd, and men receive a pleasure from the view of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and an uneasiness from such as are contrary to it. 'Tis the voluntary convention and artifice of men, which makes the first interest take place; and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be consider'd as <i class="calibre10">artificial</i>. After that interest is once establish'd and acknowledge'd, the sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows <i class="calibre10">naturally</i>, and of itself; tho' 'tis certain, that it is also augmented by a new <i class="calibre10">artifice</i>, and that the public instructions of politicians, and the private education of parents, contribute to the giving us a sense of honour and duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others.</p>

'Tis no less certain, that 'tis impossible for men to consult their interest in so effectual a manner, as by an universal and inflexible observance of the rules of justice, by which alone they can preserve society, and keep themselves from falling into that wretched and savage condition, which is commonly represented as the <i class="calibre10">state of nature</i>. And as this interest, which all men have in the upholding of society, and the observation of the rules of justice, is great, so is it palpable and evident, even to the most rude and uncultivated of human race; and 'tis almost impossible for any one, who has had experience of society, to be mistaken in this particular. Since, therefore, men are so sincerely attach'd to their interest, and their interest is so much concern'd in the observance of justice, and this interest is so certain and avow'd; it may be ask'd, how any disorder can ever arise in, society, and what principle there is in human nature so <i class="calibre10">powerful</i> as to overcome so strong a passion, or so <i class="calibre10">violent</i> as to obscure so clear a knowledge?</p>

What strikes upon them with a strong and lively idea commonly prevails above what lies in a more obscure light; and it must be a great superiority of value, that is able to compensate this advantage. Now as every thing, that is contiguous to us, either in space or time, strikes upon us with such an idea, it a proportional effect on the will and passions, and commonly operates with more force than any object, that lies in a more distant and obscure light. Tho' we may be fully convinc'd, that the latter object excels the former, we are not able to regulate our actions by this judgment; but yield to the solicitations of our passions, which always plead in favour of whatever is near and contiguous.</p>

They are, however, never the less real for being remote; and as all men are, in some degree, subject to the same weakness, it necessarily happens, that the violations of equity must become very frequent in society, and the commerce of men, by that means, be render' d very dangerous and uncertain. You have the same propension, that I have, in favour of what is contiguous above what is remote. You are, therefore, naturally carried to commit acts of injustice as well as me. Your example both pushes me forward in this way by imitation, and also affords me a new reason for any breach of equity, by shewing me, that I should be the cully of my integrity, if I alone shou'd impose on myself a severe restraint amidst the licentiousness of others.</p>

'Tis evident such a remedy can never be effectual without correcting this propensity; and as 'tis impossible to change or correct any thing material in our nature, the utmost we can do is to change our circumstances and situation, and render the observance of the laws of justice our nearest interest, and their violation our most remote. But this being impracticable with respect to all mankind, it can only take place with respect to a few, whom we thus immediately interest in the execution of justice. These are the persons, whom we call civil magistrates, kings and their ministers, our governors and rulers, who being indifferent persons to the greatest part of the state, have no interest, or but a remote one, in any act of injustice; and being satisfied with their present condition, and with their part in society, have an immediate interest in every execution of justice, which is so necessary to the upholding of society. Here then is the origin of civil government and society. Men are not able radically to cure, either in themselves or others, that narrowness of soul, which makes them prefer the present to the remote. They cannot change their natures. All they can do is to change their situation, and render the observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons, and its violation their more remote. These persons, then, are not only induc'd to observe those rules in their own conduct, but also to constrain others to a like regularity, and inforce the dictates of equity thro' the whole society. And if it be necessary, they may also interest others more immediately in the execution of justice, and create a number of officers, civil and military, to assist them in their government.</p>

As violent passion hinders men from seeing distinctly the interest they have in an equitable behaviour towards others; so it hinders them from seeing that equity itself, and gives them a remarkable partiality in their own favours. This inconvenience is corrected in the same manner as that above-mention'd.

But government extends farther its beneficial influence; and not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their mutual interest, it often obliges them to make such conventions, and forces them to seek their own advantage, by a concurrence in some common end or purpose. There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value. Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because 'tis easy for them to know each others mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is the abandoning the whole project. But 'tis very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou'd agree in any such action; it being difficult for them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult for them to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence, and wou'd lay the whole burden on others. Political society easily remedies both these inconveniences. Magistrates find an immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their subjects. They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme for the promoting of that interest. And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is commented, tho' not immediately, with the failure of the whole, they prevent that failure, because they find no interest in it, either immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours open'd; ramparts rais'd; canals form'd; fleets equip'd; and armies discipline'd; every where, by the care of government, which, tho' compos'd of men subject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the finest and most subtle inventions imaginable, a composition, which is, in some measure, exempted from all these infirmities.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Though government be an invention very advantageous, and even in some circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind; it is not necessary in all circumstances, nor is it impossible for men to preserve society for some time, without having recourse to such an invention. Men, 'tis true, are always much inclin'd to prefer present interest to distant and remote; nor is it easy for them to resist the temptation of any advantage, that they may immediately enjoy, in apprehension of an evil, that lies at a distance from them: But still this weakness is less conspicuous, where the possessions, and the pleasures of life are few, and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of society. An <i class="calibre10">Indian</i> is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut, or to steal his bow, as being already provided of the same advantages; and as to any superior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting and fishing, 'tis only casual and temporary, and will have but small tendency to disturb society. And so far am I from thinking with some philosophers, that men are utterly incapable of society without government, that I assert the first rudiments of government to arise from quarrels, not among men of the same society, but among those of different societies. A less degree of riches will suffice to this latter effect, than is requisite for the former. Men fear nothing from public war and violence but the resistance they meet with, which, because they share it in common, seems less terrible; and because it comes from strangers, seems less pernicious in its consequences, than when they are expos'd singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them, and without whose society 'tis impossible they can subsist. Now foreign war to a society without government necessarily produces civil war. Throw any considerable goods among men, they instantly fall a quarrelling, while each strives to get possession of what pleases him, without regard to the consequences. In a foreign war the most considerable of all goods, life and limbs, are at stake; and as every one shuns dangerous ports, seizes the best arms, seeks excuse for the slightest wounds, the laws, which may be well enough observ'd, while men were calm, can now no longer take place, when they are in such commotion.</p>

This authority, however, instructs them in the advantages of government, and teaches them to have recourse to it, when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous inventions, their riches and possessions have become so considerable as to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest they have in the preservation of peace and justice. Hence we may give a plausible reason, among others, why all governments are at first monarchical, without any mixture and variety; and why republics arise only from the abuses of monarchy and despotic power. Camps are the true mothers of cities; and as war cannot be administred, by reason of the suddenness of every exigency, without some authority in a single person, the same kind of authority naturally takes place in that civil government, which succeeds the military. And this reason I take to be more natural, than the common one deriv'd from patriarchal government, or the authority of a father, which is said first to take place in one family, and to accustom the members of it to the government of a single person. The state of society without government is one of the most natural states of men, and must subsist with the conjunction of many families, and long after the first generation. Nothing but an encrease of riches and possessions cou'd oblige men to quit it; and so barbarous and uninstructed are all societies on their first formation, that many years must elapse before these can encrease to such a degree, as to disturb men in the enjoyment of peace and concord.</p>

These are, therefore, antecedent to government, and are suppos'd to impose an obligation before the duty of allegiance to civil magistrates has once been thought o£ Nay, I shall go farther, and assert, that government, <i class="calibre10">upon its first establishment</i>, wou'd naturally be suppos'd to derive its obligation from those laws of nature, and, in particular, from that concerning the performance of promises. When men have once perceiv'd the necessity of government to maintain peace, and execute justice, they wou'd naturally assemble together, wou'd chuse magistrates, determine their power, and <i class="calibre10">promise</i> them obedience. As a promise is suppos'd to be a bond or security already in use, and attended with a moral obligation, 'tis to be consider'd as the original sanction of government, and as the source of the first obligation to obedience. This reasoning appears so natural, that it has become the foundation of our fashionable system of politics, and is in a manner the creed of a party amongst us, who pride themselves, with reason, on the soundness of their philosophy, and their liberty of thought. All men, say they, <i class="calibre10">are born free and equal: Government and superiority can only by establish'd by consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are bound to obey their magistrates, only because they promise it; and if they had not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty</i>. This conclusion, however, when carried so far as to comprehend government in all its ages and situations, is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that tho' the duty of allegiance be at first grafted on the obligation of promises, and be for some time supported by that obligation, yet it quickly takes root of itself, and has an original obligation and authority, independent of all contracts. This is a principle of moment, which we must examine with care and attention, before we proceed any farther.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis reasonable for those philosophers, who assert justice to be a natural virtue, and antecedent to human conventions, to resolve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and assert that 'tis our own consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy. For as all government is plainly an invention of men, and the origin of most governments is known in history, 'tis necessary to mount higher, in order to find the source of our political duties, if we wou'd assert them to have any <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation of morality. These philosophers, therefore, quickly observe, that society is as antient as the human species, and those three fundamental laws of nature as antient as society: So that taking advantage of the antiquity, and obscure origin of these laws, they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary inventions of men, and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties, which are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceiv'd in this particular, and having found that <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, as well as <i class="calibre10">civil</i> justice, derives its origin from human conventions, we shall quickly perceive, how fruitless it is to resolve the one into the other, and seek, in the laws of nature, a stronger foundation for our political duties than interest, and human conventions; while these laws themselves are built on the very same foundation. On which ever side we turn this subject, we shall find, that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the same footing, and have the same source both of their <i class="calibre10">first invention</i> and <i class="calibre10">moral obligation</i>. They are contriv'd to remedy like inconveniences, and acquire their moral sanction in the same manner, from their remedying those inconveniences.

		<p class="block_6 en">We have already shewn, that men <i class="calibre10">invented</i> the three fundamental laws of nature, when they observ'd the necessity of society to their mutual subsistence, and found, that 'twas impossible to maintain any correspondence together, without some restraint on their natural appetites. The same self-love, therefore, which renders men so incommodious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of justice, and is the <i class="calibre10">first</i> motive of their observance. But when men have observ'd, that tho' the rules of justice be sufficient to maintain any society, yet 'tis impossible for them, of themselves, to observe those rules, in large and polish'd societies; they establish government, as a new invention to attain their ends, and preserve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more strict execution of justice. So far, therefore, our <i class="calibre10">civil</i> duties are connected with our <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the latter; and that the principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature. In this respect, however, that law of nature, concerning the performance of promises, is only compriz'd along with the rest; and its exact observance is to be consider'd as an effect of the institution of government, and not the obedience to government as an effect of the obligation, of a promise. Tho' the object of our civil duties be the enforcing of our natural, yet the <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-162" id="calibre_link-329" title="74">74</a></sup><i class="calibre10">first</i> motive of the invention, as well as performance of both, is nothing but self-interest: And since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government, from that in the performance of promises, we must also allow of a separate obligation. To obey the civil magistrate is requisite to preserve order and concord in society. To perform promises is requisite to beget mutual trust and confidence in the common offices of life. The ends, as well as the means, are perfectly distinct; nor is the one subordinate to the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">To make this more evident, let us consider, that men will often bind themselves by promises to the performance of what it wou'd have been their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they wou'd give others a fuller security, by super-adding a new obligation of interest to that which they formerly lay under. The interest in the performance of promises, besides its moral obligation, is general, avow'd, and of the last consequence in life. Other interests may be more particular and doubtful; and we are apt to entertain a greater suspicion, that men may indulge their humour, or passion, in acting contrary to them. Here, therefore, promises come naturally in play, and are often requir'd for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing those other interests to be as general and avow'd as the interest in the performance of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing, and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate; without which no government cou'd subsist, nor any peace or order be maintain'd in large societies, where there are so many possessions on the one hand, and so many wants, real or imaginary, on the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach themselves from our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The interest in both is of the very same kind: 'Tis general, avow'd, and prevails in all times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar to itself. We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the possessions of others, into the obligation of a promise, as that of allegiance. The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the other. A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society, than obedience is to civil society or government; nor is the former society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of promises be advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest be general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avow'd, so is the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of interest, each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But 'tis not only the <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligations of interest, which are distinct in promises and allegiance; but also the <i class="calibre10">moral</i> obligations of honour and conscience: Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend in the least upon that of the other. And indeed, if we consider the close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest is always engag'd on the side of obedience to magistracy; and there is nothing but a great present advantage, that can lead us to rebellion, by making us over-look the remote interest, which we have in the preserving of peace and order in society. But tho' a present interest may thus blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true colours, as highly prejudicial to public interest, and to our own in particular. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in considering such seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of vice and moral deformity. 'Tis the same principle, which causes us to disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the breach of promises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because we consider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty to magistrates; because we perceive, that the execution of justice, in the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission to government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate and independant. Tho' there was no such thing as a promise in the world, government wou'd still be necessary in all large and civiliz'd societies; and if promises had only their own proper obligation, without the separate sanction of government, they wou'd have but little efficacy in such societies. This separates the boundaries of our public and private duties, and shews that the latter are more dependant on the former, than the former on the latter. <i class="calibre10">Education</i>, and <i class="calibre10">the artifice of politicians</i>, concur to bestow a farther morality on loyalty, and to brand all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy.

		<p class="block_6 en">Lest those arguments shou'd not appear entirely conclusive (as I think they are) I shall have recourse to authority, and shall prove, from the universal consent of mankind, that the obligation of submission to government is not deriv'd from any promise of the subjects. Nor need any one wonder, that tho' I have all along endeavour'd to establish my system on pure reason, and have scarce ever cited the judgment even of philosophers or historians on any article, I shou'd now appeal to popular authority, and oppose the sentiments of the rabble to any philosophical reasoning. For it must be observ'd, that the opinions of men, in this case, carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in a great measure, infallible. The distinction of moral good and evil is founded on the pleasure or pain, which results from the view of any sentiment, or character; and as that pleasure or pain cannot be unknown to the person who feels it, it follows, <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-163" id="calibre_link-388" title="75">75</a></sup>that there is just so much vice or virtue in any character, as every one places in it, and that 'tis impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken. And tho' our judgments conceding the <i class="calibre10">origin</i> of any vice or virtue, be not so certain as those concerning their <i class="calibre10">degrees</i>; yet, since the question in this case regards not any philosophical origin of an obligation, but a plain matter of fact, 'tis not easily conceiv'd how we can fall into an error. A man, who acknowledges himself to be bound to another, for a certain sum, must certainly know whether it be by his own bond, or that of his father; whether it be of his mere goodwill, or for money lent him; and under what conditions, and for what purposes he has bound himself. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral obligation to submit to government, because every one thinks so; it must be as certain, that this obligation arises not from a promise; since no one, whose judgment has not been led astray by too strict adherence to a system of philosophy, has ever yet dreamt of ascribing it to that origin. Neither magistrates nor subjects have form'd this idea of our civil duties.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We find, that magistrates are so far from deriving their authority, and the obligation to obedience in their subjects, from the foundation of a promise or original contract, that they conceal, as far as possible, from their people, especially from the vulgar, that they have their origin from thence. Were this the sanction of government, our rulers wou'd never receive it tacitly, which is the utmost that can be pretended; since what is given tacitly and insensibly can never have such influence on mankind, as what is perform'd expressly and openly. A tacit promise is, where the will is signified by other more diffuse signs than those of speech; but a will there must certainly be in the case, and that can never escape the person's notice, who exerted it, however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest part of the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers, or promis'd to obey them, they wou'd be inclin'd to think very strangely of you; and wou'd certainly reply, that the affair depended not on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. In consequence of this opinion, we frequently see them imagine such persons to be their natural rulers, as are at that time depriv'd of all power and authority, and whom no man, however foolish, wou'd voluntarily chuse; and this merely because they are in that line, which rul'd before, and in that degree of it, which us'd to succeed; tho perhaps in so distant a period, that scarce any man alive cou'd ever have given any promise of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over such as these, because they never consented to it, and wou'd esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety? We find by experience, that it punishes them very freely for what it calls treason and rebellion, which, it seems. according to this system, reduces itself to common injustice. If you say, that by dwelling in its dominions, they in effect consented to the establish'd government; I answer, that this can only be, where they think the affair depends on their choice, which few or none, beside those philosophers, have ever yet imagin'd. It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel, that the first act he perform'd, after he came to years of discretion, was to levy war against the sovereign of the state; and that while he was a child he cou'd not bind himself by his own consent, and having become a man, show'd plainly, by the first act he perform'd, that he had no design to impose on himself any obligation to obedience. We find, on the contrary, that civil laws punish this crime at the same age as any other, which is criminal, of itself, without our consent; that is, when the person is come to the full use of reason: Whereas to this crime they ought in justice to allow some intermediate time, in which a tacit consent at least might be suppos'd. To which we may add, that a man living under an absolute government, wou'd owe it no allegiance; since, by its very nature, it depends not on consent. But as that is as <i class="calibre10">natural</i> and <i class="calibre10">common</i> a government as any, it must certainly occasion some obligation; and 'tis plain from experience, that men, who are subjected to it, do always think so. This is a clear proof, that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be deriv'd from our consent or promise; and a farther proof is, that when our promise is upon any account expressly engag'd, we always distinguish exactly betwixt the two obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other, than in a repetition of the same promise. Where no promise is given, a man looks not on his faith as broken in private matters, upon account of rebellion; but keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate. As the uniting of them was thought by these philosophers a very subtile invention, this is a convincing proof, that 'tis not a true one; since no man can either give a promise, or be restrain'd by its sanction and obligation unknown to himself.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Those political writers, who have had recourse to a promise, or original contract, as the source of our allegiance to government, intended to establish a principle, which is perfectly just and reasonable; tho' the reasoning, upon which they endeavour'd to establish it, was fallacious and sophistical. They wou'd prove, that our submission to government admits of exceptions, and that an egregious tyranny in the rulers is sufficient to free the subjects from all ties of allegiance. Since men enter into society, say they, and submit themselves to government, by their free and voluntary consent, they must have in view certain advantages, which they propose to reap from it, and for which they are contented to resign their native liberty. There is, therefore. something mutual engag'd on the part of the magistrate, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> protection and security; and 'tis only by the hopes he affords of these advantages, that he can ever persuade men to submit to him. But when instead of protection and security, they meet with tyranny and oppression, they are free'd from their promises, (as happens in all conditional contracts) and return to that state of liberty, which preceded the institution of government. Men wou'd never be so foolish as to enter into such engagements as shou'd turn entirely to the advantage of others, without any view of bettering their own condition. Whoever proposes to draw any profit from our submission, must engage himself, either expressly or tacitly. to make us reap some advantage from his authority; nor ought he to expect, that without the performance of his part we will ever continue in obedience.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I repeat it: This conclusion is just, tho' the principles be erroneous; and I flatter myself, that I can establish the same conclusion on more reasonable principles. I shall not take such a compass, in establishing our political duties, as to assert, that men perceive the advantages of government; that they institute government with a view to those advantages; that this institution requires a promise of obedience: which imposes a moral obligation to a certain degree, but being conditional, ceases to be binding, whenever the other contracting party performs not his part of the engagement. I perceive, that a promise itself arises entirely from human conventions, and is invented with a view to a certain interest. I seek, therefore, some such interest more immediately connected with government, and which may be at once the original motive to its institution, and the source of our obedience to it. This interest I find to consist in the security and protection, which we enjoy in political society, and which we can never attain, when perfectly free and independent. As interest, therefore, is the immediate sanction of government, the one can have no longer being than the other; and whenever the civil magistrate carries his oppression so far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable, we are no longer bound to submit to it. The cause ceases; the effect must cease also.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far the conclusion is immediate and direct, concerning the natural obligation which we have to allegiance. As to the moral obligation, we may observe, that the maxim wou'd here be false, that <i class="calibre10">when the cause ceases, the effect must cease also</i>. For there is a principle of human nature, which we have frequently taken notice of, that men are mightily addicted to <i class="calibre10">general rules</i>, and that we often carry our maxims beyond those reasons, which first induc'd us to establish them. Where cases are similar in many circumstances, we are apt to put them on the same footing, without considering, that they differ in the most material circumstances, and that the resemblance is more apparent than real. It may, therefore, be thought, that in the case of allegiance our moral obligation of duty will not cease, even tho' the natural obligation of interest, which is its cause, has ceas'd; and that men may be bound by <i class="calibre10">conscience</i> to submit to a tyrannical government against their own and the public interest. And indeed, to the force of this argument I so far submit, as to acknowledge, that general rules commonly extend beyond the principles, on which they are founded; and that we seldom make any exception to them, unless that exception have the qualities of a general rule, and be founded on very numerous and common instances. Now this I assert to be entirely the present case. When men submit to the authority of others, 'tis to procure themselves some security against the wickedness and injustice of men, who are perpetually carried, by their unruly passions, and by their present and immediate interest, to the violation of all the laws of society. But as this imperfection is inherent in human nature, we know that it must attend men in all their states and conditions; and that those, whom we chuse for rulers, do not immediately become of a superior nature to the rest of mankind, upon account of their superior power and authority. What we expect from them depends not on a change of their nature but of their situation, when they acquire a more immediate interest in the preservation of order and the execution of justice. But besides that this interest is only more immediate in the execution of justice among their subjects; besides this, I say, we may often expect, from the irregularity of human nature, that they will neglect even this immediate interest, and be transported by their passions into all the excesses of cruelty and ambition. Our general knowledge of human nature, our observation of the past history of mankind, our experience of present times; all these causes must induce us to open the door to exceptions, and must make is conclude, that we may resist the more violent effects of supreme power, without any crime or injustice.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Accordingly we may observe, that this is both the general practice and principle of mankind, and that no nation, that cou'd find any remedy, ever yet suffer'd the cruel ravages of a tyrant, or were blam'd for their resistance. Those who took up arms against <i class="calibre10">Dionysius</i> or <i class="calibre10">Nero</i>, or <i class="calibre10">Philip the second</i>, have the favour of every reader in the perusal of their history; and nothing but the most violent perversion of common sense can ever lead us to condemn them. 'Tis certain, therefore, that in all our notions of morals we never entertain such an absurdity as that of passive obedience, but make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression. The general opinion of mankind has some authority in all cases; but in this of morals 'tis perfectly infallible. Nor is it less infallible, because men cannot distinctly explain the principles, on which it is founded. Few persons can carry on this train of reasoning: 'Government is a mere human invention for the interest of society. Where the tyranny of the governor removes this interest, it also removes the natural obligation to obedience. The moral obligation is founded on the natural, and therefore must cease where <i class="calibre10">that</i> ceases; especially where the subject is such as makes us foresee very many occasions wherein the natural obligation may cease, and causes us to form a kind of general rule for the regulation of our conduct in such occurrences.' But tho' this train of reasoning be too subtile for the vulgar, 'tis certain, that all men have an implicit notion of it, and are sensible, that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public interest; and at the same time, that human nature is so subject to frailties and passions, as may easily pervert this institution, and change their governors into tyrants and public enemies. If the sense of common interest were not our original motive to obedience, I wou'd fain ask, what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to such a submission? Imitation and custom are not sufficient. For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom? There evidently is no other principle than common interest; and if interest first produces obedience to government, the obligation to obedience must cease, whenever the interest ceases, in any great degree, and in a considerable number of instances.</p>

As numerous and civiliz'd societies cannot subsist without government, so government is entirely useless without an exact obedience. We ought always to weigh the advantages, which we reap from authority, against the disadvantages; and by this means we shall become more scrupulous of putting in practice the doctrine of resistance. The common rule requires submission; and 'tis only in cases of grievous tyranny and oppression, that the exception can take place.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since then such a blind submission is commonly due to magistracy, the next question is, <i class="calibre10">to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard as our lawful magistrates?</i> In order to answer this question, let us recollect what we have already establish'd conceding the origin of government and political society. When men have once experience'd the impossibility of preserving any steady order in society, while every one is his own master, and violates or observes the laws of society, according to his present interest or pleasure, they naturally run into the invention of government, and put it out of their own power, as far as possible, to transgress the laws of society. Government, therefore, arises from the voluntary convention of men; and 'tis evident, that the same convention, which establishes government, will also determine the persons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in this particular. And the voluntary consent of men must here have the greater efficacy, that the authority of the magistrate does <i class="calibre10">at first</i> stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects, by which they bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement. The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to a particular person, and makes him the object of their allegiance.</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But when government has been establish'd on this footing for some considerable time, and the separate interest, which we have in submission, has produc'd a separate sentiment of morality, the case is entirely alter'd, and a promise is no longer able to determine the particular magistrate; since it is no longer consider'd as the foundation of government. We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission; and imagine, that such particular persons have a right to command, as we on our part are bound to obey. These notions of right and obligation are deriv'd from nothing but the advantage we reap from government, which gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves, and makes us displeas'd with any instance of it in others. But here 'tis remarkable, that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of government, which is <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, is not admitted to determine the persons, whom we are to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on the footing of a <i class="calibre10">promise</i>. A <i class="calibre10">promise</i> fixes and determines the persons, without any uncertainty: But 'tis evident, that if men were to regulate their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, either public or private, they wou'd involve themselves in endless confusion, and wou'd render all government, in a great measure, ineffectual. The private interest of every one is different; and tho' the public interest in itself be always one and the same, yet it becomes the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different opinions of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore, which causes us to submit to magistracy, makes us renounce itself in the choice of our magistrates, and binds us down to a certain form of government, and to particular persons, without allowing us to aspire to the utmost perfection in either. The case is here the same as in that law of nature conceding the stability of possession. 'Tis highly advantageous, and even absolutely necessary to society, that possession shou'd be stable; and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule: But we find, that were we to follow the same advantage, in assigning particular possessions to particular persons, we shou'd disappoint our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate ourselves by general interests, in modifying the law of nature concerning the stability of possession. Nor need we fear, that our attachment to this law will diminish upon account of the seeming frivolousness of those interests, by which it is determin'd. The impulse of the mind is deriv'd from a very strong interest; and those other more minute interests serve only to direct the motion, without adding any thing to it, or diminishing from it. 'Tis the same case with government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an invention; and this interest is sufficient to make us embrace it with ardour and alacrity; tho' we are oblig'd afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by several considerations, which are not of the same importance, and to chuse our magistrates without having in view any particular advantage from the choice.</p>

'Tis certain, that if we remount to the first origin of every nation, we shall find, that there scarce is any race of kings, or form of a commonwealth, that is not primarily founded on usurpation and rebellion, and whose title is not at first worse than doubtful and uncertain. Time alone gives solidity to their right; and operating gradually on the minds of men, reconciles them to any authority, and makes it seem just and reasonable. Nothing causes any sentiment to have a greater influence upon us than custom, or turns our imagination more strongly to any object. When we have been long accustom'd to obey any set of men, that general instinct or tendency, which we have to suppose a moral obligation attending loyalty, takes easily this direction, and chuses that set of men for its objects.

The royal authority seems to be connected with the young prince even in his father's life-time, by the natural transition of the thought; and still more after his death: So that nothing is more natural than to compleat this union by a new relation, and by putting him actually in possession of what seems so naturally to belong to him.</p>

Hence in some governments of this kind, the choice commonly falls on one or other of the royal family; and in some governments they are all excluded. Those contrary phænomena proceed from the same principle. Where the royal family is excluded, 'tis from a refinement in politics, which makes people sensible of their propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family, and gives them a jealousy of their liberty, lest their new monarch, aided by this propensity, shou'd establish his family, and destroy the freedom of elections for the future.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This leads us to consider the <i class="calibre10">fifth</i> source of authority, viz. <i class="calibre10">positive laws</i>; when the legislature establishes a certain form of government and succession of princes. At first sight it may be thought, that this must resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority. The legislative power, whence the positive law is deriv'd, must either be establish'd by original contract, long possession, present possession, conquest, or succession; and consequently the positive law must derive its force from some of those principles. But here 'tis remarkable, that tho' a positive law can only derive its force from these principles, yet it acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is deriv'd, but loses considerably in the transition; as it is natural to imagine. For instance; a government is establish'd for many centuries on a certain system of laws, forms, and methods of succession. The legislative power, establish'd by this long succession, changes all on a sudden the whole system of government, and introduces a new constitution in its stead. I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound to comply with this alteration, unless it have an evident tendency to the public good: But will think themselves still at liberty to return to the antient government.

There is such an insensible gradation from the most material laws to the most trivial, and from the most antient laws to the most modern, that 'twill be impossible to set bounds to the legislative power, and determine how far it may innovate in the principles of government. That is the work more of imagination and passion than of reason.</p>

In this particular, the study of history confirms the reasonings of true philosophy; which, shewing us the original qualities of human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies in politics as incapable of any decision in most cases, and as entirely subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty. Where the public good does not evidently demand a change; 'tis certain, that the concurrence of all those titles, <i class="calibre10">original contract</i>, <i class="calibre10">long possession, present possession, succession</i>, and <i class="calibre10">positive laws</i>, forms the strongest title to sovereignty, and is justly regarded as sacred and inviolable.

		<p class="block_6 en">But here an <i class="calibre10">English</i> reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous <i class="calibre10">revolution</i>, which has had such a happy influence on our constitution, and has been attended with such mighty consequences. We have already remark'd, that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression, 'tis lawful to take arms even against supreme power; and that as government is a mere human invention for mutual advantage and security, it no longer imposes any obligation, either natural or moral, when once it ceases to have that tendency. But tho' this general principle be authoriz'd by common sense, and the practice of all ages, 'tis certainly impossible for the laws, or even for philosophy, to establish any <i class="calibre10">particular</i> rules, by which we may know when resistance is lawful; and decide all controversies, which may arise on that subject. This may not only happen with regard to supreme power; but 'tis possible, even in some constitutions, where the legislative authority is not lodg'd in one person, that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful, as to oblige the laws to keep silence in this particular. Nor wou'd this silence be an effect only of their <i class="calibre10">respect</i>, but also of their <i class="calibre10">prudence</i>; since 'tis certain, that in the vast variety of circumstances, which occur in all governments, an exercise of power, in so great a magistrate, may at one time be beneficial to the public, which at another time wou'd be pernicious and tyrannical. But notwithstanding this silence of the laws in limited monarchies, 'tis certain, that the people still retain the right of resistance; since 'tis impossible, even in the most despotic governments, to deprive them of it. The same necessity of self-preservation, and the same motive of public good, give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other. And we may farther observe, that in such mix'd governments, the cases, wherein resistance is lawful, must occur much oftener, and greater indulgence be given to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms, than in arbitrary governments. Not only where the chief magistrate enters into measures, in themselves, extremely pernicious to the public, but even when he wou'd encroach on the other parts of the constitution, and extend his power beyond the legal bounds, it is allowable to resist and dethrone him; tho' such resistance and violence may, in the general tenor of the laws, be deem'd unlawful and rebellious. For besides that nothing is more essential to public interest, than the preservation of public liberty; 'tis evident, that if such a mix'd government be once suppos'd to be establish'd, every part or member of the constitution must have a right of self-defence, and of maintaining its antient bounds against the encroachment of every other authority. As matter wou'd have been created in vain, were it depriv'd of a power of resistance, without which no part of it cou'd preserve a distinct existence, and the whole might be crowded up into a single point: So 'tis a gross absurdity to suppose, in any government, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the supreme power is shar'd with the people, without allowing, that 'tis lawful for them to defend their share against every invader. Those, therefore, who wou'd seem to respect our free government, and yet deny the right of resistance, have renounc'd all pretensions to common sense, and do not merit a serious answer.</p>

But shou'd the king, by his unjust practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and despotic power, justly forfeit his legal, it then not only becomes morally lawful and suitable to the nature of political society to dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewise to think, that the remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of excluding his next heir, and of chusing whom they please for his successor. This is founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination. When a king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the same situation, as if the king were remov'd by death; unless by mixing himself in the tyranny, he forfeit it for himself. But tho' this may seem reasonable, we easily comply with the contrary opinion. The deposition of a king, in such a government as ours, is certainly an act beyond all common authority, and an illegal assuming a power for public good, which, in the ordinary course of government, can belong to no member of the constitution. When the public good is so great and so evident as to justify the action, the commendable use of this licence causes us naturally to attribute to the <i class="calibre10">parliament</i> a right of using farther licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once transgressed with approbation, we are not apt to be so strict in confining ourselves precisely within their limits. The mind naturally runs on with any train of action, which it has begun; nor do we commonly make any scruple concerning our duty, after the first action of any kind, which we perform. Thus at the <i class="calibre10">revolution</i>, no one who thought the deposition of the father justifiable, esteem'd themselves to be confin'd to his infant son; tho' had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that time, and had his son, by any accident, been convey'd beyond seas, there is no doubt but a regency wou'd have been appointed till he shou'd come to age, and cou'd be restor'd to his dominions. As the slightest properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people, it shews the wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of such properties, and to chuse the magistrates either in or out of a line, according as the vulgar will most naturally attribute authority and right to them.</p>

Nothing is more usual, tho' nothing may, at first sight, appear more unreasonable, than this way of thinking. Princes often <i class="calibre10">seem</i> to acquire a right from their successors, as well as from their ancestors; and a king, who during his life-time might justly be deem'd an usurper, will be regarded by posterity as a lawful prince, because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on the throne, and entirely change the antient form of government. <i class="calibre10">Julius Cæsar</i> is regarded as the first Roman emperor; while <i class="calibre10">Sylla</i> and <i class="calibre10">Marius</i>, whose titles were really the same as his, are treated as tyrants and usurpers.

		<p class="block_6 en">When civil government has been establish'd over the greatest part of mankind, and different societies have been form'd contiguous to each other, there arises a new set of duties among the neighbouring states, suitable to the nature of that commerce, which they carry on with each other. Political writers tell us, that in every kind of intercourse, a body politic is to be consider'd as one person; and indeed this assertion is so far just, that different nations, as well as private persons, require mutual assistance; at the same time that their selfishness and ambition are perpetual sources of war and discord. But tho' nations in this particular resemble individuals, yet as they are very different in other respects, no wonder they regulate themselves by different maxims, and give rise to a new set of rules, which we call <i class="calibre10">the laws of nations</i>. Under this head we may comprize the sacredness of the persons of ambassadors, the declaration of war, the abstaining from poison'd arms, with other duties of that kind, which are evidently calculated for the commerce, that is peculiar to different societies.</p>

The same interest produces the same effect in both cases. Where possession has no stability, there must be perpetual war. Where property is not transfer'd by consent, there can be no commerce. Where promises are not observ'd, there can be no leagues nor alliances. The advantages, therefore, of peace, commerce, and mutual succour, make us extend to different kingdoms the same notions of justice, which take place among individuals.</p>

'Tis evident this is not to be understood of the lesser <i class="calibre10">extent</i> of public duties and obligations; nor will any one be so extravagant as to assert, that the most solemn treaties ought to have no force among princes. For as princes do actually form treaties among themselves, they must propose some advantage from the execution of them; and the prospect of such advantage for the future must engage them to perform their part, and must establish that law of nature. The meaning, therefore, of this political maxim is, that tho' the morality of princes has the same <i class="calibre10">extent</i>, yet it has not the same <i class="calibre10">force</i> as that of private persons, and may lawfully be transgress'd from a more trivial motive.

This obligation of interest rests not here; but by the necessary course of the passions and sentiments, gives rise to the moral obligation of duty; while we approve of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and disapprove of such as tend to its disturbance. The same <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation of interest takes place among independent kingdoms, and gives rise to the same <i class="calibre10">morality</i>; so that no one of ever so corrupt morals will approve of a prince, who voluntarily, and of his own accord, breaks his word, or violates any treaty. But here we may observe, that tho' the intercourse of different states be advantageous, and even sometimes necessary, yet it is not so necessary nor advantageous as that among individuals, without which 'tis utterly impossible for human nature ever to subsist. Since, therefore, the <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation to justice, among different states, is not so strong as among individuals, the mural obligation, which arises from it, must partake of its weakness; and we must necessarily give a greater indulgence to a prince or minister, who deceives another; than to a private gentleman, who breaks his word of honour.</p>

One may safely affirm, that this proportion finds itself, without any art or study of men; as we may observe on many other occasions. The practice of the world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty, than the most subtile philosophy, which was ever yet invented. And this may serve as a convincing proof, that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation of those moral rules concerning natural and civil justice, and are sensible, that they arise merely from human conventions, and from the interest, which we have in the preservation of peace and order. For otherwise the diminution of the interest wou'd never produce a relaxation of the morality, and reconcile us more easily to any transgression of justice among princes and republics, than in the private commerce of one subject with another.</p>

But in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this restraint, and undergo cheerfully all the fatigues and expences, to which it subjects them, they must believe, that the children are their own, and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object, when they give a loose to love and tenderness. Now if we examine the structure of the human body, we shall find, that this security is very difficult to be attain'd on our part; and that since, in the copulation of the sexes, the principle of generation goes from the man to the woman, an error may easily take place on the side of the former, tho' it be utterly impossible with regard to the latter.

		<p class="block_6 en">Were a philosopher to examine the matter a priori, he wou'd reason after the following manner. Men are induc'd to labour for the maintenance and education of their children, by the persuasion that they are really their own; and therefore 'tis reasonable, and even necessary, to give them some security in this particular. This security cannot consist entirely in the imposing of severe punishments on any transgressions of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; since these public punishments cannot be inflicted without legal proof, which 'tis difficult to meet with in this subject. What restraint, therefore, shall we impose on women, in order to counter-balance so strong a temptation as they have to infidelity? There seems to be no restraint possible, but in the punishment of bad fame or reputation; a punishment, which has a mighty influence on the human mind, and at the same time is inflicted by the world upon surmizes, and conjectures, and proofs, that wou'd never be receiv'd in any court of judicature. In order, therefore, to impose a due restraint on the female sex, we must attach a peculiar degree of shame to their infidelity, above what arises merely from its injustice, and must bestow proportion able praises on their chastity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this be a very strong motive to fidelity, our philosopher wou'd quickly discover, that it wou'd not alone be sufficient to that purpose. All human creatures, especially of the female sex, are apt to over-look remote motives in favour of any present temptation: The temptation is here the strongest imaginable: Its approaches are insensible and seducing: And a woman easily finds, or flatters herself she shall find, certain means of securing her reputation, and preventing all the pernicious consequences of her pleasures. 'Tis necessary, therefore, that, beside the infamy attending such licences, there shou'd be some preceding backwardness or dread, which may prevent their first approaches, and may give the female sex a repugnance to all expressions, and postures, and liberties, that have an immediate relation to that enjoyment.</p>

For what means, wou'd he say, of persuading mankind, that the transgressions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other kind of injustice, when 'tis evident they are more excusable, upon account of the greatness of the temptation?

		<p class="block_6 en">But speculative reasonings, which cost so much pains to philosophers, are often form'd by the world naturally, and without reflection: As difficulties, which seem insurmountable in theory, are easily got over in practice. Those, who have an interest in the fidelity of women, naturally disapprove of their infidelity, and all the approaches to it. Those, who have no interest, are carried along with the stream. Education takes possession of the ductile minds of the fair sex in their infancy. And when a general rule of this kind is once establish'd, men are apt to extend it beyond those principles, from which it first arose. Thus bachelors, however debauch'd, cannot chuse but be shock'd with any instance of lewdness or impudence in women. And tho' all these maxims have a plain reference to generation, yet women past child-bearing have no more privilege in this respect, than those who are in the flower of their youth and beauty. Men have undoubtedly an implicit notion, that all those ideas of modesty and decency have a regard to generation; since they impose not the same laws, with the same force, on the male sex, where that reason takes not place. The exception is there obvious and extensive, and founded on a remarkable difference, which produces a clear separation and disjunction of ideas. But as the case is not the same with regard to the different ages of women, for this reason, tho' men know, that these notions are founded on the public interest, yet the general rule carries us beyond the original principle, and makes us extend the notions of modesty over the whole sex, from their earliest infancy to their extremest old-age and infirmity.</p>

'Tis contrary to the interest of civil society, that men shou'd have an entire liberty of indulging their appetites in venereal enjoyment: But as this interest is weaker than in the case of the female sex, the moral obligation, arising from it, must be proportionably weaker.

		<p class="block_6 en">Our sense of beauty depends very much on this principle; and where any object has a tendency to produce pleasure in its possessor, it is always regarded as beautiful; as every object, that has a tendency to produce pain, is disagreeable and deform'd. Thus the convenience of a house, the fertility of a field, the strength of a horse, the capacity, security, and swift-sailing of a vessel, form the principal beauty of these several objects. Here the object, which is denominated beautiful, pleases only by its tendency to produce a certain effect. That effect is the pleasure or advantage of some other person. Now the pleasure of a stranger, for whom we have no friendship, pleases us only by sympathy. To this principle, therefore, is owing the beauty, which we find in every thing that is useful. How considerable a part this is of beauty will easily appear upon reflection. Wherever an object has a tendency to produce pleasure in the possessor, or in other words, is the proper cause of pleasure, it is sure to please the spectator, by a delicate sympathy with the possessor. Most of the works of art are esteem'd beautiful, in proportion to their fitness for the use of man, and even many of the productions of nature derive their beauty from that source. Handsome and beautiful, on most occasions, is not an absolute but a relative quality, and pleases us by nothing but its tendency to produce an end that is agreeable<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-217" id="calibre_link-252" title="78">78</a></sup>.</p>

And since there is a very strong sentiment of morals, which in all nations, and all ages, has attended them, we must allow, that the reflecting on the tendency of characters and mental qualities, is sufficient to give us the sentiments of approbation and blame. Now as the means to an end can only be agreeable, where the end is agreeable; and as the good of society, where our own interest is not concern'd, or that of our friends, pleases only by sympathy: It follows, that sympathy is the source of the esteem, which we pay to all the artificial virtues.</p>

From thence we may presume, that it also gives rise to many of the other virtues; and that qualities acquire our approbation, because of their tendency to the good of mankind. This presumption must become a certainty, when we find that most of those qualities, which we <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> approve of, have actually that tendency, and render a man a proper member of society: While the qualities, which we <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> disapprove of, have a contrary tendency, and render any intercourse with the person dangerous or disagreeable. For having found, that such tendencies have force enough to produce the strongest sentiment of morals, we can never reasonably, in these cases, look for any other cause of approbation or blame; it being an inviolable maxim in philosophy, that where any particular cause is sufficient for an effect, we ought to rest satisfied with it, and ought not to multiply causes without necessity. We have happily attain'd experiments in the artificial virtues, where the tendency of qualities to the good of society, is the sole cause of our approbation, without any suspicion of the concurrence of another principle. From thence we learn the force of that principle. And where that principle may take place, and the quality approv'd of is really beneficial to society, a true philosopher will never require any other principle to account for the strongest approbation and esteem.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">That many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good of society, no one can doubt of. Meekness, beneficence, charity, generosity, clemency, moderation, equity, bear the greatest figure among the moral qualities, and are commonly denominated the <i class="calibre10">social</i> virtues, to mark their tendency to the good of society. This goes so far, that some philosophers have represented all moral distinctions as the effect of artifice and education, when skilful politicians endeavour'd to retrain the turbulent passions of men, and make them operate to the public good, by the notions of honour and shame. This system, however, is not consistent with experience. For, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, there are other virtues and vices beside those which have this tendency to the public advantage and loss. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, had not men a natural sentiment of approbation and blame, it cou'd never be excited by politicians; nor wou'd the words <i class="calibre10">laudable</i> and <i class="calibre10">praise-worthy, blameable</i> and <i class="calibre10">odious</i>, be any more intelligible, than if they were a language perfectly unknown to us, as we have already observ'd. But tho' this system be erroneous, it may teach us, that moral distinctions arise, in a great measure, from the tendency of qualities and characters to the interests of society, and that 'tis our concern for that interest, which makes us approve or disapprove of them. Now we have no such extensive concern for society but from sympathy; and consequently 'tis that principle, which takes us so far out of ourselves, as to give us the same pleasure or uneasiness in the characters of others, as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or loss.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The only difference betwixt the natural virtues and justice lies in this, that the good, which results from the former, arises from every single act, and is the object of some natural passion: Whereas a single act of justice, consider'd in itself, may often be contrary to the public good; and 'tis only the concurrence of mankind, in a general scheme or system of action, which is advantageous. When I relieve persons in distress, my natural humanity is my motive; and so far as my succour extends, so far have I promoted the happiness of my fellow-creatures. But if we examine all the questions, that come before any tribunal of justice, we shall find, that, considering each case apart, it wou'd as often be an instance of humanity to decide contrary to the laws of justice as conformable to them. Judges take from a poor man to give to a rich; they bestow on the dissolute the labour of the industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means of harming both themselves and others. The whole scheme, however, of law and justice is advantageous to the society; and 'twas with a view to this advantage, that men, by their voluntary conventions, establish'd it. After it is once establish'd by these conventions, it is <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> attended with a strong sentiment of morals; which can proceed from nothing but our sympathy with the interests of society. We need no other explication of that esteem, which attends such of the natural virtues, as have a tendency to the public good.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I must farther add, that there are several circumstances, which render this hypothesis much more probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. 'Tis certain, that the imagination is more affected by what is particular, than by what is general; and that the sentiments are always mov'd with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loose and undetermin'd: Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to society, but the whole scheme or system: And it may not, perhaps, be any individual person, for whom we are concern'd, who receives benefit from justice, but the whole society alike. On the contrary, every particular act of generosity, or relief of the industrious and indigent, is beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular person, who is not undeserving of it. 'Tis more natural, therefore, to think, that the tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our sentiments, and command our approbation, than those of the former; and therefore, since we find, that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies, we may ascribe, with better reason, the same cause to the approbation of the latter. In any number of similar effects, if a cause can be discover'd for one, we ought to extend that cause to all the other effects. which can be accounted for by it: But much more, if these other effects be attended with peculiar circumstances, which facilitate the operation of that cause.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Before I proceed farther, I must observe two remarkable circumstances in this affair, which may seem objections to the present system. The first may be thus explain'd. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind, we are pleas'd with it, and approve of it; because it presents the lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is itself a kind of pleasure. But as this sympathy is very variable, it may be thought, that our sentiments of morals must admit of all the same variations. We sympathize more with persons contiguous to us, than with persons remote from us: With our acquaintance, than with strangers: With our countrymen, than with foreigners. But notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy, we give the same approbation to the same moral qualities in <i class="calibre10">China</i> as in <i class="calibre10">England</i>. They appear equally virtuous, and recommend themselves equally to the esteem of a judicious spectator. The sympathy varies without a variation in our esteem. Our esteem, therefore, proceeds not from sympathy.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To this I answer: The approbation of moral qualities most certainly is not deriv'd from reason, or any comparison of ideas; but proceeds entirely from a moral taste, and from certain sentiments of pleasure or disgust, which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters. Now 'tis evident, that those sentiments, whence-ever they are deriv'd, must vary according to the distance or contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from the virtues of a person, who liv'd in <i class="calibre10">Greece</i> two thousand years ago, that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance. Yet I do not say, that I esteem the one more than the other: And therefore, if the variation of the sentiment, without a variation of the esteem, be an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as against that of sympathy. But to consider the matter a-right, it has no force at all; and 'tis the easiest matter in the world to account for it. Our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in continual fluctuation; and a man, that lies at a distance from us, may, in a little time, become a familiar acquaintance. Besides, every particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others; and 'tis impossible we cou'd ever converse together on any reasonable terms, were each of us to consider characters and persons, only as they appear from his peculiar point of view. In order, therefore, to prevent those continual <i class="calibre10">contradictions</i>, and arrive at a more <i class="calibre10">stable</i> judgment of things, we fix on some <i class="calibre10">steady</i> and <i class="calibre10">general</i> points of view; and always, in our thoughts, place ourselves in them, whatever may be our present situation. In like manner, external beauty is determin'd merely by pleasure; and 'tis evident, a beautiful countenance cannot give so much pleasure, when seen at the distance of twenty paces, as when it is brought nearer us. We say not, however, that it appears to us less beautiful: Because we know what effect it will have in such a position, and by that reflection we correct its momentary appearance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, all sentiments of blame or praise are variable, according to our situation of nearness or remoteness, with regard to the person blam'd or prais'd, and according to the present disposition of our mind. But these variations we regard not in our general decisions, but still apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike, in the same manner, as if we remain'd in one point of view. Experience soon teaches us this method of correcting our sentiments, or at least, of correcting our language, where the sentiments are more stubborn and inalterable. Our servant, if diligent and faithful, may excite stronger sentiments of love and kindness than <i class="calibre10">Marcus Brutus</i>, as represented in history; but we say not upon that account, that the former character is more laudable than the latter. We know, that were we to approach equally near to that renown'd patriot, he wou'd command a much higher degree of affection and admiration. Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses; and indeed 'twere impossible we cou'd ever make use of language, or communicate our sentiments to one another, did we not correct the momentary appearances of things, and overlook our present situation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis therefore from the influence of characters and qualities, upon those who have an intercourse with any person, that we blame or praise him. We consider not whether the persons, affected by the qualities, be our acquaintance or strangers, countrymen or foreigners. Nay, we over-look our own interest in those general judgments; and blame not a man for opposing us in any of our pretensions, when his own interest is particularly concern'd. We make allowance for a certain degree of selfishness in men; because we know it to be inseparable from human nature, and inherent in our frame and constitution. By this reflection we correct those sentiments of blame, which so naturally arise upon any opposition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But however the general principle of our blame or praise may be corrected by those other principles, 'tis certain, they are not altogether efficacious, nor do our passions often correspond entirely to the present theory. 'Tis seldom men heartily love what lies at a distance from them, and what no way redounds to their particular benefit; as 'tis no less rare to meet with persons, who can pardon another any opposition he makes to their interest, however justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality. Here we are contented with saying, that reason requires such an impartial conduct, but that 'tis seldom we can bring ourselves to it, and that our passions do not readily follow the determination of our judgment. This language will be easily understood, if we consider what we formerly said concerning that reason, which is able to oppose our passion; and which we have found to be nothing but a general calm determination of the passions, founded on some distant view or reflection. When we form our judgments of persons, merely from the tendency of their characters to our own benefit, or to that of our friends, we find so many contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation, and such an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation, that we seek some other standard of merit and demerit, which may not admit of so great variation. Being thus loosen'd from our first station, we cannot afterwards fix ourselves so commodiously by any means as by a sympathy with those, who have any commerce with the person we consider. This is far from being as lively as when our own interest is concern'd, or that of our particular friends; nor has it such an influence on our love and hatred: But being equally conformable to our calm and general principles, 'tis said to have an equal authority over our reason, and to command our judgment and opinion. We blame equally a bad action, which we read of in history, with one perform'd in our neighbourhood t'other day: The meaning of which is, that we know from reflection, that the former action wou'd excite as strong sentiments of disapprobation as the latter, were it plac'd in the same position.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I now proceed to the <i class="calibre10">second</i> remarkable circumstance, which I propos'd to take notice of. Where a person is possess'd of a character, that in its natural tendency is beneficial to society, we esteem him virtuous, and are delighted with the view of his character, even tho' particular accidents prevent its operation, and incapacitate him from being serviceable to his friends and country. Virtue in rags is still virtue; and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or desart, where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lost to all the world. Now this may be esteem'd an objection to the present system. Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind; and if sympathy were the source of our esteem for virtue, that sentiment of approbation cou'd only take place, where the virtue actually attain'd its end, and was beneficial to mankind. Where it fails of its end, 'tis only an imperfect means; and therefore can never acquire any merit from that end. The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on such means alone as are compleat, and actually produce the end.</p>

'Tis sufficient if every thing be compleat in the object itself. A house, that is contriv'd with great judgment for all the commodities of life, pleases us upon that account; tho' perhaps we are sensible, that no-one will ever dwell in it. A fertile soil, and a happy climate, delight us by a reflection on the happiness which they wou'd afford the inhabitants, tho' at present the country be desart and uninhabited. A man, whose limbs and shape promise strength and activity, is esteem'd handsome, tho' condemn'd to perpetual imprisonment. The imagination has a set of passions belonging to it, upon which our sentiments of beauty much depend. These passions are mov'd by degrees of liveliness and strength, which are inferior to <i class="calibre10">belief</i> and independent of the real existence of their objects. Where a character is, in every respect, fitted to be beneficial to society, the imagination passes easily from the cause to the effect, without considering that there are still some circumstances wanting to render the cause a compleat one. <i class="calibre10">General rules</i> create a species of probability, which sometimes influences the judgment, and always the imagination.</p>

We know, that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent disposition entirely impotent; and therefore we separate, as much as possible, the fortune from the disposition. The case is the same, as when we correct the different sentiments of virtue, which proceed from its different distances from ourselves. The passions do not always follow our corrections; but these corrections serve sufficiently to regulate our abstract notions, and are alone regarded, when we pronounce in general concerning the degrees of vice and virtue.</p>

My sympathy with another may give me the sentiment of pain and disapprobation, when any object is presented, that has a tendency to give him uneasiness; tho' I may not be willing to sacrifice any thing of my own interest, or cross any of my passions, for his satisfaction. A house may displease me by being ill-contriv'd for the convenience of the owner; and yet I may refuse to give a shilling towards the rebuilding of it. Sentiments must touch the heart, to make them controul our passions: But they need not extend beyond the imagination, to make them influence our taste. When a building seems clumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and disagreeable; tho' we be fully assur'd of the solidity of the workmanship. 'Tis a kind of fear, which causes this sentiment of disapprobation; but the passion is not the same with that which we feel, when oblig'd to stand under a wall, that we really think tottering and insecure.

Were nothing esteem'd virtue but what were beneficial to society, I am persuaded, that the foregoing explication of the moral sense ought still to be receiv'd, and that upon sufficient evidence: But this evidence must grow upon us, when we find other kinds of virtue, which will not admit of any explication except from that hypothesis. Here is a man, who is not remarkably defective in his social qualities; but what principally recommends him is his dexterity in business, by which he has extricated himself from the greatest difficulties, and conducted the most delicate affairs with a singular address and prudence. I find an esteem for him immediately to arise in me: His company is a satisfaction to me; and before I have any farther acquaintance with him, I wou'd rather do him a service than another, whose character is in every other respect equal, but is deficient in that particular. In this case, the qualities that please me are all consider'd as useful to the person, and as having a tendency to promote his interest and satisfaction. They are only regarded as means to an end, and please me in proportion to their fitness for that end. The end, therefore, must be agreeable to me. But what makes the end agreeable? The person is a stranger: I am no way interested in him, nor lie under any obligation to him: His happiness concerns not me, farther than the happiness of every human, and indeed of every sensible creature: That is, it affects me only by sympathy. From that principle, whenever I discover his happiness and good, whether in its causes or effects, I enter so deeply into it, that it gives me a sensible emotion.

Nor is this observable only with regard to characters and manners, but may be remark'd even in the most minute circumstances. A violent cough in another gives us uneasiness; tho' in itself it does not in the least affect us. A man will be mortified, if you tell him he has a stinking breath; tho' 'tis evidently no annoyance to himself. Our fancy easily changes its situation; and either surveying ourselves as we appear to others, or considering others as they feel themselves, we enter, by that means, into sentiments, which no way belong to us, and in which nothing but sympathy is able to interest us.

There are, however, instances, in cases of less moment, wherein this immediate taste or sentiment produces our approbation. Wit, and a certain easy and disengag'd behaviour, are qualities <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to others, and command their love and esteem. Some of these qualities produce satisfaction in others by particular <i class="calibre10">original</i> principles of human nature, which cannot be accounted for: Others may be resolv'd into principles, which are more general.

This pleasure and this pain may arise from four different sources. For we reap a pleasure from the view of a character, which is naturally fitted to be useful to others, or to the person himself, or which is agreeable to others, or to the person himself. One may, perhaps, be surpriz'd, that amidst all these interests and pleasures, we shou'd forget our own, which touch us so nearly on every other occasion. But we shall easily satisfy ourselves on this head, when we consider, that every particular person's pleasure and interest being different, 'tis impossible men cou'd ever agree in their sentiments and judgments, unless they chose some common point of view, from which they might survey their object, and which might cause it to appear the same to all of them. Now, in judging of characters, the only interest or pleasure, which appears the same to every spectator, is that of the person himself, whose character is examin'd; or that of persons, who have a connexion with him. And tho' such interests and pleasures touch us more faintly than our own, yet being more constant and universal, they counter-ballance the latter even in practice, and are alone admitted in speculation as the standard of virtue and morality. They alone produce that particular feeling or sentiment, on which moral distinctions depend.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may now be proper to illustrate this general system of morals, by applying it to particular instances of virtue and vice, and shewing how their merit or demerit arises from the four sources here explain'd. We shall begin with examining the passions of <i class="calibre10">pride</i> and <i class="calibre10">humility</i>, and shall consider the vice or virtue that lies in their excesses or just proportion. An excessive pride or over-weaning conceit of ourselves is always esteem'd vicious, and is universally hated; as modesty, or a just sense of our weakness, is esteem'd virtuous, and procures the good-will of every-one. Of the four sources of moral distinctions, this is to be ascrib'd to the <i class="calibre10">third</i>; viz. the immediate agreeableness and disagreeableness of a quality to others, without any reflections on the tendency of that quality.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to prove this, we must have recourse to two principles, which are very conspicuous in human nature. The <i class="calibre10">first</i> of these is the <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>, and communication of sentiments and passions above-mention'd. So close and intimate is the correspondence of human souls, that no sooner any person approaches me, than he diffuses on me all his opinions, and draws along my judgment in a greater or lesser degree. And tho', on many occasions, my sympathy with him goes not so far as entirely to change my sentiments, and way of thinking; yet it seldom is so weak as not to disturb the easy course of my thought, and give an authority to that opinion, which is recommended to me by his assent and approbation. Nor is it any way material upon what subject he and I employ our thoughts. Whether we judge of an indifferent person, or of my own character, my sympathy gives equal force to his decision: And even his sentiments of his own merit make me consider him in the same light, in which he regards himself.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This principle of sympathy is of so powerful and insinuating a nature, that it enters into most of our sentiments and passions, and often takes place under the appearance of its contrary. For 'tis remarkable, that when a person opposes me in any thing, which I am strongly bent upon, and rouzes up my passion by contradiction, I have always a degree of sympathy with him, nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin. We may here observe an evident conflict or encounter of opposite principles and passions. On the one side there is that passion or sentiment, which is natural to me; and 'tis observable, that the stronger this passion is, the greater is the commotion. There must also be some passion or sentiment on the other side; and this passion can proceed from nothing but sympathy. The sentiments of others can never affect us, but by becoming, in some measure, our own; in which case they operate upon us, by opposing and encreasing our passions, in the very same manner, as if they had been originally deriv'd from our own temper and disposition. While they remain conceal'd in the minds of others, they can never have any influence upon us: And even when they are known, if they went no farther than the imagination, or conception; that faculty is so accustom'd to objects of every different kind, that a mere idea, tho' contrary to our sentiments and inclinations, wou'd never alone be able to affect us.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">second</i> principle I shall take notice of is that of <i class="calibre10">comparison</i>, or the variation of our judgments concerning objects, according to the proportion they bear to those with which we compare them. We judge more of objects by comparison, than by their intrinsic worth and value; and regard every thing as mean, when set in opposition to what is superior of the same kind. But no comparison is more obvious than that with ourselves; and hence it is that on all occasions it takes place, and mixes with most of our passions. This kind of comparison is directly contrary to sympathy in its operation, as we have observ'd in treating of <i class="calibre10">compassion</i> and <i class="calibre10">malice</i>. <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-284" id="calibre_link-313" title="79">79</a></sup><i class="calibre10">In all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure; and therefore produces pain, when compar'd with our own. His pain consider'd in itself, is painful; but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.</i></p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since then those principles of sympathy, and a comparison with ourselves, are directly contrary, it may be worth while to consider, what general rules can be form'd, beside the particular temper of the person, for the prevalence of the one or the other. Suppose I am now in safety at land, and wou'd willingly reap some pleasure from this consideration: I must think on the miserable condition of those who are at sea in a storm, and must endeavour to render this idea as strong and lively as possible, in order to make me more sensible of my own happiness. But whatever pains I may take, the comparison will never have an equal efficacy, as if I were really on<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-285" id="calibre_link-370" title="80">80</a></sup> the shore, and saw a ship at a distance, tost by a tempest, and in danger every moment of perishing on a rock or sand-bank. But suppose this idea to become still more lively. Suppose the ship to be driven so near me, that I can perceive distinctly the horror, painted on the countenance of the seamen and passengers, hear their lamentable cries, see the dearest friends give their last adieu, or embrace with a resolution to perish in each others arms: No man has so savage a heart as to reap any pleasure from such a spectacle, or withstand the motions of the tenderest compassion and sympathy. 'Tis evident, therefore, there is a medium in this case; and that if the idea be too feint, it has no influence by comparison; and on the other hand, if it be too strong, it operates on us entirely by sympathy, which is the contrary to comparison. Sympathy being the conversion of an idea into an impression, demands a greater force and vivacity in the idea than is requisite to comparison.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">All this is easily applied to the present subject. We sink very much in our own eyes, when in the presence of a great man, or one of a superior genius; and this humility makes a considerable ingredient in that <i class="calibre10">respect</i>, which we pay our superiors, according to our <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-286" id="calibre_link-434" title="81">81</a></sup>foregoing reasonings on that passion. Sometimes even envy and hatred arise from the comparison; but in the greatest part of men, it rests at respect and esteem. As sympathy has such a powerful influence on the human mind, it causes pride to have, in some measure, the same effect as merit; and by making us enter into those elevated sentiments, which the proud man entertains of himself, presents that comparison, which is so mortifying and disagreeable. Our judgment does not entirely accompany him in the flattering conceit, in which he pleases himself; but still is so shaken as to receive the idea it presents, and to give it an influence above the loose conceptions of the imagination. A man, who, in an idle humour, wou'd form a notion of a person of a merit very much superior to his own, wou'd not be mortified by that fiction: But when a man, whom we are really persuaded to be of inferior merit, is presented to us; if we observe in him any extraordinary degree of pride and self-conceit; the firm persuasion he has of his own merit, takes hold of the imagination, and diminishes us in our own eyes, in the same manner, as if he were really possess'd of all the good qualities which he so liberally attributes to himself. Our idea is here precisely in that medium, which is requisite to make it operate on us by comparison. Were it accompanied with belief, and did the person appear to have the same merit, which he assumes to himself, it wou'd have a contrary effect, and wou'd operate on us by sympathy. The influence of that principle wou'd then be superior to that of comparison, contrary to what happens where the person's merit seems below his pretensions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The necessary consequence of these principles is, that pride, or an over-weaning conceit of ourselves, must be vicious; since it causes uneasiness in all men, and presents them every moment with a disagreeable comparison. 'Tis a trite observation in philosophy, and even in common life and conversation, that 'tis our own pride, which makes us so much displeas'd with the pride of other people; and that vanity becomes insupportable to us merely because we are vain. The gay naturally associate themselves with the gay, and the amorous with the amorous: But the proud never can endure the proud, and rather seek the company of those who are of an opposite disposition. As we are, all of us, proud in some degree, pride is universally blam'd and condemn'd by all mankind; as having a natural tendency to cause uneasiness in others by means of comparison. And this effect must follow the more naturally, that those, who have an ill-grounded conceit of themselves, are for ever making those comparisons, nor have they any other method of supporting their vanity. A man of sense and merit is pleas'd with himself, independent of all foreign considerations: But a fool must always find some person, that is more foolish, in order to keep himself in good humour with his own parts and understanding.</p>

The utility and advantage of any quality to ourselves is a source of virtue, as well as its agreeableness to others; and 'tis certain, that nothing is more useful to us in the conduct of life, than a due degree of pride, which makes us sensible of our own merit, and gives us a confidence and assurance in all our projects and enterprizes. Whatever capacity any one may be endow'd with, 'tis entirely useless to him, if he be not acquainted with it, and form not designs suitable to it. 'Tis requisite on all occasions to know our own force; and were it allowable to err on either side, 'twou'd be more advantageous to overrate our merit, than to form ideas of it, below its just standard. Fortune commonly favours the bold and enterprizing; and nothing inspires us with more boldness than a good opinion of ourselves.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus self-satisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable, but requisite in a character. 'Tis, however, certain, that good-breeding and decency require that we shou'd avoid all signs and expressions, which tend directly to show that passion. We have, all of us, a wonderful partiality for ourselves, and were we always to give vent to our sentiments in this particular, we shou'd mutually cause the greatest indignation in each other, not only by the immediate presence of so disagreeable a subject of comparison, but also by the contrariety of our judgments. In like manner, therefore, as we establish the <i class="calibre10">law of nature</i>, in order to secure property in society, and prevent the opposition of self-interest; we establish the <i class="calibre10">rules of good-breeding</i>, in order to prevent the opposition of men's pride, and render conversation agreeable and inoffensive. Nothing is more disagreeable than a man's over-weaning conceit of himself: Every one almost has a strong propensity to this vice: No one can well distinguish <i class="calibre10">in himself</i> betwixt the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his esteem of his own merit is well-founded: For these reasons, all direct expressions of this passion are condemn'd; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of sense and merit. They are not allow'd to do themselves justice openly, in words, no more than other people; and even if they show a reserve and secret doubt in doing themselves justice in their own thoughts, they will be more applauded. That impertinent, and almost universal propensity of men, to over-value themselves, has given us such a <i class="calibre10">prejudice</i> against self-applause, that we are apt to condemn it, by general rule, wherever we meet with it; and 'tis with some difficulty we give a privilege to men of sense, even in their most secret thoughts. At least, it must be own'd, that some disguise in this particular is absolutely requisite; and that if we harbour pride in our breasts, we must carry a fair outside. and have the appearance of modesty and mutual deference in all our conduct and behaviour. We must, on every occasion, be ready to prefer others to ourselves; to treat them with a kind of deference, even tho' they be our equals; to seem always the lowest and least in the company, where we are not very much distinguish'd above them: And if we observe these rules in our conduct, men will have more indulgence for our secret sentiments, when we discover them in an oblique manner.</p>

On the contrary, we may observe, that a genuine and hearty pride, or self-esteem, if well conceal'd and well founded, is essential to the character of a man of honour, and that there is no quality of the mind, which is more indispensably requisite to procure the esteem and approbation of mankind. There are certain deferences and mutual submissions, which custom requires of the different ranks of men towards each other; and whoever exceeds in this particular, if thro' interest, is accus'd of meanness; if thro' ignorance, of simplicity. 'Tis necessary, therefore, to know our rank and station in the world, whether it be fix'd by our birth, fortune, employments, talents or reputation. 'Tis necessary to feel the sentiment and passion of pride in conformity to it, and to regulate our actions accordingly. And shou'd it be said, that prudence may suffice to regulate our actions in this particular, without any real pride, I wou'd observe, that here the object of prudence is to conform our actions to the general usage and custom; and that 'tis impossible those tacit airs of superiority shou'd ever have been establish'd and authoriz'd by custom, unless men were generally proud, and unless that passion were generally approv'd, when well-grounded.</p>

Courage, intrepidity, ambition, love of glory, magnanimity, and all the other shining virtues of that kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and derive a great part of their merit from that origin. Accordingly we find, that many religious declaimers decry those virtues as purely pagan and natural, and represent to us the excellency of the <i class="calibre10">Christian</i> religion, which places humility in the rank of virtues, and corrects the judgment of the world, and even of philosophers, who so generally admire all the efforts of pride and ambition. Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly understood, I shall not pretend to determine. I am content with the concession, that the world naturally esteems a well-regulated pride, which secretly animates our conduct, without breaking out into such indecent expressions of vanity, as may offend the vanity of others.</p>

When it goes beyond its just bounds, it loses the first advantage, and even becomes prejudicial; which is the reason why we condemn an extravagant pride and ambition, however regulated by the decorums of good-breeding and politeness. But as such a passion is still agreeable, and conveys an elevated and sublime sensation to the person, who is actuated by it, the sympathy with that satisfaction diminishes considerably the blame, which naturally attends its dangerous influence on his conduct and behaviour. Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes, in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he wou'd never have been acquainted.</p>

As long as these are present to us, we are more inclin'd to hate than admire the ambition of heroes. But when we fix our view on the person himself, who is the author of all this mischief, there is something so dazling in his character, the mere contemplation of it so elevates the mind, that we cannot refuse it our admiration.

Now as an insolence of this kind is blam'd even in a person who has always been civil to ourselves in particular; nay, in one, whose name is only known to us in history; it follows, that our disapprobation proceeds from a sympathy with others, and from the reflection, that such a character is highly displeasing and odious to every one, who converses or has any intercourse with the person possest of it.

When the natural tendency of his passions leads him to be serviceable and useful within his sphere, we approve of his character. and love his person, by a sympathy with the sentiments of those, who have a more particular connexion with him. We are quickly oblig'd to forget our own interest in our judgments of this kind, by reason of the perpetual contradictions, we meet with in society and conversation, from persons that are not plac'd in the same situation, and have not the same interest with ourselves. The only point of view, in which our sentiments concur with them of others, is, when we consider the tendency of any passion to the advantage or harm of those, who have any immediate connexion or intercourse with the person possess'd of it. And tho' this advantage or harm be often very remote from ourselves, yet sometimes 'tis very near us, and interests us strongly by sympathy. This concern we readily extend to other cases, that are resembling; and when these are very remote, our sympathy is proportionably weaker, and our praise or blame fainter and more doubtful. The case is here the same as in our judgments concerning external bodies. All objects seem to diminish by their distance: But tho' the appearance of objects to our senses be the original standard, by which we judge of them, yet we do not say, that they actually diminish by the distance; but correcting the appearance by reflection, arrive at a more constant and establish'd judgment concerning them. In like manner, tho' sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves, and a sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter than that with persons near and contiguous; yet we neglect all these differences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of men. Besides, that we ourselves often change our situation in this particular, we every day meet with persons, who are in a different situation from ourselves, and who cou'd never converse with us on any reasonable terms, were we to remain constantly in that situation and point of view, which is peculiar to us. The intercourse of sentiments, therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general inalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of characters and manners. And tho' the <i class="calibre10">heart</i> does not always take part with those general notions, or regulate its love and hatred by them, yet are they sufficient for discourse, and serve all our purposes in company, in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.</p>

A propensity to the tender passions makes a man agreeable and useful in all the parts of life; and gives a just direction to all his other qualities, which otherwise may become prejudicial to society. Courage and ambition, when not regulated by benevolence, are it only to make a tyrant and public robber. 'Tis the same case with judgment and capacity, and all the qualities of that kind.

'Tis certain we are infinitely touch'd with a tender sentiment, as well as with a great one. The tears naturally start in our eyes at the conception of it; nor can we forbear giving a loose to the same tenderness towards the person who exerts it. All this seems to me a proof, that our approbation has, in those cases, an origin different from the prospect of utility and advantage, either to ourselves or others. To which we may add, that men naturally, without reflection, approve of that character, which is most like their own. The man of a mild disposition and tender affections, in forming a notion of the most perfect virtue, mixes in it more of benevolence and humanity, than the man of courage and enterprize, who naturally looks upon a certain elevation of mind as the most accomplish'd character. This must evidently proceed from an <i class="calibre10">immediate</i> sympathy. which men have with characters similar to their own.

Such delicacies have little influence on society; because they make us regard the greatest trifles: But they are the more engaging, the more minute the concern is, and are a proof of the highest merit in any one, who is capable of them. The passions are so contagious, that they pass with the greatest facility from one person to another, and produce correspondent movements in all human breasts. Where friendship appears in very signal instances, my heart catches the same passion, and is warm'd by those warm sentiments, that display themselves before me. Such agreeable movements must give me an affection to every one that excites them. This is the case with every thing that is agreeable in any person. The transition from pleasure to love is easy: But the transition must here be still more easy; since the agreeable sentiment, which is excited by sympathy, is love itself; and there is nothing requir'd but to change the object.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">No distinction is more usual in all systems of ethics, than that betwixt <i class="calibre10">natural abilities</i> and <i class="calibre10">moral virtues</i>; where the former are plac'd on the same footing with bodily endowments, and are suppos'd to have no merit or moral worth annex'd to them. Whoever considers the matter accurately, will find, that a dispute upon this head wou'd be merely a dispute of words, and that tho' these qualities are not altogether of the same kind, yet they agree in the most material circumstances. They are both of them equally mental qualities: And both of them equally produce pleasure; and have of course an equal tendency to procure the love and esteem of mankind. There are few, who are not as jealous of their character, with regard to sense and knowledge, as to honour and courage; and much more than with regard to temperance and sobriety. Men are even afraid of passing for good-natur'd; lest <i class="calibre10">that</i> shou'd be taken for want of understanding: And often boast of more debauches than they have been really engag'd in, to give themselves airs of fire and spirit. In short, the figure a man makes in the world, the reception he meets with in company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages depend almost as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Let a man have the best intentions in the world, and be the farthest from all injustice and violence, he will never be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at least, of parts and understanding. Since then natural abilities, tho', perhaps, inferior, yet are on the same footing, both as to their causes and effects, with those qualities which we call moral virtues, why shou'd we make any distinction betwixt them?</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Tho' we refuse to natural abilities the title of virtues, we must allow, that they procure the love and esteem of mankind; that they give a new lustre to the other virtues; and that a man possess'd of them is much more intitled to our good-will and services, than one entirely void of them. It may, indeed, be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those qualities produce, besides its being <i class="calibre10">inferior</i>, is also somewhat <i class="calibre10">different</i> from that, which attends the other virtues. But this, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason for excluding them from the catalogue of virtues. Each of the virtues, even benevolence, justice, gratitude, integrity, excites a different sentiment or feeling in the spectator. The characters of <i class="calibre10">Cæsar</i> and <i class="calibre10">Cato</i>, as drawn by <i class="calibre10">Sallust</i>, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest sense of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise from them. The one produces love; the other esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We cou'd wish to meet with the one character in a friend; the other character we wou'd be ambitious of in ourselves. In like manner, the approbation, which attends natural abilities, may be somewhat different to the feeling from that, which arise from the other virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And indeed we may observe, that the natural abilities, no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation. Good sense and genius beget esteem: Wit and humour excite love.<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-401" id="calibre_link-227" title="83">83</a></sup> </p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Those, who represent the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues as very material, may say, that the former are entirely involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no dependence on liberty and free-will. But to this I answer, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, that many of those qualities, which all moralists, especially the antients, comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and necessary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagination. Of this nature are constancy, fortitude, magnanimity; and, in short, all the qualities which form the <i class="calibre10">great</i> man. I might say the same, in some degree, of the others; it being almost impossible for the mind to change its character in any considerable article. or cure itself of a passionate or splenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater degree there is of these blame able qualities, the more vicious they become, and yet they are the less voluntary. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, I wou'd have any one give me a reason, why virtue and vice may not be involuntary, as well as beauty and deformity. These moral distinctions arise from the natural distinctions of pain and pleasure; and when we receive those feelings from the general consideration of any quality or character, we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will assert, that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who considers it, unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who possesses it. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, As to free-will, we have shewn that it has no place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It is not a just consequence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions are more voluntary than our judgments; but we have not more liberty in the one than in the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary be not sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues, yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible reason, why moralists have invented the latter. Men have observ'd, that tho' natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the same footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the former are almost invariable by any art or industry; while the latter, or at least, the actions, that proceed from them, may be chang'd by the motives of rewards and punishments, praise and blame. Hence legislators, and divines, and moralists, have principally applied themselves to the regulating these voluntary actions, and have endeavour'd to produce additional motives for being virtuous in that particular. They knew, that to punish a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and sagacious, wou'd have but little effect; tho' the same punishments and exhortations, with regard to justice and injustice, might have a considerable influence. But as men, in common life and conversation, do not carry those ends in view, but naturally praise or blame whatever pleases or displeases them, they do not seem much to regard this distinction, but consider prudence under the character of virtue as well as benevolence, and penetration as well as justice. Nay, we find, that all moralists, whose judgment is not perverted by a strict adherence to a system, enter into the same way of thinking; and that the antient moralists in particular made no scruple of placing prudence at the head of the cardinal virtues. There is a sentiment of esteem and approbation, which may be excited, in some degree, by any faculty of the mind, in its perfect state and condition; and to account for this sentiment is the business of <i class="calibre10">Philosophers</i>. It belongs to <i class="calibre10">Grammarians</i> to examine what qualities are entitled to the denomination of <i class="calibre10">virtue</i>; nor will they find, upon trial, that this is so easy a task, as at first sight they may be apt to imagine.</p>

The reason of the difference certainly must be, that the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or pain; and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in business and affairs. But the least variations in the judgment are sensibly felt in their consequences; while at the same time that faculty is never exerted in any eminent degree, without an extraordinary delight and satisfaction.

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been observ'd, in treating of the passions, that pride and humility, love and hatred, are excited by any advantage or disadvantages of the mind, body, or fortune; and that these advantages or disadvantages have that effect, by producing a separate impression of pain or pleasure. The pain or pleasure, which arises from the general survey or view of any action or quality of the mind, constitutes its vice or virtue, and gives rise to our approbation or blame, which is nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred. We have assign'd four different sources of this pain and pleasure; and in order to justify more fully that hypothesis, it may here be proper to observe, that the advantages or disadvantages of the <i class="calibre10">body</i> and of <i class="calibre10">fortune</i>, produce a pain or pleasure from the very same principles. The tendency of any object to be <i class="calibre10">useful</i> to the person possess'd of it, or to others; to convey <i class="calibre10">pleasure</i> to him or to others; all these circumstances convey an immediate pleasure to the person, who considers the object, and command his love and approbation.</p>

'Tis a general remark, that those we call good <i class="calibre10">women's men</i>, who have either signaliz'd themselves by their amorous exploits, or whose make of body promises any extraordinary vigour of that kind, are well received by the fair sex, and naturally engage the affections even of those, whose virtue prevents any design of ever giving employment to those talents. Here 'tis evident, that the ability of such a person to give enjoyment, is the real source of that love and esteem he meets with among the females; at the same time that the women, who love and esteem him, have no prospect of receiving that enjoyment themselves, and can only be affected by means of their sympathy with one, that has a commerce of love with' him.

		<p class="block_6 en">How far the advantages of <i class="calibre10">fortune</i> produce esteem and approbation from the same principles, we may satisfy ourselves by redacting on our precedent reasoning on that subject. We have observ'd, that our approbation of those, who are possess'd of the advantages of fortune, may be ascrib'd to three different causes. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, To that immediate pleasure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful cloaths, equipage, gardens, or houses, which he possesses. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, To the advantage, which we hope to reap from him by his generosity and liberality. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, To the pleasure and advantage, which he himself reaps from his possessions, and which produce an agreeable sympathy in us. Whether we ascribe our esteem of the rich and great to one or all of these causes, we may clearly see the traces of those principles, which give rise to the sense of vice and virtue. I believe most people, at first sight, will be inclin'd to ascribe our esteem of the rich to self-interest, and the prospect of advantage. But as 'tis certain, that our esteem or deference extends beyond any prospect of advantage to ourselves, 'tis evident, that that sentiment must proceed from a sympathy with those, who are dependent on the person we esteem and respect, and who have an immediate connexion with him. We consider him as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of his fellow-creatures, whose sentiments, with regard to him, we naturally embrace. And this consideration will serve to justify my hypothesis in preferring the <i class="calibre10">third</i> principle to the other two, and ascribing our esteem of the rich to a sympathy with the pleasure and advantage, which they themselves receive from their possessions. For as even the other two principles cannot operate to a due extent, or account for all the phænomena, without having recourse to a sympathy of one kind or other; 'tis much more natural to chuse that sympathy, which is immediate and direct, than that which is remote and indirect. To which we may add, that where the riches or power are very great, and render the person considerable and important in the world, the esteem attending them, may, in part, be ascrib'd to another source, distinct from these three, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> their interesting the mind by a prospect of the multitude, and importance of their consequences: Tho', in order to account for the operation of this principle, we must also have recourse to <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>; as we have observ' d in the preceding section.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be amiss, on this occasion, to remark the flexibility of our sentiments, and the several changes they so readily receive from the objects, with which they are conjoin'd. All the sentiments of approbation, which attend any particular species of objects, have a great resemblance to each other, tho' deriv'd from different sources; and, on the other hand, those sentiments, when directed to different objects, are different to the feeling, tho' deriv'd from the same source. Thus the beauty of all visible objects causes a pleasure pretty much the same, tho' it be sometimes deriv'd from the mere <i class="calibre10">species</i> and appearance of the objects; sometimes from sympathy, and an idea of their utility. In like manner, whenever we survey the actions and characters of men, without any particular interest in them, the pleasure, or pain, which arises from the survey (with some minute differences) is, in the main, of the same kind, tho' perhaps there be a great diversity in the causes, from which it is deriv'd. On the other hand, a convenient house, and a virtuous character, cause not the same feeling of approbation; even tho' the source of our approbation be the same, and flow from sympathy and an idea of their utility. There is something very inexplicable in this variation of our feelings; but 'tis what we have experience of with regard to all our passions and sentiments.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an accurate proof of this system of ethics. We are certain, that sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature. We are also certain, that it has a great influence on our sense of beauty, when we regard external objects, as well as when we judge of morals. We find that it has force sufficient to give us the strongest sentiments of approbation, when it operates alone, without the concurrence of any other principle; as in the cases of justice, allegiance, chastity, and good-manners. We may observe, that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most part, a tendency to the good of society, or to that of the person possess'd of them. If we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy is the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that no objection can be rais'd against this hypothesis in one case, which will not extend to all cases. justice is certainly approv'd of for no other reason, than because it has a tendency to the public good: And the public good is indifferent to us, except so far as sympathy interests us in it. We may presume the like with regard to all the other virtues, which have a like tendency to the public good. They must derive all their merit from our sympathy with those, who reap any advantage from them: As the virtues, which have a tendency to the good of the person possess'd of them, derive their merit from our sympathy with him.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Most people will readily allow, that the useful qualities of the mind are virtuous, because of their utility. This way of thinking is so natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple of admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy must necessarily be acknowledge'd. Virtue is consider'd as means to an end. Means to an end are only valued so far as the end is valued. But the happiness of strangers affects us by sympathy alone. To that principle, therefore, we are to ascribe the sentiment of approbation, which arises from the survey of all those virtues, 'that are useful to society, or to the person possess'd of them. These form the most considerable part of morality.</p>

All lovers of virtue (and such we all are in speculation, however we may degenerate in practice) must certainly be pleas'd to see moral distinctions deriv'd from so noble a source, which gives us a just notion both of the <i class="calibre10">generosity</i> and <i class="calibre10">capacity</i> of human nature. It requires but very little knowledge of human affairs to perceive, that a sense of morals is a principle inherent in the soul, and one of the most powerful that enters into the composition. But this sense must certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself; it approves of those principles, from whence it is deriv'd, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin. Those who resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind, may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority; but want the advantage, which those possess, who account for that sense by an extensive sympathy with mankind. According to their system, not only virtue must be approv'd of, but also the sense of virtue: And not only that sense, but also the principles, from whence it is deriv'd. So that nothing is presented on any side, but what is laudable and good.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This observation may be extended to justice, and the other virtues of that kind. Tho' justice be artificial, the sense of its morality is natural.

		<p class="block_6 en">Most of the inventions of men are subject to change. They depend upon humour and caprice. They have a vogue for a time, and then sink into oblivion. It may, perhaps, be apprehended, that if justice were allow'd to be a human invention, it must be plac'd on the same footing. But the cases are widely different. The interest, on which justice is founded, is the greatest imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It cannot possibly be serv'd by any other invention. It is obvious, and discovers itself on the very first formation of society. All these causes render the rules of justice stedfast and immutable; at least, as immutable as human nature. And if they were founded on original instincts, cou'd they have any greater stability?</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The same system may help us to form a just notion of the <i class="calibre10">happiness</i>, as well as of the <i class="calibre10">dignity</i> of virtue, and may interest every principle of our nature in the embracing and cherishing that noble quality. Who indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in his pursuits of knowledge and ability of every kind, when he considers, that besides the advantage, which immediately result from these acquisitions, they also give him a new lustre in the eyes of mankind, and are universally attended with esteem and approbation? And who can think any advantages of fortune a sufficient compensation for the least breach of the <i class="calibre10">social</i> virtues, when he considers, that not only his character with regard to others, but also his peace and inward satisfaction entirely depend upon his strict observance of them; and that a mind will never be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society? But I forbear insisting on this subject. Such reflections require a work a-part, very different from the genius of the present. The anatomist ought never to emulate the painter; nor in his accurate dissections and portraiture's of the smaller parts of the human body, pretend to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or expression. There is even something hideous, or at least minute in the views of things, which he presents; and 'tis necessary the objects shou'd be set more at a distance, and be more cover'd up from sight, to make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An anatomist, however, is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and 'tis even impracticable to excel in the latter art, without the assistance of the former. We must have an exact knowledge of the parts, their situation and connexion, before we can design with any elegance or correctness. And thus the most abstract speculations conceding human nature, however cold and unentertaining, become subservient to <i class="calibre10">practical morality</i>; and may render this latter science more correct in its precepts, and more persuasive in its exhortations.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">We can never be induced to believe any matter of fact, except where its cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of reality or existence, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar feeling or sentiment. That it is not a new idea, annexed to the simple conception, may be evinced from these two arguments. First, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects. It is impossible, therefore, that this idea of existence can be annexed to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief. Secondly, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and can separate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea, annexed to the conception, it would be in a man's power to believe what he pleased. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something, that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are convinced of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere reveries of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination, would be on an equal footing with the most established truths founded on history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment, to distinguish the one from the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception, the next question, that naturally occurs, is, what is the nature of this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind? This question is important. For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and moved by them. It acquiesces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they approach nearer to the impressions, which are immediately present to us; and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion, but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It is only annexed to it, after the same manner that will and desire are annexed to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this hypothesis. First, It is directly contrary to experience, and our immediate consciousness. All men have ever allowed reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our conclusions but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear at present a person's voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possessed of. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them. It is the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be disputed on any occasion, it is when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interposed object conceals the rest of his body. Here it is certain, the imagination spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be possessed of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is performed by the thought or imagination alone. The transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct impression, it must be allowed, that the mind has a firmer hold, or more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply suppositions without necessity?</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, We can explain the causes of the firm conception, but not those of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoined, or is associated with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Fourthly, The effects of belief, in influencing the passions and imagination, can all be explained from the firm conception; and there is no occasion to have recourse to any other principle. These arguments, with many others, enumerated in the foregoing volumes, sufficiently prove, that belief only modifies the idea or conception; and renders it different to the feeling, without producing any distinct impression. Thus upon a general view of the subject, there appear to be two questions of importance, which we may venture to recommend to the consideration of philosophers, Whether there be any thing to distinguish belief from the simple conception beside the feeling of sentiment? And, Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception, or a faster hold, that we take of the object?</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">If, upon impartial enquiry, the same conclusion, that I have formed, be assented to by philosophers, the next business is to examine the analogy, which there is betwixt belief, and other acts of the mind, and find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception: And this I do not esteem a difficult task. The transition from a present impression, always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented, the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something real and solid. It is felt, rather than conceived, and approaches the impression, from which it is derived, in its force and influence. This I have proved at large. I cannot add any new arguments.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, the following reasoning seems satisfactory. All ideas are borrowed from preceding perceptions. Our ideas of objects, therefore, are derived from that source. Consequently no proposition can be intelligible or consistent with regard to objects, which is not so with regard to perceptions. But it is intelligible and consistent to say, that objects exist distinct and independent, without any common simple substance or subject of inhesion. This proposition, therefore, can never be absurd with regard to perceptions.</p>

It is the composition of these, therefore, which forms the self. We can conceive a thinking being to have either many or few perceptions. Suppose the mind to be reduced even below the life of an oyster. Suppose it to have only one perception, as of thirst or hunger. Consider it in that situation. Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception? Have you any notion of self or substance? If not, the addition of other perceptions can never give you that notion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far I seem to be attended with sufficient evidence. But having thus loosened all our particular perceptions, when I proceed to explain the principle of connexion, which binds them together, and makes us attribute to them a real simplicity and identity; I am sensible, that my account is very defective, and that nothing but the seeming evidence of the precedent reasonings coued have induced me to receive it. If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding. We only feel a connexion or determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclined to think, that personal identity arises from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, when I come to explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness. I cannot discover any theory, which gives me satisfaction on this head.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In short there are two principles, which I cannot render consistent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz, that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple and individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them, there would be no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege of a sceptic, and confess, that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding. I pretend not, however, to pronounce it absolutely insuperable. Others, perhaps, or myself, upon more mature reflections, may discover some hypothesis, that will reconcile those contradictions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I shall also take this opportunity of confessing two other errors of less importance, which more mature reflection has discovered to me in my reasoning. The first may be found in Vol. I. page 106. where I say, that the distance betwixt two bodies is known, among other things, by the angles, which the rays of light flowing from the bodies make with each other. It is certain, that these angles are not known to the mind, and consequently can never discover the distance. The second error may be found in Vol. I. page 144 where I say, that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different degrees of force and vivacity. I believe there are other differences among ideas, which cannot properly be comprehended under these terms. Had I said, that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different feeling, I should have been nearer the truth.</p>

		<p class="block_12 en"> We may here take occasion to observe a very remarkable error, which being frequently inculcated in the schools, has become a kind of establish'd maxim, and is universally received by all logicians. This error consists in the vulgar division of the acts of the understanding, into <i class="calibre10">conception</i>, <i class="calibre10">judgment</i> and <i class="calibre10">reasoning</i>, and in the definitions we give of them. Conception is defin'd to be the simple survey of one or more ideas: Judgment to be the separating or uniting of different ideas: Reasoning to be the separating or uniting of different ideas by the interposition of others, which show the relation they bear to each other. But these distinctions and definitions are faulty in very considerable articles. For <i class="calibre10">first</i>, 'tis far from being true, that in every judgment, which we form, we unite two different ideas; since in that proposition, <i class="calibre10">God is</i>, or indeed any other, which regards existence, the idea of existence is no distinct idea, which we unite with that of the object, and which is capable of forming a compound idea by the union. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, As we can thus form a proposition, which contains only one idea, so we may exert our reason without employing more than two ideas, and without having recourse to a third to serve as a medium betwixt them. We infer a cause immediately from its effect; and this inference is not only a true species of reasoning, but the strongest of all others, and more convincing than when we interpose another idea to connect the two extremes. What we may in general affirm concerning these three acts of the understanding is, that taking them in a proper light, they all resolve themselves into the first, and are nothing but particular ways of conceiving our objects. Whether we consider a single object, or several; whether we dwell on these objects, or run from them to others; and in whatever form or order we survey them, the act of the mind exceeds not a simple conception; and the only remarkable difference, which occurs on this occasion, is, when we join belief to the conception, and are perswaded of the truth of what we conceive. This act of the mind has never yet been explain'd by any philosopher; and therefore I am at liberty to propose my hypothesis concerning it; which is, that 'tis only a strong and steady conception of any idea, and such as approaches in some measure to an immediate impression.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> In general we may observe, that as our assent to all probable reasonings on the vivacity of ideas, it resembles many of those whimsies and prejudices, which are rejected under the opprobrious character of being the offspring of the imagination. By this expression it appears that the word, imagination, is commonly us'd in two different senses; and tho' nothing be more contrary to true philosophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in the following reasonings I have often been oblig'd to fall into it. When I oppose the imagination to the memory, I mean the faculty, by which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppose it to reason, I mean the same faculty, excluding only our demonstrative and probable reasonings. When I oppose it to neither, 'tis indifferent whether it be taken the larger or more limited sense, or at least the context will sufficiently explain the meaning.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> This reasoning, it must be confest, is somewhat abstruse, and difficult to be comprehended; but it is remarkable, that this very difficulty may be converted into a proof of the reasoning. We may observe, that there are two relations, and both of them resemblances, which contribute to our mistaking the succession of our interrupted perceptions for an identical object. The first is, the resemblance of the perceptions: The second is the resemblance, which the act of the mind in surveying a succession of resembling objects bears to that in surveying an identical object. Now these resemblances we are apt to confound with each other; and 'tis natural we shou'd, according to this very reasoning. But let us keep them distinct, and we shall find no difficulty in conceiving the precedent argument.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this, if a late author [Wollaston], who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation, by contrary causes, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as alike uncertainty and variety of causes take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality, it shou'd follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou'd in every case be inseparable.<br class="calibre3"/>Add to this, that had I had used the precaution of shutting the windows, while I indulg'd myself in those liberties with my neighbour's wife, I should have been guilty of no immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly conceal'd, wou'd have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion. For the same reason, a thief, who steals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv'd, or if he be, 'tis impossible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from these circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very readily cause mistakes in others, and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person, while they address themselves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral?<br class="calibre3"/>Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who takes possession of <i class="calibre10">another'</i>s goods, and uses them as his own, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent morality?<br class="calibre3"/>A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it because 'tis his duty to be grateful? But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm'd? But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception?<br class="calibre3"/>But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as to account for the merit or tarpitude of any other action. I shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action, provided you can give me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning.<br class="calibre3"/>This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex'd to this species of truth or falshood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it? Or, who ever perform'd any, that he might give rise to true conclusions?</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> As a proof, how confus'd our way of thinking on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who assert, that morality is demonstrable. do not say, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can discover such an action, in such relations, to be virtuous, and such another vicious. It seems they thought it sufficient, if they cou'd bring the word, Relation, into the proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the whole complicated object, of action an situation, must form certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists. This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions are decisive, and must not be eluded.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves for the same phænomenon, to determine which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances. Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these rules are principally fix'd by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our ought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving it to the reader's choice, whether he will prefer those deliv'd from pubick utility, or those deriv'd from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the present possessor.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis a quality, which ((<i class="calibre10">a</i>) <i class="calibre10">Book</i> I. <i class="calibre10">Part</i> IV. <i class="calibre10">sect</i>. 5.) I have already observ'd in human nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin'd by causation, and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, 'twill easily be imagin'd, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, 'twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are <i class="calibre10">resembling</i> in <i class="calibre10">continuity</i> to each other, or at least in <i class="calibre10">correspondent</i> points of view; because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the known properties o human nature. When the mind is determin'd to join certain objects, but undetermin'd in its choice of the particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction, it wou'd require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural amnity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of <i class="calibre10">beauty</i>. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contribute to the formation of society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession. And as property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, 'tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur'd by the laws of society. 'tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, 'tis more so, to conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and public interest, we never shall find satisfaction; and if we look for it in the imagination, 'tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty, run so insensibly and gradually into each other, that 'tis impossible to give them any precise bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head must encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem'd possession in one case, which is not esteem'd such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness, wou`d look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within reach, has no reason to complain, ' another, more alert, passes him, and takes possession. What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms that ease a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other?<br class="calibre3"/>Here then it a pears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often, produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, <i class="calibre10">that even a whole continent belongs to the nation, which first discover'd it</i>. 'Tis however remarkable, that both in the cue of discovery and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation and intention of rendering himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great, but that it requires to be held by such an intention.<br class="calibre3"/>From all these circumstances, 'tis easy to see how perplex'd many qestions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision. If we prefer examples, which are real, to such as are feign'd, we may consider the following one, which is to be met with in almost every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature. Two <i class="calibre10">Grecian</i> colonies, leaving their native country, in search of new seats, were inform'd that a city near them was deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth ot' this report, they dispatch'd at once two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch'd his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc'd a dispute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part, I find the dispute impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy, which in this case is not possess'd of any precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give sentence. To make this evident, let us consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and not messengers or deputies, their actions wou'd not have been of any consequence; since in that ease their relation to the colonies wou'd have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin'd them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the piercing the gates wi a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation, in the other case, equally obvious. tho' not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> This source of property can never explain'd but from the imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix'd. We shall proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience.<br class="calibre3"/>It been observ'd above, that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such a union. From this propensity are deriv'd these laws of nature, <i class="calibre10">that upon the first formation of society, property always follows the present possession;</i> and afterwards, <i class="calibre10">that it arises from first or from long possession</i>. Now we may easily observe, that relation is not confin'd merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other object which is related to it, and so on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may weaken by each remove, 'tis not immediately destroy'd; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of <i class="calibre10">accession</i>, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess'd of, but also of such as are closely connected with them.<br class="calibre3"/>Suppose a <i class="calibre10">German</i>, a <i class="calibre10">Frenchman</i>, and a <i class="calibre10">Spaniard</i> to come into a room, where there are plac'd upon the table three bottles of wine, <i class="calibre10">Rhenish, Burgundy</i> and <i class="calibre10">Port</i>; and suppose they shou'd fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou'd naturally, to shew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession.<br class="calibre3"/>In all these cases, and particularly that of accession, there is first a natural union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object, and afterward a new and <i class="calibre10">moral</i> union produc'd by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has been employ'd on the present subject. I have already observ'd, that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former use than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which relates objects are connected together, it shou'd naturally be imagin'd, that the right of accession must encrease in strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform'd with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir'd the property of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; hence the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and shou'd connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is always found to be otherwise. The empire of <i class="calibre10">Great Britain</i> seems to draw along with it the dominion of the <i class="calibre10">Orkneys</i>, the <i class="calibre10">Hebrides</i>, the isle of <i class="calibre10">Man</i>, and the isle of <i class="calibre10">Wight</i>; but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to <i class="calibre10">Great Britain</i>. In short, a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never suppos'd to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It may therefore be thought, that these phænomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, <i class="calibre10">that the ascribing of property to accession it nothing but an effect of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth transition of the imagination</i>.<br class="calibre3"/>'Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be consider`d as the property of the person, we are apt to join them together, and place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider'd together, because he is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both, consider'd together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole. And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and not great to small.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because 'tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases, property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have properly no more ground or union with the land, than the <i class="calibre10">pacific</i> ocean wou'd have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the sane time <i class="calibre10">inferior</i>, they are of course regarded as an accession.<br class="calibre3"/>The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the <i class="calibre10">Rhine</i> or the <i class="calibre10">Danube</i>, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are considered as the property of that nation, thru' whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy.<br class="calibre3"/>The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided it be made by what they call <i class="calibre10">alluvion</i>, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join'd to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not sufficiently join them.<br class="calibre3"/>There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of <i class="calibre10">separation</i>. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong.<br class="calibre3"/>Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of <i class="calibre10">division</i>, but not of <i class="calibre10">separation</i>, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos'd to be common betwixt the proprietors of the several parts and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the Roman law, in distinguishing betwixt <i class="calibre10">confusion</i> and <i class="calibre10">commixtion</i>. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each; this is the reason, why the <i class="calibre10">civil</i> law, tho' it establish'd an entire community in the case of <i class="calibre10">confusion</i>, and after that a proportional division, yet in the case of <i class="calibre10">commixtion</i>, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division.<br class="calibre3"/><i class="calibre10">Quod si frementum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex voluntale vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana, quæ cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt. Quod si casu id mistrum fuerit, vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate, non videtur id commune esse; quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant. Sed nec magis istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis, si pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint. Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id frumentum retineatur, in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusquem competit. Arbitrio autem judicis, ut ipse æstimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit.</i> Inst. Lib. II. Tit. 1. § 28.<br class="calibre3"/>Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of <i class="calibre10">division</i> nor <i class="calibre10">separation</i>, as when one builds a house on another's ground, in that case, the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv'd to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas'd to call the most considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination.<br class="calibre3"/>This quality depends on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its existence is more separate and independent. 'Twill be easy to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoin'd and oppos'd in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be imagin'd, there will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc'd, that 'tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of municipal laws, to what the principles of human nature have left undetermin'd.<br class="calibre3"/>The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These decisions do not well agree together, and a proof of the contrariety of those principles, from which they are deriv'd.<br class="calibre3"/>But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of <i class="calibre10">Proculus</i> and <i class="calibre10">Sabinus</i>. Suppose a person shou'd make a cup from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou'd demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship. <i class="calibre10">Sabinus</i> maintain'd the affirmative, and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and dependent. On the other hand, <i class="calibre10">Proculus</i> observ'd, that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that 'tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin'd. I shall therefore content my self with observing, that the decision of <i class="calibre10">Trebonian</i> seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this reason may seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fix'd and unalterable.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> In examining the different titles to authority in government, we shall meet with many reasons to convince us, that the right of succession depends, in a great measure, on the imagination. Mean while I shall rest contented with observing one example, which belongs to the present subject. Suppose that a person die without children, and that a dispute arises among is relations conceding his inheritance; 'tis evident, that if his riches be deriv'd partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his possessions, and assign each part to the family, from whence it is deriv'd. Now as the person is suppos'd to have been once the full and entire proprietor of those goods; I ask, what is it makes us find a certain equity and natural reason in this partition, except it be the imagination? His affection to these families does not depend upon his possessions; for which reason his consent can never be presum'd precisely for such a partition. And as to the public interest, it seems not to be in the least concern'd on the one side or the other.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> Were morality discoverable by reason, and not by sentiment, twou'd be still more evident, that promises cou'd make no alteration upon it. Morality is suppos'd to consist in relation. Every new imposition of morality, therefore, must arise from some new relation of objects; and consequently the will cou'd not produce <i class="calibre10">immediately</i> any change in morals, but cou'd have that effect only by producing a change upon the objects. But as the moral obligation of a promise is the pure effect of the will, without the least change in any part of the universe; it follows, that promises have no <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation.<br class="calibre3"/>Shou'd it be said, that this act of the will being in effect a new object, produces new relations and new duties; I won' answer, that this is a pure sophism, which may be detected by a very moderate share of accuracy and exactness. To will a new obligation, is to will a new relation of objects; and therefore, if this new relation of objects were form'd by the volition itself, we shou'd in effect will the volition; which is plainly absurd and impossible. The will has here no object to which it cou'd tend; but must return upon itself <i class="calibre10">in infinitum</i>. The new obligation depends upon new relations. The new relations depend upon a new volition. The new volition has for object a new obligation, and consequently new relations, and consequently a new volition; which volition again has in view a new obligation, relation and volition, without any termination 'Tis impossible. therefore, we cou'd ever will a new obligation; and consequently 'tis impossible the will cou'd ever accompany a promise, or produce a new obligation of morality.</p></dd></dl>
