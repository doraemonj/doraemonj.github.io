		<p class="block_6 en">As all the perceptions of the mind may be divided into <i class="calibre10">impressions</i> and <i class="calibre10">ideas</i>, so the impressions admit of another division into <i class="calibre10">original</i> and <i class="calibre10">secondary</i>. This division of the impressions is the same with that which<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-4" id="calibre_link-197" title="48">48</a></sup> I formerly made use of when I distinguish'd them into impressions of <i class="calibre10">sensation</i> and <i class="calibre10">reflection</i>. Original impressions or impressions of sensation are such as without any antecedent perception arise in the soul, from the constitution of the body, from the animal spirits, or from the application of objects to the external organs. Secondary, or reflective impressions are such as proceed from some of these original ones, either immediately or by the interposition of its idea. Of the first kind are all the impressions of the senses, and all bodily pains and pleasures: Of the second are the passions, and other emotions resembling them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由于心灵的所有感知都可以分为<i class="calibre10">印象</i>和<i class="calibre10">观念</i>，所以印象也可以分为<i class="calibre10">原始</i>和<i class="calibre10">次要</i>。这种印象的划分与我以前把它们分为感觉的印象时所用的划分是一样的。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-4" id="calibre_link-197" title="48">48</a></sup>印象的这种划分与我以前把它们分为<i class="calibre10">感觉</i>和<i class="calibre10">思考</i>的印象时所用的划分相同。原始印象或感觉印象是指从身体的构造、动物的精神、或从物体对外部器官的应用中，在灵魂中产生的没有任何先验的感觉。次要的，或者说反射性的印象，是指从这些原始印象中的某些印象中，立即或通过其观念的介入而产生的。第一类是所有感官的印象，以及所有身体上的痛苦和快乐。第二种是激情，以及与之相似的其他情感。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis certain, that the mind, in its perceptions, must begin somewhere; and that since the impressions precede their correspondent ideas, there must be some impressions, which without any introduction make their appearance in the soul. As these depend upon natural and physical causes, the examination of them wou'd lead me too far from my present subject, into the sciences of anatomy and natural philosophy. For this reason I shall here confine myself to those other impressions, which I have call'd secondary and reflective, as arising either from the original impressions, or from their ideas. Bodily pains and pleasures are the source of many passions, both when felt and consider'd by the mind; but arise originally in the soul, or in the body, whichever you please to call it, without any preceding thought or perception. A fit of the gout produces a long train of passions, as grief, hope, fear; but is not deriv'd immediately from any affection or idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">可以肯定的是，心灵的感知必须从某处开始；既然印象先于其相应的观念，那么一定有一些印象，不经任何介绍就出现在灵魂中。由于这些取决于自然和物理原因，对它们的研究会使我偏离我目前的主题，进入解剖学和自然哲学的科学。由于这个原因，我将在这里把自己限制在那些其他的印象上，我把这些印象称为次要的和反射性的，因为它们是由原始印象或由它们的观念产生的。身体上的疼痛和快乐是许多激情的源泉，无论是由心灵感受到的还是由心灵考虑到的；但它最初是在灵魂中产生的，或者是在身体中产生的，无论你怎么称呼它，都没有任何先期的思想或感知。痛风发作时，会产生一长串的激情，如悲痛、希望、恐惧；但并不是立即从任何感情或想法中衍生出来的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The reflective impressions may be divided into two kinds, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">calm</i> and the <i class="calibre10">violent</i>. Of the first kind is the sense of beauty and deformity in action, composition, and external objects. Of the second are the passions of love and hatred, grief and joy, pride and humility. This division is far from being exact. The raptures of poetry and music frequently rise to the greatest height; while those other impressions, properly called <i class="calibre10">passions</i>, may decay into so soft an emotion, as to become, in a manner, imperceptible. But as in general the passions are more violent than the emotions arising from beauty and deformity, these impressions have been commonly distinguish'd from each other. The subject of the human mind being so copious and various, I shall here take advantage of this vulgar and specious division, that I may proceed with the greater order; and having said all I thought necessary conceding our ideas, shall now explain those violent emotions or passions, their nature, origin, causes, and effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">反射性的印象可以分为两种，<i class="calibre10">即</i> <i class="calibre10">平静的</i>和<i class="calibre10">激烈的</i>。第一种是对动作、构图和外部物体的美感和畸形的感觉。第二种是爱与恨、悲与喜、傲慢与谦逊的激情。这种划分远远不够精确。诗歌和音乐的狂欢常常上升到最高点；而那些其他的印象，正确地称为<i class="calibre10">激情</i>，可能会衰落成如此柔和的情感，以至于在某种程度上变得难以察觉。但是，由于一般来说，激情比由美和畸形产生的情感更猛烈，这些印象通常被相互区分开来。人类心灵的主题是如此丰富和多样，我将在此利用这种粗俗和似是而非的划分，以便我可以更有秩序地进行；在说了我认为有必要承认我们的想法之后，现在将解释那些暴力的情绪或激情，它们的性质、起源、原因和影响。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">When we take a survey of the passions, there occurs a division of them into <i class="calibre10">direct</i> and <i class="calibre10">indirect</i>. By direct passions I understand such as arise immediately from good or evil, from pain or pleasure. By indirect such as proceed from the same principles, but by the conjunction of other qualities. This distinction I cannot at present justify or explain any farther. I can only observe in general, that under the indirect passions I comprehend pride, humility, ambition, vanity, love, hatred, envy, pity, malice, generosity, with their dependants. And under the direct passions, desire, aversion, grief, joy hope, fear, despair and security. I shall began with the former.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">当我们对激情进行调查时，会发现它们被分为<i class="calibre10">直接</i>和<i class="calibre10">间接</i>两种。我所理解的直接激情是指从善或恶，从痛苦或快乐中立即产生的激情。间接的激情是指从同样的原则出发，但通过与其他品质的结合而产生的激情。这种区别目前我无法证明或进一步解释。我只能笼统地指出，在间接激情下，我包括骄傲、谦逊、野心、虚荣、爱、恨、嫉妒、怜悯、恶意、慷慨，以及它们的附属品。而在直接激情下，欲望、厌恶、悲伤、快乐、希望、恐惧、绝望和安全。我将从前者开始。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The passions of pride and humility being simple and uniform impressions, 'tis impossible we can ever, by a multitude of words, give a just definition of them, or indeed of any of the passions. The utmost we can pretend to is a description of them, by an enumeration of such circumstances, as attend them: But as these words, <i class="calibre10">pride</i> and <i class="calibre10">humility</i>, are of general use, and the impressions they represent the most common of any, every one, of himself, will be able to form a just idea of them, without any danger of mistake.

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">骄傲和谦卑的激情是简单而统一的印象，我们不可能通过大量的文字对它们，或者说对任何一种激情作出公正的定义。我们最多只能通过列举伴随它们的情况，来描述它们。但是，由于<i class="calibre10">骄傲</i>和<i class="calibre10">谦卑</i>这两个词是通用的，而且它们所代表的印象是最常见的，所以每个人都能对它们形成一个正确的概念，而没有任何错误的危险。因此，为了不在前言上浪费时间，我将立即开始对这些激情进行研究。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis evident, that pride and humility, tho' directly contrary, have yet the same object. This object is self or that succession of related ideas and impressions, of which we have an intimate memory and consciousness. Here the view always fixes when we are actuated by either of these passions. According as our idea of ourself is more or less advantageous, we feel either of those opposite affections, and are elated by pride, or dejected with humility. Whatever other objects may be comprehended by the mind, they are always consider'd with a view to ourselves; otherwise they wou'd never be able either to excite these passions, or produce the smallest encrease or diminution of them. When self enters not into the consideration, there is no room either for pride or humility.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，骄傲和谦逊虽然直接相反，但却有相同的目标。这个目标是自我或相关的想法和印象的连续，我们对其有一个亲密的记忆和意识。当我们被这两种激情中的任何一种所驱动时，观点总是固定在这里。根据我们对自己的想法是更有利还是更不利，我们会感受到这些相反的情感中的任何一种，并因骄傲而欢欣鼓舞，或因谦卑而颓废。无论头脑中的其他对象是什么，它们总是以我们自己为中心来考虑的；否则，它们永远不可能激起这些激情，也不可能产生最小的增加或减少。如果不考虑自我，就不会有骄傲或谦卑的空间。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' that connected succession of perceptions, which we call <i class="calibre10">self</i>, be always the object of these two passions, 'tis impossible it can be their cause, or be sufficient alone to excite them. For as these passions are directly contrary, and have the same object in common; were their object also their cause; it cou'd never produce any degree of the one passion, but at the same time it must excite an equal degree of the other; which opposition and contrariety must destroy both. 'Tis impossible a man can at the same time be both proud and humble; and where he has different reasons for these passions, as frequently happens, the passions either take place alternately; or if they encounter, the one annihilates the other, as far as its strength goes, and the remainder only of that, which is superior, continues to operate upon the mind. But in the present case neither of the passions cou'd ever become superior; because supposing it to be the view only of ourself, which excited them, that being perfectly indifferent to either, must produce both in the very same proportion; or in other words, can produce neither. To excite any passion, and at the same time raise an equal share of its antagonist, is immediately to undo what was done, and must leave the mind at last perfectly calm and indifferent.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管我们称之为<i class="calibre10">自我的</i>那一连串的感知总是这两种激情的对象，但它不可能成为它们的原因，也不可能仅仅足以激起它们。因为这两种激情是直接相反的，而且有共同的对象；如果它们的对象也是它们的原因，那么它就永远不会产生任何程度的一种激情，但同时它必须激发同等程度的另一种激情；这种对立和矛盾必须摧毁这两种激情。一个人不可能在同一时间既骄傲又谦卑；如果他有不同的理由产生这些激情，就像经常发生的那样，这些激情要么交替发生，要么如果它们相遇，一个人就其力量而言消灭了另一个人，只有剩余的那个人，即高人，继续作用于头脑。但在目前的情况下，这两种激情都不可能成为优势；因为如果仅仅是对我们自己的看法激发了它们，那么对任何一种激情都完全无动于衷，必须以同样的比例产生两种激情；或者换句话说，两种激情都不能产生。在激发任何激情的同时，对它的对立面也产生同样的份额，就会立即使所做的事情付诸东流，最后必须使头脑完全平静和无动于衷。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We must, therefore, make a distinction betwixt the cause and the object of these passions; betwixt that idea, which excites them, and that to which they direct their view, when excited. Pride and humility, being once rais'd, immediately turn our attention to ourself, and regard that as their ultimate and final object; but there is something farther requisite in order to raise them: Something, which is peculiar to one of the passions, and produces not both in the very same degree. The first idea, that is presented to the mind, is that of the cause or productive principle. This excites the passion, connected with it; and that passion, when excited, turns our view to another idea, which is that of self Here then is a passion plac'd betwixt two ideas, of which the one produces it, and the other is produc'd by it. The first idea, therefore, represents the <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, the second the <i class="calibre10">object</i> of the passion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们必须区分这些激情的原因和对象；区分激发它们的想法和它们被激发后所指向的东西。骄傲和谦卑一旦被唤起，就会立即把我们的注意力转向我们自己，并把它作为它们的最终目标；但要唤起它们，还需要一些其他的东西。但为了提高它们，还需要一些东西：一些为其中一种激情所特有的东西，而不是在同一程度上产生这两种激情。呈现在人们脑海中的第一个想法，是关于原因或生产原则的想法。这就激发了与之相关的激情；而这种激情一旦被激发，就会把我们的视线转向另一个观念，也就是自我的观念。因此，第一个观念代表了激情的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>，第二个观念代表了激情的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the causes of pride and humility; we may observe, that their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of subjects, on which they may be plac'd. Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the causes of pride; and their opposites of humility. Nor are these passions confin'd to the mind, but extend their view to the body likewise. A man may be proud of his beauty, strength, agility, good mein, address in dancing, riding, fencing, and of his dexterity in any manual business or manufacture. But this is not all. The passion looking farther, comprehend whatever objects are in the least ally'd or related to us. Our country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, cloaths; any of these may become a cause either of pride or of humility.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在开始讨论骄傲和谦逊的原因时，我们可以注意到，它们最明显和最显著的特性是它们可以被放在各种各样的主题上。心灵的每一个有价值的品质，无论是想象力、判断力、记忆力还是性格；智慧、理智、学识、勇气、正义、正直；所有这些都是骄傲的原因；而它们的对立面则是谦逊。这些激情也不局限于心灵，而是同样延伸到身体。一个人可以为他的美貌、力量、敏捷、好脾气、在舞蹈、骑马、击剑中的表现，以及在任何手工业务或制造业中的灵巧而感到骄傲。但这还不是全部。激情可以看得更远，包括任何与我们有关联的物体。我们的国家、家庭、孩子、亲戚、财富、房子、花园、马、狗、外套；任何这些都可能成为骄傲或谦卑的原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">From the consideration of these causes, it appears necessary we shou'd make a new distinction in the causes of the passion, betwixt that <i class="calibre10">quality</i>, which operates, and the <i class="calibre10">subject</i>, on which it is plac'd. A man, for instance, is vain of a beautiful house, which belongs to him, or which he has himself built and contriv'd. Here the object of the passion is himself, and the cause is the beautiful house: Which cause again is sub-divided into two parts, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the quality, which operates upon the passion, and the subject, in which the quality inheres. The quality is the beauty, and the subject is the house, consider'd as his property or contrivance. Both these parts are essential, nor is the distinction vain and chimerical. Beauty, consider'd merely as such, unless plac'd upon something related to us, never produces any pride or vanity; and the strongest relation alone, without beauty, or something else in its place, has as little influence on that passion. Since, therefore, these two particulars are easily separated, and there is a necessity for their conjunction, in order to produce the passion, we ought to consider them as component parts of the cause; and infix in our minds an exact idea of this distinction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从对这些原因的考虑来看，我们似乎有必要在激情的原因上做一个新的区分，即在起作用的<i class="calibre10">品质</i>和它所处的<i class="calibre10">主体</i>之间进行区分。例如，一个人对属于他的或他自己建造和设计的漂亮房子感到虚荣。在这里，激情的对象是他自己，而原因是那座漂亮的房子。这个原因又被细分为两个部分，<i class="calibre10">即</i>作用于激情的质量和质量所包含的主体。质量就是美，而主体就是房子，被视为他的财产或设计。这两个部分都是必不可少的，这种区分也不是虚妄的和嵌套的。美，仅仅被认为是这样的，除非放在与我们有关的东西上，否则永远不会产生任何骄傲或虚荣；而仅仅是最强的关系，如果没有美，或者有其他东西代替它，对这种激情的影响也很小。因此，既然这两个特点很容易分开，而且为了产生激情，它们有必要结合起来，我们就应该把它们看作是原因的组成部分；并在我们的头脑中注入这种区别的确切概念。</p></div>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident in the first place, that these passions are determin'd to have self for their <i class="calibre10">object</i>, not only by a natural but also by an original property. No one can doubt but this property is <i class="calibre10">natural</i> from the constancy and steadiness of its operations. 'Tis always self, which is the object of pride and humility; and whenever the passions look beyond, 'tis still with a view to ourselves, nor can any person or object otherwise have any influence upon us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先很明显的是，这些激情是以自我为<i class="calibre10">目标</i>的，这不仅是由一个自然的，而且是由一个原始的属性决定的。从其运作的恒定性和稳定性来看，没有人会怀疑这种属性是<i class="calibre10">自然的</i>。骄傲和谦卑的对象永远是自己；无论何时，激情都是以自己为目标，任何个人或物体都不能对我们产生任何影响。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That this proceeds from an <i class="calibre10">original</i> quality or primary impulse, will likewise appear evident, if we consider that 'tis the distinguishing characteristic of these passions. Unless nature had given some original qualities to the mind, it cou'd never have any secondary ones; because in that case it wou'd have no foundation for action, nor cou'd ever begin to exert itself. Now these qualities, which we must consider as original, are such as are most inseparable from the soul, and can be resolv'd into no other: And such is the quality, which determines the object of pride and humility.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我们考虑到这是这些激情的显著特征，那么这来自于一种<i class="calibre10">原始的</i>品质或主要的冲动，同样也会显得很明显。除非大自然赋予心灵一些原始的品质，否则它永远不会有任何次要的品质；因为在这种情况下，它将没有行动的基础，也永远不会开始发挥自己的作用。现在，这些我们必须认为是原始的品质，是那些与灵魂最不可分割的，而且不能被分解成其他的品质。这就是决定骄傲和谦逊的对象的品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may, perhaps, make it a greater question, whether the <i class="calibre10">causes</i>, that produce the passion, be as <i class="calibre10">natural</i> as the object, to which it is directed, and whether all that vast variety proceeds from caprice or from the constitution of the mind. This doubt we shall soon remove, if we cast our eye upon human nature, and consider that in all nations and ages, the same objects still give rise to pride and humility; and that upon the view even of a stranger, we can know pretty nearly, what will either encrease or diminish his passions of this kind. If there be any variation in this particular, it proceeds from nothing but a difference in the tempers and complexions of men; and is besides very inconsiderable. Can we imagine it possible, that while human nature remains the same, men will ever become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit, and that their pride and vanity will not be affected by these advantages?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们也许可以提出一个更大的问题：产生这种激情的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>是否与它所指向的对象一样<i class="calibre10">自然</i>，以及所有这些巨大的变化是来自于任性还是来自于心灵的构造。如果我们把目光投向人性，并考虑到在所有国家和时代中，同样的对象仍然会引起骄傲和谦卑；甚至在观察一个陌生人的时候，我们就可以很清楚地知道，什么会增加或减少他的这种激情，那么这个疑问很快就会消除。如果在这一点上有任何变化，那也只是源于人的脾气和肤色的不同，而且是非常微不足道的。我们能否想象，在人性不变的情况下，人们会不会对他们的权力、财富、美貌或个人功绩完全漠不关心，他们的骄傲和虚荣心会不会受到这些优势的影响？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' the causes of pride and humility be plainly <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, we shall find upon examination, that they are not <i class="calibre10">original</i>, and that 'tis utterly impossible they shou'd each of them be adapted to these passions by a particular provision, and primary constitution of nature. Beside their prodigious number, many of them are the effects of art, and arise partly from the industry, partly from the caprice, and partly from the good fortune of men. Industry produces houses, furniture, cloaths. Caprice determines their particular kinds and qualities. And good fortune frequently contributes to all this, by discovering the effects that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies. 'Tis absurd, therefore, to imagine, that each of these was foreseen and provided for by nature, and that every new production of art, which causes pride or humility; instead of adapting itself to the passion by partaking of some general quality, that naturally operates on the mind; is itself the object of an original principle, which till then lay conceal'd in the soul, and is only by accident at last brought to light. Thus the first mechanic, that invented a fine scritoire, produc'd pride in him, who became possest of it, by principles different from those, which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables. As this appears evidently ridiculous, we must conclude, that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality; but that there are some one or more circumstances common to all of them, on which their efficacy depends.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管骄傲和谦逊的原因显然是<i class="calibre10">自然的</i>，但我们在研究后会发现，它们不是<i class="calibre10">原始的</i>，而且它们完全不可能通过特定的规定和自然界的主要构成来适应这些激情。除了数量庞大之外，它们中的许多都是艺术的效果，部分来自于工业，部分来自于任性，部分来自于人的好运气。工业生产房屋、家具和衣着。任性决定了它们的特殊种类和质量。运气好的人经常对这一切有所贡献，因为他们发现了由不同的混合物和组合体所产生的效果。因此，想象这些东西都是自然界所预见和规定的，而且每一个引起骄傲或谦逊的艺术新产品，不是通过吸收一些自然作用于心灵的一般品质来适应激情，而是本身就是一个原始原则的对象，而这个原则一直隐藏在灵魂中，只是在最后才被意外地揭示出来。因此，第一个发明了精美书架的机械师，在他身上产生了自豪感，因为他拥有的原则与那些使他对漂亮的椅子和桌子感到自豪的原则不同。由于这显然是荒谬的，我们必须得出结论，导致骄傲和谦逊的每一个原因都不是通过一个独特的原始品质来适应激情的；而是有一些对所有这些原因来说共同的一个或多个情况，它们的效力取决于此。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Besides, we find in the course of nature, that tho' the effects be many, the principles, from which they arise, are commonly but few and simple, and that 'tis the sign of an unskilful naturalist to have recourse to a different quality, in order to explain every different operation. How much more must this be true with regard to the human mind, which being so confin'd a subject may justly be thought incapable of containing such a monstrous heap of principles, as wou'd be necessary to excite the passions of pride and humility, were each distinct cause adapted to the passion by a distinct set of principles?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，我们在自然界中发现，虽然效果很多，但产生这些效果的原理通常很少，而且很简单，而且一个不熟练的自然学家为了解释每一个不同的操作，必须求助于不同的质量，这是一个标志。对于人类的思想来说，这又何尝不是如此呢？人类的思想是如此狭小的一个主题，人们有理由认为它不可能包含如此多的原则，就像激发骄傲和谦逊的激情所必需的那样，如果每个不同的原因都有一套不同的原则来适应这种激情的话，那就更不可能了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here, therefore, moral philosophy is in the same condition as natural, with regard to astronomy before the time of <i class="calibre10">Copernicus</i>. The antients, tho' sensible of that maxim, <i class="calibre10">that nature does nothing in vain</i>, contriv'd such intricate systems of the heavens, as seem'd inconsistent with true philosophy, and gave place at last to something more simple and natural. To invent without scruple a new principle to every new phenomenon, instead of adapting it to the old; to overload our hypotheses with a variety of this kind; are certain proofs, that none of these principles is the just one, and that we only desire, by a number of falsehoods, to cover our ignorance of the truth.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在这里，道德哲学与自然哲学的状况相同，在<i class="calibre10">哥白尼</i>时代之前的天文学方面也是如此。古人虽然知道那句格言，<i class="calibre10">即自然界没有什么</i>是徒劳的，但还是设计了如此复杂的天体系统，这似乎与真正的哲学不一致，并最终让位于更简单和自然的东西。毫无顾忌地为每一个新的现象发明一个新的原理，而不是让它适应旧的原理；让我们的假说充满了各种各样的东西；这些都肯定地证明，这些原理没有一个是公正的，而我们只是想通过一些虚假的东西来掩盖我们对真理的无知。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们已经毫无障碍地确立了两个真理，<i class="calibre10">那就是各种原因激起骄傲和谦卑是出于自然的原则，</i>而<i class="calibre10">每个不同的原因适应其激情并不是通过不同的原则</i>。现在我们将着手研究如何将这些原则减少到较少的数量，并在各种原因中找到它们的影响所依赖的共同点。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to this we must reflect on certain properties of human nature, which tho' they have a mighty influence on every operation both of the understanding and passions, are not commonly much insisted on by philosophers. The <i class="calibre10">first</i> of these is the association of ideas, which I have so often observ'd and explain'd. 'Tis impossible for the mind to fix itself steadily upon one idea for any considerable time; nor can it by its utmost efforts ever arrive at such a constancy. But however changeable our thoughts may be, they are not entirely without rule and method in their changes. The rule, by which they proceed, is to pass from one object to what is resembling, contiguous to, or produc'd by it. When one idea is present to the imagination, any other, united by these relations, naturally follows it, and enters with more facility by means of that introduction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了做到这一点，我们必须反思人性中的某些特性，这些特性虽然对理解力和激情的每项操作都有很大的影响，但哲学家们通常不大坚持。其中<i class="calibre10">第一项</i>就是我经常观察和解释的观念的联系。心灵不可能在相当长的时间内将自己稳定地固定在一个想法上；它也不可能通过最大的努力达到这样一种恒定。但无论我们的思想如何变化，它们的变化并非完全没有规则和方法。它们所遵循的规则是，从一个对象转到与之相似的、相邻的或由之产生的对象。当一个想法出现在想象力中时，任何其他的想法，通过这些关系结合在一起，自然会跟随它，并通过这种引入更容易进入。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">second</i> property I shall observe in the human mind is a like association of impressions. All resembling impressions are connected together, and no sooner one arises than the rest immediately follow. Grief and disappointment give rise to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again, till the whole circle be compleated. In like manner our temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throws itself into love, generosity, pity, courage, pride, and the other resembling affections. 'Tis difficult for the mind, when actuated by any passion, to confine itself to that passion alone, without any change or variation. Human nature is too inconstant to admit of any such regularity. Changeableness is essential to it. And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail? 'Tis evident, then, there is an attraction or association among impressions, as well as among ideas; tho' with this remarkable difference, that ideas are associated by resemblance, contiguity, and causation; and impressions only by resemblance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我将在人的头脑中观察到的<i class="calibre10">第二个</i>特性是印象的类似关联。所有相似的印象都联系在一起，只要有一个印象出现，其他的印象就会立即出现。悲伤和失望引起愤怒，愤怒引起嫉妒，嫉妒引起恶意，恶意又引起悲伤，直到整个循环完成。同样地，我们的脾气，当因喜悦而升高时，自然而然地投入到爱、慷慨、怜悯、勇气、骄傲和其他类似的情感中。心灵在被任何激情驱动时，很难仅仅局限于这种激情，而没有任何变化或改变。人类的本性太不稳定了，不允许有任何这样的规律性。变化性对它来说是必不可少的。那么，它能自然而然地改变什么呢？它能自然而然地改变情感或情绪，这些情感或情绪适合于它的脾气，并与当时占主导地位的那套激情相一致。那么，很明显，印象和观念之间存在着吸引力或联系；但有一个显著的区别，即观念是通过相似性、相邻性和因果关系联系起来的；而印象只是通过相似性联系起来的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In the <i class="calibre10">third</i> place, 'tis observable of these two kinds of association, that they very much assist and forward each other, and that the transition is more easily made where they both concur in the same object. Thus a man, who, by any injury from another, is very much discompos'd and ruffled in his temper, is apt to find a hundred subjects of discontent, impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions; especially if he can discover these subjects in or near the person, who was the cause of his first passion. Those principles, which forward the transition of ideas, here concur with those, which operate on the passions; and both uniting in one action, bestow on the mind a double impulse. The new passion, therefore, must arise with so much greater violence, and the transition to it must be render'd so much more easy and natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">第三</i>，从这两种关联中可以看出，它们在很大程度上是相互帮助和促进的，而且在它们都符合同一目标的情况下更容易实现过渡。因此，一个人，如果受到他人的伤害，他的脾气非常不稳定，很容易找到一百个不满、不耐烦、恐惧和其他不安的激情的对象；特别是如果他能在这个人身上或附近发现这些对象，这个人是他第一次激情的原因。那些推动思想转变的原则，在这里与那些对激情起作用的原则相一致；两者结合在一起，给心灵以双重的推动力。因此，新的激情必须以更大的力度出现，而向它的过渡也必须变得更加容易和自然。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Upon this occasion I may cite the authority of an elegant writer, who expresses himself in the following manner. 'As the fancy delights in every thing that is great, strange, or beautiful, and is still more pleas'd the more it finds of these perfections in the <i class="calibre10">same</i> object, so it is capable of receiving a new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense. Thus any continu'd sound, as the music of binds, or a fall of waters, awakens every moment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to the several beauties of the place, that lie before him. Thus if there arises a fragrance of smells or perfumes, they heighten the pleasure of the imagination, and make even the colours and verdure of the landscape appear more agreeable; for the ideas of both senses recommend each other, and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately: As the different colours of a picture, when they are well disposed, set off one another, and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the situation.’ In this phænomenon we may remark the association both of impressions and ideas, as well as the mutual assistance they lend each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这种情况下，我可以引用一位优雅作家的权威，他用以下方式表达了自己的观点。正如想象力对每一件伟大的、奇怪的或美丽的事物感到高兴，并且在<i class="calibre10">同一</i>物体中发现更多的这些完美之处，就会更加高兴，所以它能够通过另一种感官的帮助获得新的满足。因此，任何持续的声音，如捆绑的音乐，或水的落下，都会随时唤醒观察者的心灵，使他更加注意眼前的各种美感。因此，如果出现了气味或香水的香味，它们就会增强想象力的乐趣，甚至使风景的颜色和青翠显得更令人愉快；因为两种感官的想法相互推荐，在一起比它们单独进入头脑时更令人愉快。就像一幅画中的不同颜色，当它们被很好地安排好时，就会相互衬托，并因环境的优势而获得额外的美感'。在这个现象中，我们可以注意到印象和观念的关联，以及它们之间的相互帮助。</p></div>

<div class="top right">

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">These principles being establish'd on unquestionable experience, I begin to consider how we shall apply them, by revolving over all the causes of pride and humility, whether these causes be regarded, as the qualities, that operate, or as the subjects, on which the qualities are plac'd. In examining these <i class="calibre10">qualities</i> I immediately find many of them to concur in producing the sensation of pain and pleasure, independent of those affections, which I here endeavour to explain. Thus the beauty of our person, of itself, and by its very appearance, gives pleasure, as well as pride; and its deformity, pain as well as humility. A magnificent feast delights us, and a sordid one displeases. What I discover to be true in some instances, I <i class="calibre10">suppose</i> to be so in all; and take it for granted at present, without any farther proof, that every cause of pride, by its peculiar qualities, produces a separate pleasure, and of humility a separate uneasiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这些原则是在无可置疑的经验基础上建立起来的，我开始考虑我们应该如何应用这些原则，方法是在所有导致骄傲和谦卑的原因上旋转，无论这些原因是被视为运作的品质，还是被视为这些品质所寄予的主体。在检查这些<i class="calibre10">品质</i>时，我立即发现其中许多品质同时产生了痛苦和快乐的感觉，与我在此努力解释的那些情感无关。因此，我们人的美貌本身，以及它的外表，给人以快乐和骄傲；而它的畸形，给人以痛苦和谦卑。一场华丽的盛宴让我们高兴，而一场肮脏的盛宴则让我们不高兴。我发现在某些情况下是真实的，我<i class="calibre10">认为</i>在所有情况下都是如此；目前我认为这是理所当然的，无需进一步证明，每一个导致骄傲的原因，由于其特殊的品质，都会产生单独的快乐，而谦逊则会产生单独的不安。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Again, in considering the <i class="calibre10">subjects</i>, to which these qualities adhere, I make a new <i class="calibre10">supposition</i>, which also appears probable from many obvious instances, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that these subjects are either parts of ourselves, or something nearly related to us. Thus the good and bad qualities of our actions and manners constitute virtue and vice, and determine our personal character, than which nothing operates more strongly on these passions. In like manner, 'tis the beauty or deformity of our person, houses, equipage, or furniture, by which we are render'd either vain or humble. The same qualities, when transfer'd to subjects, which bear us no relation, influence not in the smallest degree either of these affections.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">另外，在考虑这些品质所依附的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>时，我做了一个新的<i class="calibre10">假设</i>，从许多明显的例子中也可以看出<i class="calibre10">，</i>这些对象要么是我们自己的一部分，要么是与我们几乎相关的东西。因此，我们行为和举止的好坏构成了美德和恶习，并决定了我们的个人性格，没有什么比这更强烈地影响这些激情了。同样，我们的人格、房屋、装备或家具的美丽或畸形，也会使我们变得虚荣或卑微。同样的品质，当转移到与我们没有关系的对象上时，对这两种情感的影响也是微乎其微的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Having thus in a manner suppos'd two properties of the causes of these affections, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that the <i class="calibre10">qualities</i> produce a separate pain or pleasure, and that the <i class="calibre10">subjects</i>, on which the qualities are plac'd, are related to self; I proceed to examine the passions themselves, in order to find something in them, correspondent to the suppos'd properties of their causes. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, I find, that the peculiar object of pride and humility is determin'd by an original and natural instinct, and that 'tis absolutely impossible, from the primary constitution of the mind, that these passions shou'd ever look beyond self, or that individual person, of whose actions and sentiments each of us is intimately conscious. Here at last the view always rests, when we are actuated by either of these passions; nor can we, in that situation of mind, ever lose sight of this object. For this I pretend not to give any reason; but consider such a peculiar direction of the thought as an original quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这样假设了这些情感的原因的两个属性之后，<i class="calibre10">即</i>这些<i class="calibre10">品质</i>产生了单独的痛苦或快乐，以及这些品质所寄托的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>与自我有关；我开始研究这些激情本身，以便在其中找到与它们的原因的假设属性相一致的东西。<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，我发现，骄傲和谦卑的特殊对象是由一种原始和自然的本能决定的，而且从心灵的基本结构来看，这些激情绝对不可能超越自我，或者超越我们每个人都密切意识到的个人的行为和情感。当我们被这些激情所驱使时，我们的视线始终停留在这里；在这种心境下，我们也不可能忽视这个目标。对于这一点，我不打算给出任何理由；但我认为这种特殊的思想方向是一种原始的品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">second</i> quality, which I discover in these passions, and which I likewise consider as an original quality, is their sensations, or the peculiar emotions they excite in the soul, and which constitute their very being and essence. Thus pride is a pleasant sensation, and humility a painful; and upon the removal of the pleasure and pain, there is in reality no pride nor humility. Of this our very feeling convinces us; and beyond our feeling, 'tis here in vain to reason or dispute.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我在这些激情中发现的<i class="calibre10">第二种</i>品质，也是我认为的一种原始品质，就是它们的感觉，或者说它们在灵魂中激发的特殊情感，这些情感构成了它们的存在和本质。因此，骄傲是一种愉快的感觉，而谦卑是一种痛苦的感觉；在消除了快乐和痛苦之后，实际上就没有骄傲和谦卑了。我们的感觉使我们确信这一点；而在我们的感觉之外，推理或争论都是徒劳的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If I compare, therefore, these two <i class="calibre10">establish’d</i> properties of the passions, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> their object, which is self, and their sensation, which is either pleasant or painful, to the two <i class="calibre10">suppos’d</i> properties of the causes, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> their relation to sell, and their tendency to produce a pain or pleasure, independent of the passion; I immediately find, that taking these suppositions to be just, the true system breaks in upon me with an irresistible evidence. That cause, which excites the passion, is related to the object, which nature has attributed to the passion; the sensation, which the cause separately produces, is related to the sensation of the passion: From this double relation of ideas and impressions, the passion is deriv'd. The one idea is easily converted into its cor-relative; and the one impression into that, which resembles and corresponds to it: With how much greater facility must this transition be made, where these movements mutually assist each other, and the mind receives a double impulse from the relations both of its impressions and ideas?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，如果我把激情的这两个<i class="calibre10">确定的</i>属性，<i class="calibre10">即</i>它们的对象，即自己，以及它们的感觉，即愉快或痛苦，与原因的两个<i class="calibre10">假定的</i>属性，<i class="calibre10">即</i>它们与销售的关系，以及它们产生独立于激情的痛苦或快乐的趋势进行比较；我立即发现，如果这些假定是公正的，那么真正的系统就会以不可抗拒的证据向我袭来。激发激情的原因，与自然界赋予激情的对象有关；原因单独产生的感觉，与激情的感觉有关。从这种观念和印象的双重关系中，激情得到了衍生。一个理念很容易转化为它的对应物；一个印象也很容易转化为与之相似和对应的印象。如果这些运动相互帮助，心灵从印象和观念的关系中得到双重推动，那么这种转换必须要有多大的便利？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That we may comprehend this the better, we must suppose, that nature has given to the organs of the human mind, a certain disposition fitted to produce a peculiar impression or emotion, which we call <i class="calibre10">pride</i>: To this emotion she has assign'd a certain idea, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that of <i class="calibre10">self</i> which it never fails to produce. This contrivance of nature is easily conceiv'd. We have many instances of such a situation of affairs. The nerves of the nose and palate are so dispos'd, as in certain circumstances to convey such peculiar sensations to the mind: The sensations of lust and hunger always produce in us the idea of those peculiar objects, which are suitable to each appetite. These two circumstances are united in pride. The organs are so dispos'd as to produce the passion; and the passion, after its production, naturally produces a certain idea. All this needs no proof. 'Tis evident we never shou'd be possest of that passion, were there not a disposition of mind proper for it; and 'tis as evident, that the passion always turns our view to ourselves, and makes us think of our own qualities and circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了让我们更好地理解这一点，我们必须假设，大自然赋予人类心灵器官以某种倾向，使其产生一种特殊的印象或情绪，我们称之为<i class="calibre10">自豪感</i>。对于这种情绪，她赋予了某种观念，<i class="calibre10">即</i> <i class="calibre10">自我</i>的观念，而这种观念永远都会产生。自然界的这种安排是很容易想象的。我们有许多例子可以说明这种情况的发生。鼻子和上颚的神经是这样配置的，以便在某些情况下向头脑传达这种特殊的感觉。淫欲和饥饿的感觉总是在我们心中产生那些适合每种食欲的特殊物体的想法。这两种情况是在骄傲中结合在一起的。器官的配置是为了产生激情；而激情产生后，自然会产生某种想法。这一切都不需要证明。很明显，如果没有适当的心态，我们永远不可能拥有这种激情；同样明显的是，这种激情总是把我们的视线转向自己，让我们思考自己的品质和环境。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This being fully comprehended, it may now be ask'd, <i class="calibre10">Whether nature produces the passion immediately, of herself; or whether she must be assisted by the co-operation of other causes?</i> For 'tis observable, that in this particular her conduct is different in the different passions and sensations. The palate must be excited by an external object, in order to produce any relish: But hunger arises internally, without the concurrence of any external object. But however the case may stand with other passions and impressions, 'tis certain, that pride requires the assistance of some foreign object, and that the organs, which produce it, exert not themselves like the heart and arteries, by an original internal movement. For <i class="calibre10">first</i>, daily experience convinces us, that pride requires certain causes to excite it, and languishes when unsupported by some excellency in the character, in bodily accomplishments, in cloaths, equipage or fortune. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, 'tis evident pride wou'd be perpetual, if it arose immediately from nature; since the object is always the same, and there is no disposition of body peculiar to pride, as there is to thirst and hunger. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, Humility is in the very same situation with pride; and therefore, either must, upon this supposition, be perpetual likewise, or must destroy the contrary passion from the very first moment; so that none of them cou'd ever make its appearance. Upon the whole, we may rest satisfy'd with the foregoing conclusion, that pride must have a cause, as well as an object, and that the one has no influence without the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然已经完全理解了这一点，现在可以问，<i class="calibre10">自然界是自己立即产生激情，还是她必须得到其他原因的帮助？</i>因为我们可以看到，在这一点上，她的行为在不同的激情和感觉中是不同的。味觉必须被外部物体所激发，才能产生任何味觉。但是，饥饿感是在内部产生的，没有任何外部物体的参与。但无论其他激情和印象的情况如何，可以肯定的是，骄傲需要一些外来物的帮助，而产生它的器官并不像心脏和动脉那样，通过原始的内部运动来发挥自己的作用。<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，日常经验使我们相信，骄傲需要某些原因来激发它，如果没有性格、身体成就、衣着、装备或财富方面的某些优点的支持，它就会枯萎。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，很明显，如果骄傲是直接从自然中产生的，那么它将是永久的；因为目标总是相同的，而且骄傲并不像口渴和饥饿那样是身体特有的倾向。<i class="calibre10">第三</i>，谦卑与骄傲处于同样的境地；因此，根据这一假设，谦卑也必须是永久的，或者必须从一开始就摧毁相反的激情；因此，它们都不会出现。总的来说，我们可以对上述结论感到满意，即骄傲必须有一个原因，也有一个目标，一个没有另一个就没有影响。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The difficulty, then, is only to discover this cause, and find what it is that gives the first motion to pride, and sets those organs in action, which are naturally fitted to produce that emotion. Upon my consulting experience, in order to resolve this difficulty, I immediately find a hundred different causes, that produce pride; and upon examining these causes, I suppose, what at first I perceive to be probable, that all of them concur in two circumstances; which are, that of themselves they produce an impression, ally'd to the passion, and are plac'd on a subject, ally'd to the object of the passion. When I consider after this the nature of <i class="calibre10">relation</i>, and its effects both on the passions and ideas, I can no longer doubt, upon these suppositions, that 'tis the very principle, which gives rise to pride, and bestows motion on those organs, which being naturally dispos'd to produce that affection, require only a first impulse or beginning to their action. Any thing, that gives a pleasant sensation, and is related to self excites the passion of pride, which is also agreeable, and has self for its object.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，困难就在于发现这个原因，并找出是什么原因使骄傲的情绪首先产生，并使那些自然适合产生这种情绪的器官开始行动。为了解决这个难题，我查阅了经验，立即发现有一百种不同的原因会产生骄傲；在研究这些原因后，我推测，最初我认为很有可能的是，所有这些原因都有两种情况；那就是，它们本身会产生一种印象，与激情相一致，并且被放置在一个主题上，与激情的对象相一致。当我考虑到<i class="calibre10">关系</i>的性质，以及它对激情和思想的影响时，我不再怀疑，根据这些假设，它是引起骄傲的原则，并赋予这些器官以运动，这些器官天生就有能力产生这种感情，只需要一个最初的冲动或开始它们的行动。任何给人以愉快感觉的事物，如果与自己有关，就会激起骄傲的激情，这也是愉快的，并以自己为对象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">What I have said of pride is equally true of humility. The sensation of humility is uneasy, as that of pride is agreeable; for which reason the separate sensation, arising from the causes, must be revers'd, while the relation to self continues the same. Tho' pride and humility are directly contrary in their effects, and in their sensations, they have not withstanding the same object; so that 'tis requisite only to change the relation of impressions, without making any change upon that of ideas. Accordingly we find, that a beautiful house, belonging to ourselves, produces pride; and that the same house, still belonging to ourselves, produces humility, when by any accident its beauty is chang'd into deformity, and thereby the sensation of pleasure, which corresponded to pride, is transform'd into pain, which is related to humility. The double relation between the ideas and impressions subsists in both cases, and produces an easy transition from the one emotion to the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我关于骄傲的说法同样适用于谦逊。谦卑的感觉是令人不安的，因为骄傲的感觉是令人满意的；为此，由原因引起的单独的感觉必须被颠覆，而与自我的关系则继续保持不变。尽管骄傲和谦卑在它们的效果和感觉上是直接相反的，但它们的目标并不一样；因此，只需要改变印象的关系，而不需要对观念的关系做任何改变。因此，我们发现，属于我们自己的漂亮房子会产生骄傲；而同样的房子，仍然属于我们自己，会产生谦卑，当它的美丽因任何意外而变成畸形，从而使与骄傲相对应的快乐感觉转化为与谦卑相关的痛苦。观念和印象之间的双重关系在这两种情况下都存在，并产生了从一种情感到另一种情感的轻松过渡。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In a word, nature has bestow'd a kind of attraction on certain impressions and ideas, by which one of them, upon its appearance, naturally introduces its correlative. If these two attractions or associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object, they mutually assist each other, and the transition of the affections and of the imagination is made with the greatest ease and facility. When an idea produces an impression, related to an impression, which is connected with an idea, related to the first idea, these two impressions must be in a manner inseparable, nor will the one in any case be unattended with the other, 'Tis after this manner, that the particular causes of pride and humility are determin'd. The quality, which operates on the passion, produces separately an impression resembling it; the subject, to which the quality adheres, is related to self, the object of the passion: No wonder the whole cause, consisting of a quality and of a subject, does so unavoidably give rise to the passion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">总而言之，自然界对某些印象和想法赋予了一种吸引力，其中一个印象和想法一出现，就自然而然地引入了它的对应物。如果这两种印象和观念的吸引力或联系同时出现在同一个对象上，它们就会互相帮助，情感和想象力的转换就会变得非常容易和方便。当一个想法产生一个印象，与一个印象有关，而这个印象又与一个想法有关，与第一个想法有关，这两个印象在某种程度上必须是不可分割的，在任何情况下，一个印象也不会与另一个印象无关，"正是以这种方式，决定了骄傲和谦逊的特殊原因。对激情起作用的品质，单独产生一种与之相似的印象；品质所依附的主体，与激情的对象--自我有关。难怪由质量和主体组成的整个原因会如此不可避免地引起激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate this hypothesis, we may compare it to that, by which I have already explain'd the belief attending the judgments, which we form from causation. I have observ'd, that in all judgments of this kind, there is always a present impression, and a related idea; and that the present impression gives a vivacity to the fancy, and the relation conveys this vivacity, by an easy transition, to the related idea. Without the present impression, the attention is not fix'd, nor the spirits excited. Without the relation, this attention rests on its first object, and has no farther consequence. There is evidently a great analogy betwixt that hypothesis, and our present one of an impression and idea, that transfuse themselves into another impression and idea by means of their double relation: Which analogy must be allow'd to be no despicable proof of both hypotheses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了说明这个假设，我们可以把它与我已经解释过的、伴随着我们从因果关系中形成的判断的信念进行比较。我注意到，在所有这类判断中，总是有一个当前的印象和一个相关的想法；当前的印象给人以活力，而相关的想法则通过一个简单的过渡，将这种活力传递给相关的想法。没有现在的印象，人们的注意力就不会固定，精神也不会兴奋。如果没有关系，这种注意力就会停留在它的第一个目标上，而不会有更大的影响。显然，在这个假设和我们现在的假设之间有一个很大的类比，即一个印象和理念通过它们的双重关系而转化为另一个印象和理念。这种类比必须被允许成为两种假设的不卑不亢的证明。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I. Suppose an agreeable object to acquire a relation to self; the first passion, that appears on this occasion, is joy; and this passion discovers itself upon a slighter relation than pride and vain-glory. We may feel joy upon being present at a feast, where our senses are regal'd with delicacies of every kind: But 'tis only the master of the feast, who, beside the same joy, has the additional passion of self-applause and vanity. 'Tis true, men sometimes boast of a great entertainment, at which they have only been present; and by so small a relation convert their pleasure into pride: But however, this must in general be own'd, that joy arises from a more inconsiderable relation than vanity, and that many things, which are too foreign to produce pride, are yet . able to give us a delight and pleasure. The reason of the difference may be explain'd thus. A relation is requisite to joy, in order to approach the object to us, and make it give us any satisfaction. But beside this, which is common to both passions, ’tis requisite to pride, in order to produce a transition from one passion to another, and convert the satisfaction into vanity. As it has a double task to perform, it must be endow'd with double force and energy. To which we may add, that where agreeable objects bear not a very close relation to ourselves, they commonly do to some other person; and this latter relation not only excels, but even diminishes, and sometimes destroys the former, as we shall see afterwards<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-438" id="calibre_link-173" title="49">49</a></sup>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">I.假设一个令人满意的对象与自己发生了关系；在这种情况下出现的第一个激情是快乐；这种激情是在比骄傲和虚荣更轻微的关系上发现的。我们在参加宴会时可能会感到快乐，在宴会上我们的感官被各种美味佳肴所征服：但只有宴会的主人，在同样的快乐之外，还有自我赞美和虚荣的额外激情。诚然，人们有时会吹嘘自己只是参加了一次盛大的娱乐活动；并通过如此小的关系将他们的快乐转化为骄傲。但是，一般来说，我们必须承认，快乐来自于比虚荣更微不足道的关系，而且许多事情，虽然太过陌生，不能产生骄傲，但却能给我们带来快乐和愉悦。这种差异的原因可以这样解释。为了使对象接近我们，并使它给我们带来任何满足感，关系是快乐的必要条件。但除了这一点，也就是两种激情所共有的，骄傲也是必要的，以便从一种激情过渡到另一种激情，并将满足转化为虚荣。由于它有双重任务要完成，所以它必须被赋予双重力量和能量。对此，我们可以补充说，当令人满意的对象与我们自己没有非常密切的关系时，它们通常与其他一些人有关系；而这后一种关系不仅超越，而且甚至削弱，有时甚至破坏前者，正如我们随后将看到的那样<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-438" id="calibre_link-173" title="49">49</a></sup>.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here then is the first limitation, we must make to our general position, <i class="calibre10">that every thing related to us, which produces pleasure or pain, produces likewise pride or humility.</i> There is not only a relation requir'd, but a close one, and a closer than is requir'd to joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是我们必须对我们的一般立场作出的第一个限制，<i class="calibre10">即每一件与我们有关的事情，如果产生快乐或痛苦，同样也会产生骄傲或谦逊。</i>这不仅是一种必要的关系，而且是一种密切的关系，而且比快乐所需的更密切。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">II. The second limitation is, that the agreeable or disagreeable object be not only closely related, but also peculiar to ourselves, or at least common to us with a few persons. ’Tis a quality observable in human nature, and which we shall endeavour to explain afterwards, that everything, which is often presented, and to which we have been long accustom'd, loses its value in our eyes, and is in a little time despis'd and neglected. We likewise judge of objects more from comparison than from their real and intrinsic merit; and where we cannot by some contrast enhance their value, we are apt to overlook even what is essentially good in them. These qualities of the mind have an effect upon joy as well as pride; and 'tis remarkable, that goods, which are common to all mankind, and have become familiar to us by custom, give us little satisfaction; tho' perhaps of a more excellent kind, than those on which, for their singularity, we set a much higher value. But, tho' this circumstance operates on both these passions, it has a much greater influence on vanity. We are rejoic'd for many goods, which, on account of their frequency, give us no pride. Health, when it returns after a long absence, affords us a very sensible satisfaction; but is seldom regarded as a subject of vanity, because 'tis shar'd with such vast numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">II.第二个限制是，令人愉快或不愉快的对象不仅是密切相关的，而且是我们自己所特有的，或者至少是我们与少数人所共有的。这是在人性中可以观察到的一个特质，我们将在后面努力解释，即凡是经常出现的、我们已经习惯了的东西，在我们眼中都会失去价值，并在很短的时间内被轻视和忽略掉。同样，我们对物体的判断更多的是来自于比较，而不是它们真正的和内在的优点；如果我们不能通过一些对比来提高它们的价值，我们甚至很容易忽视它们本质上的优点。这些思想品质对快乐和骄傲都有影响；值得注意的是，全人类共有的、因习惯而变得熟悉的物品，给我们带来的满足感很小；尽管它们可能比那些因其特殊性而被我们赋予更高价值的物品更加优秀。但是，虽然这种情况对这两种激情都有影响，但它对虚荣心的影响更大。我们为许多商品感到高兴，但由于它们的频率，我们并不感到骄傲。健康，当它在长期缺席后回来时，会给我们带来非常明显的满足感；但很少被视为虚荣心的对象，因为它是与大量的人分享的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The reason, why pride is so much more delicate in this particular than joy, I take to be, as follows. In order to excite pride, there are always two objects we must contemplate, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the <i class="calibre10">cause</i> or that object which produces pleasure; and self, which is the real object of the passion. But joy has only one object necessary to its production, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that which gives pleasure; and tho' it be requisite, that this bear some relation to self; yet that is only requisite in order to render it agreeable; nor is self properly speaking, the object of this passion. Since, therefore, pride has in a manner two objects, to which it directs our view; it follows, that where neither of them have any singularity, the passion must be more weaken'd upon that account, than a passion, which has only one object. Upon comparing ourselves with others, as we are every moment apt to do, we find we are not in the least distinguish'd; and upon comparing the object we possess, we discover still the same unlucky circumstance. By two comparisons so disadvantageous the passion must be entirely destroy'd.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我认为，自豪感在这方面比快乐更微妙，原因如下。为了激发自豪感，我们必须考虑两个对象，<i class="calibre10">即</i>产生快乐的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>或对象；以及自我，这才是激情的真正对象。但快乐的产生只有一个必要的对象，<i class="calibre10">即</i>产生快乐的对象；虽然这个对象与自我有某种关系是必要的，但这只是为了使它令人愉快；正确地说，自我也不是这种激情的对象。因此，既然骄傲在某种程度上有两个对象，它把我们的视线引向这两个对象；那么，如果这两个对象都不具有任何独特性，那么这种激情就必须比只有一个对象的激情更弱。当我们将自己与他人进行比较时，就像我们每时每刻都在做的那样，我们发现自己丝毫不出众；而在比较我们所拥有的对象时，我们仍然发现同样的不幸情况。通过两个如此不利的比较，激情必须被完全摧毁。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">III. The third limitation is, that the pleasant or painful object be very discernible and obvious, and that not only to ourselves, but to others also. This circumstance, like the two foregoing, has an effect upon joy, as well as pride. We fancy ourselves more happy, as well as more virtuous or beautiful, when we appear so to others; but are still more ostentatious of our virtues than of our pleasures. This proceeds from causes, which I shall endeavour to explain afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">III.第三个限制是，愉快或痛苦的对象是非常明显的，而且不仅对我们自己，而且对其他人也是如此。这种情况与前述两种情况一样，对快乐和骄傲都有影响。当我们在别人面前显得更快乐时，我们会认为自己更快乐，也更有德行或美丽；但我们对自己的德行比对自己的快乐更加炫耀。这是由一些原因引起的，我将在后面努力解释。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">IV. The fourth limitation is deriv'd from the inconstancy of the cause of these passions, and from the short duration of connexion with ourselves. What is casual and inconstant but little joy, and less pride. We are not much satisfy'd with the thing itself; and are still less apt to feel any new degrees of self-satisfaction upon its account. We foresee and anticipate its change by the imagination; which makes us little satisfy'd with the thing: We compare it to ourselves, whose existence is more durable; by which means its inconstancy appears still greater. It seems ridiculous to infer an excellency in ourselves from an object, which is of so much shorter duration, and attends us during so small a part of our existence. 'Twill be easy to comprehend the reason, why this cause operates not with the same force in joy as in pride; since the idea of self is not so essential to the former passion as to the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">IV.第四种限制来自于这些激情的原因的不稳定性，以及与我们自己联系的短暂时间。偶然和不稳定的东西，却没有什么快乐，更没有什么自豪感。我们对事物本身并不满意；更不可能因为它而感到任何新程度的自我满足。我们通过想象来预见和预测它的变化；这使我们对该事物不太满意：我们把它与我们自己相比，我们的存在更持久；通过这种方式，它的不稳定性显得更大。从一个持续时间短得多、在我们存在的一小部分时间里陪伴我们的物体推断出我们自己的优点，这似乎很可笑。我们很容易理解为什么这个原因在快乐中的作用与在骄傲中的作用不一样；因为自我的概念对前者的激情来说并不像后者那样重要。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">V. I may add as a fifth limitation, or rather enlargement of this system, that <i class="calibre10">general rules</i> have a great influence upon pride and humility, as well as on all the other passions. Hence we form a notion of different ranks of men, suitable to the power or riches they are possest of; and this notion we change not upon account of any peculiarities of the health or temper of the persons, which may deprive them of all enjoyment in their possessions. This may be accounted for from the same principles, that explain'd the influence of general rules on the understanding. Custom readily carries us beyond the just bounds in our passions, as well as in our reasonings.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">V.我可以补充说，作为这个系统的第五个限制，或者说是扩大，<i class="calibre10">一般的规则</i>对骄傲和谦逊以及所有其他的激情都有很大的影响。因此，我们形成了一种人的不同等级的概念，与他们所拥有的权力或财富相适应；这种概念的改变不是因为人的健康或脾气的任何特殊性，这可能会使他们失去对其财产的所有享受。这可以从解释一般规则对理解力的影响的相同原则中得到解释。习俗很容易使我们在激情和推理方面超越公正的界限。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be amiss to observe on this occasion, that the influence of general rules and maxims on the passions very much contributes to facilitate the effects of all the principles, which we shall explain in the progress of this treatise. For ’tis evident, that if a person full-grown, and of the same nature with ourselves, were on a sudden transported into our world, he wou'd be very much embarrass'd with every object, and wou'd not readily find what degree of love or hatred, pride or humility, or any other passion he ought to attribute to it. The passions are often vary'd by very inconsiderable principles; and these do not always play with a perfect regularity, especially on the first trial. But as custom and practice have brought to light all these principles, and have settled the just value of every thing; this must certainly contribute to the easy production of the passions, and guide us, by means of general establish'd maxims, in the proportions we ought to observe in preferring one object to another. This remark may, perhaps, serve to obviate difficulties, that may arise concerning some causes, which I shall hereafter ascribe to particular passions, and which may be esteem'd too refin'd to operate so universally and certainly, as they are found to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这种情况下，我们不妨指出，一般规则和格言对激情的影响非常有助于促进所有原则的效果，我们将在本论文的进展中解释这些原则。因为很明显，如果一个成年的、与我们性质相同的人突然被带到我们的世界，他会对每一个对象感到非常尴尬，而且不容易找到他应该把爱或恨、骄傲或谦卑或任何其他激情归于哪种程度。激情往往是由非常微不足道的原则所决定的；这些原则并不总是以完美的规律性发挥作用，尤其是在第一次试验中。但是，由于习惯和实践已经揭示了所有这些原则，并确定了每件事情的公正价值；这肯定有助于轻松地产生激情，并通过一般既定的格言来指导我们在喜欢一个对象时应该遵守的比例。这句话也许有助于消除可能出现的困难，因为我将在下文中把某些原因归结为特定的激情，而这些原因可能被认为过于精巧，无法像它们被发现的那样普遍而肯定地发挥作用。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall close this subject with a reflection deriv'd from these five limitations. This reflection is, that the persons, who are proudest, and who in the eye of the world have most reason for their pride, are not always the happiest; nor the most humble always the most miserable, as may at first sight be imagin'd from this system. An evil may be real, tho' its cause has no relation to us: It may be real, without being peculiar: It may be real, without shewing itself to others: It may be real, without being constant: And it may be real, without falling under the general rules. Such evils as these will not fail to render us miserable, tho' they have little tendency to diminish pride: And perhaps the most real and the most solid evils of life will be found of this nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将用从这五个限制中得出的思考来结束这个话题。这个反思是，那些最骄傲的人，以及在世人眼里最有理由骄傲的人，并不总是最幸福的；最卑微的人也不总是最悲惨的，就像从这个系统中乍看之下所想象的那样。邪恶可能是真实的，尽管其原因与我们没有关系。它可能是真实的，但并不特别：它可能是真实的，但并不向他人展示自己。它可能是真实的，而不是恒定的：它也可能是真实的，而不属于一般的规则。诸如此类的罪恶不会不使我们感到痛苦，尽管它们几乎没有减少骄傲的趋势。也许生活中最真实、最牢固的邪恶都是这种性质的。</p></div>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with vice and virtue, which are the most obvious causes of these passions; 'twou'd be entirely foreign to my present purpose to enter upon the controversy, which of late years has so much excited the curiosity of the publick, <i class="calibre10">whether these moral distinctions be founded on natural and original principles, or arise from interest and education.</i> The examination of this I reserve for the following book; and in the mean time shall endeavour to show, that my system maintains its ground upon either of these hypotheses; which will be a strong proof of its solidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先说说恶习和美德，这是产生这些激情的最明显的原因；我现在的目的完全不是为了讨论这个问题，近年来这个问题引起了公众的好奇心，即<i class="calibre10">这些道德上的区别是建立在自然和原始的原则之上，还是源于兴趣和教育。</i>对这个问题的研究，我保留在下一本书中进行；同时，我将努力表明，我的体系在这两种假设中的任何一种都能保持其基础；这将是对其稳固性的有力证明。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">For granting that morality had no foundation in nature, it must still be allow'd, that vice and virtue, either from self interest or the prejudices of education, produce in us a real pain and pleasure; and this we may observe to be strenuously asserted by the defenders of that hypothesis. Every passion, habit, or turn of character (say they) which has a tendency to our advantage or prejudice, gives a delight or uneasiness; and 'tis from thence the approbation or disapprobation arises. We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack: justice is the support of society, but injustice, unless check'd, wou'd quickly prove its ruin: Humility exalts; but pride mortifies us. For these reasons the former qualities are esteem'd virtues, and the latter regarded as vices. Now since 'tis granted there is a delight or uneasiness still attending merit or demerit of every kind, this is all that is requisite for my purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">即使道德在自然界中没有基础，也必须承认，恶习和美德，无论是出于自身利益还是教育的偏见，都会在我们身上产生真正的痛苦和快乐；我们可以看到，这一假设的辩护者极力主张这一点。他们说，每一种激情、习惯或性格的转变，只要对我们有利或有偏见，都会给人带来快乐或不安；赞许或不赞许就是从这里产生的。我们很容易从别人的慷慨中得到好处，但总是有可能因他们的贪婪而失去。勇气能保护我们，但懦弱会使我们受到各种攻击：正义是社会的支撑，但不公正，除非受到制止，否则很快就会证明它的毁灭：谦逊能使我们高尚，但骄傲会使我们堕落。由于这些原因，前者被视为美德，而后者被视为恶习。既然每一种优点或缺点都会带来快乐或不安，这就是我的目的所需要的全部内容。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But I go farther, and observe, that this moral hypothesis and my present system not only agree together, but also that, allowing the former to be just, 'tis an absolute and invincible proof of the latter. For if all morality be founded on the pain or pleasure, which arises from the prospect of any loss or advantage, that may result from our own characters, or from those of others, all the effects of morality must be deriv'd from the same pain or pleasure, and among the rest, the passions of pride and humility. The very essence of virtue, according to this hypothesis, is to produce pleasure, and that of vice to give pain. The virtue and vice must be part of our character in order to excite pride or humility. What farther proof can we desire for the double relation of impressions and ideas?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但我更进一步指出，这个道德假设和我目前的体系不仅一致，而且，如果允许前者是公正的，它就是后者的绝对和不可战胜的证明。因为如果所有的道德都建立在痛苦或快乐之上，而这种痛苦或快乐是由我们自己的性格或他人的性格可能导致的任何损失或利益的前景引起的，那么道德的所有效果都必须来自同样的痛苦或快乐，在其余的痛苦或快乐中，还有骄傲和谦逊的激情。根据这一假设，美德的本质是产生快乐，而恶习的本质则是带来痛苦。美德和恶习必须是我们性格的一部分，才能激起骄傲或谦卑。对于印象和观念的双重关系，我们还想得到什么进一步的证明呢？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The same unquestionable argument may be deriv'd from the opinion of those, who maintain that morality is something real, essential, and founded on nature. The most probable hypothesis, which has been advanc'd to explain the distinction betwixt vice and virtue, and the origin of moral rights and obligations, is, that from a primary constitution of nature certain characters and passions, by the very view and contemplation, produce a pain, and others in like manner excite a pleasure. The uneasiness and satisfaction are not only inseparable from vice and virtue, but constitute their very nature and essence. To approve of a character is to feel an original delight upon its appearance. To disapprove of it is to be sensible of an uneasiness. The pain and pleasure, therefore, being the primary causes of vice and virtue, must also be the causes of all their effects, and consequently of pride and humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of that distinction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">同样不容置疑的论点也可以从那些认为道德是真实的、基本的、建立在自然之上的观点中得到。为了解释罪恶和美德之间的区别以及道德权利和义务的起源，人们提出的最有可能的假设是，从自然界的一个基本结构来看，某些性格和激情，通过观察和思考，产生了一种痛苦，而另一些则以同样的方式激发了一种快乐。这种不安和满足不仅与恶习和美德密不可分，而且构成了它们的性质和本质。赞同一种品德，就是对它的外表感到一种原始的喜悦。不赞成它，就是感觉到了一种不安。因此，痛苦和快乐是罪恶和美德的主要原因，也必须是它们所有影响的原因，因此也是骄傲和谦逊的原因，而这是这种区别不可避免的伴随。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But supposing this hypothesis of moral philosophy shou'd be allow'd to be false, 'tis still evident, that pain and pleasure, if not the causes of vice and virtue, are at least inseparable from them. A generous and noble character affords a satisfaction even in the survey; and when presented to us, tho only in a poem or fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the other hand cruelty and treachery displease from their very nature; nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to these qualities, either in ourselves or others. Thus one hypothesis of morality is an undeniable proof of the foregoing system, and the other at worst agrees with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，假设道德哲学的这一假设被认为是错误的，那么仍然很明显，痛苦和快乐，如果不是罪恶和美德的原因，至少也是与它们不可分割的。慷慨和高尚的性格甚至在调查中也能带来满足感；当呈现在我们面前时，尽管只是在诗歌或寓言中，也永远不会让我们感到迷惑和愉悦。另一方面，残忍和背信弃义从本质上就令人不快；无论是我们自己还是他人，都不可能使我们对这些品质感到满意。因此，道德的一个假设是上述系统的一个不可否认的证明，而另一个假设在最坏的情况下也与之一致。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But pride and humility arise not from these qualities alone of the mind, which, according to the vulgar systems of ethicks, have been comprehended as parts of moral duty, but from any other that has a connexion with pleasure and uneasiness. Nothing flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleasing by our wit, good humour, or any other accomplishment; and nothing gives us a more sensible mortification than a disappointment in any attempt of that nature. No one has ever been able to tell what <i class="calibre10">wit</i> is, and to shew why such a system of thought must be receiv'd under that denomination, and such another rejected. 'Tis only by taste we can decide concerning it, nor are we possest of any other standard, upon which we can form a judgment of this kind. Now what is this taste, from which true and false wit in a manner receive their being, and without which no thought can have a title to either of these denominations? 'Tis plainly nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true wit, and of uneasiness from false, without our being able to tell the reasons of that pleasure or uneasiness. The power of bestowing these opposite sensations is, therefore, the very essence of true and false wit; and consequently the cause of that pride or humility, which arises from them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，骄傲和谦卑并不单单来自这些心灵的品质，根据庸俗的伦理学体系，这些品质被视为道德责任的一部分，而是来自与快乐和不安有关的任何其他品质。没有什么比用我们的智慧、幽默或任何其他成就来取悦他人的才能更能满足我们的虚荣心；也没有什么比在这种性质的任何尝试中感到失望更能让我们感到羞愧。从来没有人能够告诉我们什么是<i class="calibre10">机智</i>，也没有人能够说明为什么这样的思想体系必须在这个名称下被接受，而这样的思想体系则被拒绝。我们只能通过品味来决定它，我们也没有任何其他的标准，我们可以据此形成这种判断。那么，这种品味是什么呢？在某种程度上，真正的和虚假的智慧都来自于这种品味，而没有这种品味，任何思想都不可能有资格获得这些教派中的任何一个。很明显，它只不过是一种来自真智慧的快乐和来自假智慧的不安的感觉，而我们无法说出这种快乐或不安的原因。因此，赋予这些相反的感觉的能力是真正的和虚假的智慧的本质；因此，也是由它们产生的骄傲或谦卑的原因。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">There may, perhaps, be some, who being accustom'd to the style of the schools and pulpit, and having never consider'd human nature in any other light, than that in which <i class="calibre10">they</i> place it, may here be surpriz'd to hear me talk of virtue as exciting pride, which they look upon as a vice; and of vice as producing humility, which they have been taught to consider as a virtue. But not to dispute about words, I observe, that by <i class="calibre10">pride</i> I understand that agreeable impression, which arises in the mind, when the view either of our virtue, beauty, riches or power makes us satisfy'd with ourselves: And that by <i class="calibre10">humility</i> I mean the opposite impression. 'Tis evident the former impression is not always vicious, nor the latter virtuous. The most rigid morality allows us to receive a pleasure from reflecting on a generous action; and 'tis by none esteem`d a virtue to feel any fruitless remorses upon the thoughts of past villiany and baseness. Let us, therefore, examine these impressions, consider'd in themselves; and enquire into their causes, whether plac'd on the mind or body, without troubling ourselves at present with that merit or blame, which may attend them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">也许有些人习惯于学校和讲坛的风格，从来没有从其他方面考虑过人性，而不是<i class="calibre10">他们</i>所认为的那样，在这里听到我说美德会激起骄傲，他们认为这是一种恶习；而恶习会产生谦卑，他们被教导为一种美德，可能会感到惊讶。但我不想在文字上争论，我认为，我所说的<i class="calibre10">骄傲</i>是指当看到我们的美德、美貌、财富或权力使我们对自己感到满意时，在心中产生的那种愉快的印象。我所说的<i class="calibre10">谦卑</i>是指相反的印象。显然，前一种印象并不总是邪恶的，后一种印象也不总是美德的。最严格的道德允许我们从对慷慨行为的反思中获得快乐；没有人认为对过去的卑鄙和无耻的想法感到任何无果的悔恨是一种美德。因此，让我们审视这些印象本身，并探究它们的原因，无论它们是加在心灵还是身体上的，而不必在此刻为它们可能带来的功绩或责备而烦恼。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 cn">无论我们是把身体看作是我们自己的一部分，还是同意那些把它看作是外部事物的哲学家的观点，都必须允许它与我们有足够近的联系，以形成这种双重关系中的一种，我已经断言，这种关系是导致骄傲和谦逊的必要原因。因此，只要我们能找到另一种印象的关系与观念的关系相结合，我们就可以根据印象的愉快或不愉快，有把握地期待这些激情的出现。但是，各种<i class="calibre10">美都会</i>给我们带来特殊的快乐和满足；而<i class="calibre10">畸形</i>则会产生痛苦，不管它是放在什么地方，也不管它是放在有生命还是无生命的物体上。因此，如果美丽或畸形被放在我们自己的身体上，这种快乐或不安必须转化为骄傲或谦卑，因为在这种情况下，有所有必要的情况来产生印象和想法的完美过渡。这些相反的感觉是与相反的激情相关的。美丽或畸形与自我密切相关，是这两种激情的对象。难怪，我们自己的美貌成为骄傲的对象，而畸形成为谦卑的对象。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But this effect of personal and bodily qualities is not only a proof of the present system, by showing that the passions arise not in this case without all the circumstances I have requir'd, but may be empley'd as a stronger and more convincing argument. If we consider all the hypotheses, which have been form'd either by philosophy or common reason, to explain the difference betwixt beauty and deformity, we shall find that all of them resolve into this, that beauty is such an order and construction of parts, as either by the <i class="calibre10">primary constitution</i> of our nature, by <i class="calibre10">custom</i>, or by <i class="calibre10">caprice</i>, is fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul. This is the distinguishing character of beauty, and forms all the difference betwixt it and deformity, whose natural tendency is to produce uneasiness. Pleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary attendants of beauty and deformity, but constitute their very essence. And indeed, if we consider, that a great part of the beauty, which we admire either in animals or in other objects, is deriv'd from the idea of convenience and utility, we shall make no scruple to assent to this opinion. That shape, which produces strength, is beautiful in one animal; and that which is a sign of agility in another. The order and convenience of a palace are no less essential to its beauty, than its mere figure and appearance. In like manner the rules of architecture require, that the top of a pillar shou'd be more slender than its base, and that because such a figure conveys to us the idea of security, which is pleasant; whereas the contrary form gives us the apprehension of danger, which is uneasy. From innumerable instances of this kind, as well as from considering that beauty like wit, cannot be defin'd, but is discern'd only by a taste or sensation, we may conclude, that beauty is nothing but a form, which produces pleasure, as deformity is a structure of parts, which conveys pain; and since the power of producing pain and pleasure make in this manner the essence of beauty and deformity, all the effects of these qualities must be deriv'd from the sensation; and among the rest pride and humility, which of all their effects are the most common and remarkable.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，这种个人和身体素质的影响不仅是对现有体系的证明，因为它表明在这种情况下，如果没有我所要求的所有情况，激情是不会产生的，而且还可以作为一个更强大和更有说服力的论据。如果我们考虑所有由哲学或普通理性提出的假设，来解释美和畸形之间的区别，我们会发现，所有这些假设都是这样的：美是这样一种部分的秩序和结构，无论是由我们本性的<i class="calibre10">主要构成</i>，还是由<i class="calibre10">习俗</i>，或由<i class="calibre10">任性</i>，都适合给灵魂带来快乐和满足。这就是美的特征，也是它与畸形的全部区别，后者的自然倾向是产生不安。因此，快乐和痛苦不仅是美和畸形的必要伴随者，而且构成了它们的本质。事实上，如果我们考虑到，我们在动物或其他物体上所欣赏的美，有很大一部分是来自于方便和实用的理念，我们就会毫不犹豫地同意这个观点。在一种动物身上，能产生力量的形状是美丽的；而在另一种动物身上，则是敏捷的标志。一座宫殿的秩序和便利对其美感的重要性不亚于其单纯的身材和外观。同样，建筑学的规则要求，柱子的顶端应该比它的底部更细长，这是因为这样的形状向我们传达了安全的概念，这是令人愉快的；而相反的形式给我们带来危险的担忧，这是令人不安的。从这种无数的例子中，以及考虑到美和智慧一样，不能被定义，而只能通过品味或感觉来辨别，我们可以得出结论，美只不过是一种形式，它产生快乐，就像畸形是一种部件的结构，它传达痛苦。既然产生痛苦和快乐的能力以这种方式成为美和畸形的本质，那么这些品质的所有效果都必须从感觉中推导出来；在其余的效果中，骄傲和谦逊是最常见和最显著的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This argument I esteem just and decisive; but in order to give greater authority to the present reasoning, let us suppose it false for a moment, and see what will follow. ’Tis certain, then, that if the power of producing pleasure and pain forms not the essence of beauty and deformity, the sensations are at least inseparable from the qualities, and 'tis even difficult to consider them apart. Now there is nothing common to natural and moral beauty, (both of which are the causes of pride) but this power of producing pleasure; and as a common effect supposes always a common cause, 'tis plain the pleasure must in both cases be the real and influencing cause of the passion. Again; there is nothing originally different betwixt the beauty of our bodies and the beauty of external and foreign objects, but that the one has a near relation to ourselves, which is wanting in the other. This original difference, therefore, must be the cause of all their other differences, and among the rest, of their different influence upon the passion of pride, which is excited by the beauty of our person, but is not affected in the least by that of foreign and external objects. Placing, then, these two conclusions together, we find they compose the preceding system betwixt them, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that pleasure, as a related or resembling impression, when plac'd on a related object, by a natural transition, produces pride; and its contrary, humility. This system, then, seems already sufficiently confirm'd by experience; tho' we have not yet exhausted all our arguments. ’Tis not the beauty of the body alone that produces pride, but also its strength and force. Strength is a kind of power; and therefore the desire to excel in strength is to be consider'd as an inferior species of <i class="calibre10">ambition</i>. For this reason the present phenomenon will be sufficiently accounted for, in explaining that passion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这个论点我认为是公正的和决定性的；但为了给目前的推理以更大的权威，让我们暂时假设它是错误的，看看接下来会发生什么。那么，可以肯定的是，如果产生快乐和痛苦的能力不构成美和畸形的本质，那么感觉至少与品质是不可分割的，甚至很难将它们分开考虑。现在，自然美和道德美（两者都是骄傲的原因）没有任何共同之处，只有这种产生快乐的能力；由于共同的效果总是假定有一个共同的原因，很明显，在这两种情况下，快乐必须是激情的真正和影响的原因。再有，我们身体的美与外部和外来物体的美之间本来就没有什么不同，只是一个与我们自己有密切的关系，而另一个却没有。因此，这种原始的差异必须是它们所有其他差异的原因，其中包括它们对骄傲的激情的不同影响，而骄傲的激情是由我们身体的美所激发的，但丝毫不受外国和外部物体的影响。那么，把这两个结论放在一起，我们发现它们构成了前面的系统，<i class="calibre10">即</i>快乐，作为一种相关或相似的印象，当放在一个相关的对象上时，通过自然过渡，产生骄傲；而与之相反，产生谦逊。那么，这个系统似乎已经被经验充分证实了；尽管我们还没有穷尽所有的论据。产生骄傲的不仅仅是身体的美貌，还有它的力量和势力。力量是权力的一种；因此，在力量方面出类拔萃的愿望应被认为是一种低级的<i class="calibre10">野心</i>。由于这个原因，在解释这种激情时，目前的现象就可以得到充分的解释。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Tho' it shou'd be question'd, whether beauty be not something real, and different from the power of producing pleasure, it can never be disputed, that as surprize is nothing but a pleasure arising from novelty, it is not, properly speaking, a quality in any object, but merely a passion or impression in the soul. It must, therefore, be from that impression, that pride by a natural transition arises. And it arises so naturally, that there is nothing <i class="calibre10">in us or belonging to us</i>, which produces surprize, that does not at the same time excite that other passion. Thus we are vain of the surprising adventures we have met with, the escapes we have made, and dangers we have been expos'd to. Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men without any interest, and merely out of vanity, heap up a number of extraordinary events, which are either the fictions of their brain, or if true, have at least no connexion with themselves.

By one of these experiments we find, that an object produces pride merely by the interposition of pleasure; and that because the quality, by which it produces pride, is in reality nothing but the power of producing pleasure. By the other experiment we find, that the pleasure produces the pride by a transition along related ideas; because when we cut off that relation the passion is immediately destroy'd. A surprising adventure, in which we have been ourselves engag'd, is related to us, and by that means produces pride: But the adventures of others, tho' they may cause pleasure, yet for want of this relation of ideas, never excite that passion.

		<p class="block_6 en">There is only one objection to this system with regard to our body; which is, that tho' nothing be more agreeable than health, and more painful than sickness, yet commonly men are neither proud of the one, nor mortify'd with the other. This will easily be accounted for, if we consider the <i class="calibre10">second</i> and <i class="calibre10">fourth</i> limitations, propos'd to our general system. It was observ'd, that no object ever produces pride or humility, if it has not something <i class="calibre10">peculiar</i> to ourself; as also, that every cause of that passion must be in some measure constant, and hold some proportion to the duration of ourself, which is its object. Now as health and sickness vary incessantly to all men, and there is none, who is <i class="calibre10">solely</i> or <i class="calibre10">certainly</i> fix'd in either, these accidental blessings and calamities are in a manner separated from us, and are never consider'd as connected with our being and existence. And that this account is just appears hence, that wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our constitution, that we no longer entertain any hopes of recovery, from that moment it becomes an object of humility; as is evident in old men, whom nothing mortifies more than the consideration of their age and infirmities. They endeavour, as long as possible, to conceal their blindness and deafness, their rheums and gouts; nor do they ever confess them without reluctance and uneasiness. And tho' young men are not asham'd of every head-ach or cold they fall into, yet no topic is so proper to mortify human pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of our nature, than this, that we are every moment of our lives subject to such infirmities. This sufficiently proves that bodily pain and sickness are in themselves proper causes of humility; tho' the custom of estimating every thing by comparison more than by its intrinsic worth and value, makes us overlook these calamities, which we find to be incident to every one, and causes us to form an idea of our merit and character independent of them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对于我们的身体，这个系统只有一个反对意见；那就是，尽管没有什么比健康更令人高兴，比疾病更令人痛苦，但人们通常既不为健康感到骄傲，也不为疾病感到痛苦。如果我们考虑一下对我们的一般系统提出的<i class="calibre10">第二</i>和<i class="calibre10">第四个</i>限制，这就很容易解释了。我们注意到，任何物体如果没有我们自己<i class="calibre10">特有</i>的东西，就不会产生骄傲或谦卑；同样，导致这种激情的每一个原因都必须在某种程度上是恒定的，并与作为其对象的我们自己的持续时间保持某种比例。现在，由于健康和疾病对所有的人来说都是不断变化的，而且没有一个人是<i class="calibre10">完全</i>或<i class="calibre10">肯定地</i>固定在其中的，这些偶然的祝福和灾难在某种程度上是与我们分离的，而且从未被认为是与我们的存在和存在有关。这种说法是正确的，因为无论哪种疾病在我们的身体里扎根，以至于我们不再有任何康复的希望，从那一刻起，它就成了谦卑的对象；这一点在老人身上很明显，没有什么比考虑他们的年龄和体弱多病更让他们感到沮丧。他们尽可能地掩盖他们的失明和失聪，他们的风湿和痛风；他们也不会在不情愿和不安的情况下承认它们。尽管年轻人并不为他们的每一次头疼或感冒感到羞愧，但没有什么话题比这更能挫伤人的自尊心，使我们对自己的本性产生一种卑劣的看法，那就是我们一生中每时每刻都会受到这种疾病的影响。这足以证明身体的疼痛和疾病本身就是谦卑的适当原因；虽然通过比较而不是通过其内在价值和价值来评估每件事情的习惯，使我们忽视了这些灾难，我们发现这些灾难是每个人都会遇到的，并使我们对自己的功绩和性格形成一种独立于它们的想法。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body, that is <i class="calibre10">self</i> for their natural and more immediate causes, we find by experience, that there are many other objects, which produce these affections, and that the primary one is, in some measure, obscur'd and lost by the multiplicity of foreign and extrinsic. We found a vanity upon houses, gardens, equipages, as well as upon personal merit and accomplishments; and tho' these external advantages be in themselves widely distant from thought or a person, yet they considerably influence even a passion, which is directed to that as its ultimate object. This happens when external objects acquire any particular relation to ourselves, and are associated or connected with us. A beautiful fish in the ocean, an animal in a desart, and indeed any thing that neither belongs, nor is related to us, has no manner of influence on our vanity, whatever extraordinary qualities it may be endow'd with, and whatever degree of surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion. It must be some way associated with us in order to touch our pride. Its idea must hang in a manner, upon that of ourselves; and the transition from the one to the other must be easy and natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管骄傲和谦卑具有<i class="calibre10">我们</i>的身心素质，也就是它们的自然和更直接的原因，但我们根据经验发现，还有许多其他对象产生这些情感，而且主要的情感在某种程度上被外来和外在的多重因素所掩盖和丧失。我们发现人们对房屋、花园、设备以及个人的功绩和成就有一种虚荣心；尽管这些外在的好处本身与思想或人有很大的距离，但它们甚至大大影响了一种激情，而这种激情是以它的最终目标为导向的。当外部物体获得了与我们的任何特定关系，并与我们联系在一起时，就会发生这种情况。海洋中的一条美丽的鱼，沙漠中的一只动物，以及实际上任何既不属于我们，也不与我们有关的东西，都不会对我们的虚荣心产生任何影响，不管它被赋予什么样的非凡品质，也不管它可能自然地引起什么样的惊奇和赞美。它必须与我们有某种联系，才能触动我们的自尊心。它的想法必须以某种方式挂在我们自己的想法上；而且从一个到另一个的过渡必须是容易和自然的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But here 'tis remarkable, that tho' the relation of <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i> operates upon the mind in the same manner as contiguity and causation, in conveying us from one idea to another, yet 'tis seldom a foundation either of pride or of humility. If we resemble a person in any of the valuable parts of his character, we must, in some degree, possess the quality, in which we resemble him; and this quality we always chuse to survey directly in ourselves rather than by redexion in another person, when we wou'd found upon it any degree of vanity. So that tho' a likeness may occasionally produce that passion by suggesting a more advantageous idea of ourselves, 'tis there the view fixes at last, and the passion finds its ultimate and final cause.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但这里值得注意的是，尽管<i class="calibre10">相似</i>的关系在头脑中的运作方式与毗连性和因果关系相同，将我们从一个概念传递到另一个概念，但它很少成为骄傲或谦逊的基础。如果我们在一个人的性格中的任何有价值的部分与他相似，我们就必须在某种程度上拥有我们与他相似的品质；而这种品质我们总是选择在自己身上直接观察，而不是通过在另一个人身上重现，当我们发现有任何程度的虚荣。因此，尽管相似性可能偶尔会通过暗示对我们自己更有利的想法而产生这种激情，但观点最终定格在那里，这种激情也就找到了它的最终和最终原因。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">There are instances, indeed, wherein men shew a vanity in resembling a great man in his countenance, shape, air, or other minute circumstances, that contribute not in any degree to his reputation; but it must be confess'd, that this extends not very far, nor is of any considerable moment in these affections. For this I assign the following reason. We can never have a vanity of resembling in triffles any person, unless he be possess'd of very shining qualities, which give us a respect and veneration for him. These qualities, then, are, properly speaking, the causes of our vanity, by means of their relation to ourselves. Now after what manner are they related to ourselves? They are parts of the person we value, and consequently connected with these triffles; which are also suppos'd to be parts of him. These triffles are connected with the resembling qualities in us; and these qualities in us, being parts, are connected with the whole; and by that means form a chain of several links betwixt ourselves and the shining qualities of the person we resemble. But besides that this multitude of relations must weaken the connexion; ’tis evident the mind, in passing from the shining qualities to the trivial ones, must by that contrast the better perceive the minuteness of the latter, and be in some measure asham'd of the comparison and resemblance.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">确实有这样的例子，人们表现出一种虚荣心，在他的面容、形状、气质或其他细微的情况下与一个伟人相似，而这些情况在任何程度上都无助于他的声誉；但必须承认，这种情况延伸得不是很远，在这些情感中也没有任何相当的重要性。为此，我给出了以下理由。我们永远不会有虚荣心，认为自己与任何一个人相似，除非他拥有非常耀眼的品质，使我们对他产生尊敬和崇拜。那么，正确地说，这些品质是我们虚荣心的原因，因为它们与我们自己有关。那么，它们与我们的关系是怎样的呢？它们是我们所珍视的人的一部分，因此与这些三要素有关；这些三要素也被认为是他的一部分。这些三要素与我们身上相似的品质相联系；而我们身上的这些品质，作为部分，与整体相联系；通过这种方式，在我们自己和我们相似的人的光辉品质之间形成了一个由若干环节组成的链条。但除此之外，这种众多的关系一定会削弱这种联系；很明显，在从闪亮的品质转到琐碎的品质时，心灵必须通过这种对比更好地感知后者的微小，并在某种程度上对这种比较和相似感到羞愧。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The relation, therefore, of contiguity, or that of causation, betwixt the cause and object of pride and humility, is alone requisite to give rise to these passions; and these relations are nothing else but qualities, by which the imagination is convey'd from one idea to another. Now let us consider what effect these can possibly have upon the mind, and by what means they become so requisite to the production of the passions. 'Tis evident, that the association of ideas operates in so silent and imperceptible a manner, that we are scarce sensible of it, and discover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or perception. It produces no emotion, and gives rise to no new impression of any kind, but only modifies those ideas, of which the mind was formerly possess'd, and which it cou'd recal upon occasion. From this reasoning, as well as from undoubted experience, we may conclude, that an association of ideas, however necessary, is not alone sufficient to give rise to any passion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在骄傲和谦卑的原因和对象之间，只有毗连的关系，或因果的关系，才是产生这些激情的必要条件；而这些关系无非是品质，通过这些品质，想象力从一个概念传递到另一个概念。现在让我们考虑一下，这些东西可能对心灵产生什么影响，以及它们是通过什么方式成为产生激情的必要条件的。很明显，观念的联想是以一种无声无息、不易察觉的方式进行的，我们几乎感觉不到它的存在，更多的是通过其效果而不是通过任何直接的感觉或知觉来发现它。它不产生任何情感，也不产生任何新的印象，而只是修改了那些思想，这些思想以前是拥有的，而且它在某些情况下会回忆起来。从这个推理以及毋庸置疑的经验中，我们可以得出这样的结论：观念的关联，无论多么必要，都不足以引起任何激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, then, that when the mind feels the passion either of pride or humility upon the appearance of a related object, there is, beside the relation or transition of thought, an emotion or original impression produc'd by some other principle. The question is, whether the emotion first produc'd be the passion itself, or some other impression related to it. This question we cannot be long in deciding. For besides all the other arguments, with which this subject abounds, it must evidently appear, that the relation of ideas, which experience shews to be so requisite a circumstance to the production of the passion, wou'd be entirely superfluous, were it not to second a relation of affections, and facilitate the transition from one impression to another. If nature produc'd immediately the passion of pride or humility, it wou'd be compleated in itself, and wou'd require no farther addition or encrease from any other affection. But supposing the first emotion to be only related to pride or humility, 'tis easily conceiv'd to what purpose the relation of objects may serve, and how the two different associations, of impressions and ideas, by uniting their forces, may assist each other's operation. This is not only easily conceiv'd, but I will venture to affirm 'tis the only manner, in which we can conceive this subject. An easy transition of ideas, which, of itself; causes no emotion, can never be necessary, or even useful to the passions, but by forwarding the transition betwixt some related impressions. Not to mention, that the same object causes a greater or smaller degree of pride, not only in proportion to the encrease or decrease of its qualities, but also to the distance or nearness of the relation; which is a clear argument for the transition of affections along the relation of ideas; since every change in the relation produces a proportion able change in the passion. Thus one part of the preceding system, concerning the relations of ideas is a sufficient proof of the other, concerning that of impressions; and is itself so evidently founded on experience, that 'twou'd be lost time to endeavour farther to prove it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，显而易见的是，当心灵因相关对象的出现而感到骄傲或谦卑的激情时，除了思想的关系或过渡外，还有一种由其他原则产生的情绪或原始印象。问题是，首先产生的情感是激情本身，还是与之相关的其他印象。这个问题我们不能久拖不决。因为除了这个问题所包含的所有其他论据之外，显然必须看到，经验表明，思想的关系是产生激情的必要条件，如果不是为了配合情感的关系，促进从一种印象到另一种印象的过渡，那就完全是多余的了。如果自然界立即产生了骄傲或谦卑的激情，那么它本身就已经完成了，不需要再从任何其他情感中添加或增加了。但是，假设第一种情感只与骄傲或谦卑有关，就很容易想象出对象的关系可以起到什么作用，以及印象和观念这两种不同的关联如何通过联合它们的力量来帮助彼此的运作。这不仅是很容易想象的，而且我敢肯定，这是我们能够想象这个主题的唯一方式。观念的轻松转换，本身并不引起任何情绪，对激情来说永远是必要的，甚至是有用的，但要通过推进一些相关印象之间的转换。更不用说，同一个物体引起的骄傲程度或大或小，不仅与它的质量的增加或减少成比例，而且与关系的远近成比例；这是对情感沿着观念的关系过渡的一个明确的论证；因为关系的每一个变化都会在激情中产生一个比例的变化。因此，前面系统的一部分，关于观念的关系，充分证明了另一部分，关于印象的关系；而且它本身是如此明显地建立在经验之上，以至于再努力去证明它就会失去时间。</p></div>

He first considers these objects; is affected by them in an agreeable manner; and then returning back to himself, thro' the relation of parent and child, is elevated with the passion of pride, by means of the double relation of impressions and ideas. Since therefore the passion depends on these relations, whatever strengthens any of the relations must also encrease the passion, and whatever weakens the relations must diminish the passion. Now 'tis certain the identity of the possession strengthens the relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred, and conveys the fancy with greater facility from one generation to another, from the remotest ancestors to their posterity, who are both their heirs and their descendants. By this facility the impression is transmitted more entire, and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，当任何一个人吹嘘他的家族的古老时，他的虚荣心的主题不仅仅是时间的长度和祖先的数量，还有他们的财富和信用，这些都被认为是由于他与他们的关系而在他身上反映出一种光泽。他首先考虑这些对象；以一种愉快的方式受到它们的影响；然后回到自己身上，通过父母和子女的关系，通过印象和观念的双重关系，以骄傲的激情得到提升。因此，既然激情取决于这些关系，那么，凡是加强任何一种关系的都必须增加激情，凡是削弱这些关系的都必须减少激情。现在可以肯定的是，财产的同一性加强了因血缘和亲缘关系而产生的观念的关系，并以更大的便利从一代传到另一代，从最遥远的祖先传到他们的后代，他们既是他们的继承人又是他们的后代。由于这种便利，这种印象传递得更加完整，并激起了更大程度的骄傲和虚荣心。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The case is the same with the transmission of the honours and fortune thro' a succession of males without their passing thro' any female. 'Tis a quality of human nature, which we shall consider <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-298" id="calibre_link-150" title="50">50</a></sup>afterwards, that the imagination naturally turns to whatever is important and considerable; and where two objects are presented to it, a small and a great one, usually leaves the former, and dwells entirely upon the latter. As in the society of marriage, the male sex has the advantage above the female, the husband first engages our attention; and whether we consider him directly, or reach him by passing thro' related objects, the thought both rests upon him with greater satisfaction, and arrives at him with greater facility than his consort. 'Tis easy to see, that this property must strengthen the child's relation to the father, and weaken that to the mother. For as all relations are nothing but a propensity to pass from one idea to another, whatever strengthens the propensity strengthens the relation; and as we have a stronger propensity to pass from the idea of the children to that of the father, than from the same idea to that of the mother, we ought to regard the former relation as the closer and more considerable. This is the reason why children commonly bear their father's name, and are esteem'd to be of nobler or baser birth, according to <i class="calibre10">his</i> family. And tho' the mother shou'd be possest of a superior spirit and genius to the father, as often happens, the <i class="calibre10">general rule</i> prevails, notwithstanding the exception, according to the doctrine above-explain'd. Nay even when a superiority of any kind is so great, or when any other reasons have such an effect, as to make the children rather represent the mother's family than the father's, the general rule still retains such an efficacy that it weakens the relation, and makes a kind of break in the line of ancestors. The imagination runs not along them with facility, nor is able to transfer the honour and credit of the ancestors to their posterity of the same name and family so readily, as when the transition is conformable to the general rules, and passes from father to son, or from brother to brother.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这种情况与通过男性继承荣誉和财富而不通过任何女性的情况是一样的。这是人性中的一个特质，我们将在后面考虑这个问题。 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-298" id="calibre_link-150" title="50">50</a></sup>想象力自然会转向任何重要的和可观的东西；如果有两个对象摆在它面前，一个小的和一个大的，通常会离开前者，而完全集中在后者。由于在婚姻社会中，男性比女性更有优势，丈夫首先吸引了我们的注意力；无论我们是直接考虑他，还是通过相关对象到达他，思想都会在他身上得到更大的满足，并比他的伴侣更容易到达他。很容易看出，这种特性必须加强孩子与父亲的关系，而削弱与母亲的关系。因为所有的关系都只是从一个观念到另一个观念的倾向，凡是能加强这种倾向的，就能加强这种关系；既然我们从孩子的观念到父亲的观念的倾向比从同一观念到母亲的观念的倾向更强，我们就应该把前者视为更密切和更重要的关系。这就是为什么孩子们通常都有他们父亲的名字，并根据<i class="calibre10">他的</i>家庭情况被认为是出身高贵或低贱的原因。尽管母亲拥有比父亲更高的精神和天才，但根据上述学说，尽管有例外情况，<i class="calibre10">一般规则</i>仍占上风。甚至当任何一种优越性是如此之大，或者当任何其他原因产生影响，使子女宁愿代表母亲的家庭而不是父亲的家庭时，一般规则仍然保持着这样的效力，它削弱了这种关系，并使祖先的血统出现了某种断裂。人们的想象力不会沿着他们轻松地运行，也不能像过渡期符合一般规则，从父亲到儿子，或从兄弟到兄弟那样，轻易地将祖先的荣誉和功劳转移到他们的同名同姓的后代。</p></div>

This relation 'twill be impossible for me fully to explain before I come to treat of justice and the other moral virtues. 'Tis sufficient to observe on this occasion, that property may be defin'd, <i class="calibre10">such a relation betwixt a person and a object as permits him, but forbids any other, the free use and possession of it, without violating the laws of justice and moral equity.</i> If justice, therefore, be a virtue, which has a natural and original influence on the human mind, property may be look'd upon as a particular species of <i class="calibre10">causation</i>; whether we consider the liberty it gives the proprietor to operate as he please upon the object, or the advantages, which he reaps from it. 'Tis the same case, if justice, according to the system of certain philosophers, shou'd be esteem'd an artificial and not a natural virtue. For then honour, and custom, and civil laws supply the place of natural conscience, and produce, in some degree, the same effects. This in the mean time is certain, that the mention of the property naturally carries our thought to the proprietor, and of the proprietor to the property; which being a proof of a perfect relation of ideas is all that is requisite to our present purpose. A relation of ideas, join'd to that of impressions, always produces a transition of affections; and therefore, whenever any pleasure or pain arises from an object, connected with us by property, we may be certain, that either pride or humility must arise from this conjunction of relations; if the foregoing system be solid and satisfactory.

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident the error of distinguishing power from its exercise proceeds not entirely from the scholastic doctrine of free-will, which, indeed, enters very little into common life, and has but small influence on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking. According to that doctrine, motives deprive us not of free-will, nor take away our power of performing or forbearing any action. But according to common notions a man has no power, where very considerable motives lie betwixt him and the satisfaction of his desires, and determine him to forbear what he wishes to perform. I do not think I have fallen into my enemies power, when I see him pass me in the streets with a sword by his side, while I am unprovided of any weapon. I know that the fear of the civil magistrate is as strong a restraint as any of iron, and that I am in as perfect safety as if he were chain'd or imprison'd. But when a person acquires such an authority over me, that not only there is no external obstacle to his actions; but also that he may punish or reward me as he pleases, without any dread of punishment in his turn, I then attribute a full power to him, and consider myself as his subject or vassal.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">显然，将权力与行使区分开来的错误并不完全来自于学术界的自由意志学说，事实上，这种学说很少进入普通生活，对我们粗俗和流行的思维方式影响很小。根据这一学说，动机并没有剥夺我们的自由意志，也没有夺走我们实施或放弃任何行动的能力。但根据普通的观念，一个人没有权力，因为在他和他的欲望的满足之间存在着非常大的动机，并决定他放弃他想做的事。当我看到他在街上与我擦肩而过时，而我却没有任何武器，我不认为我已经落入了敌人的手中。我知道，对民政官员的恐惧与任何铁的约束一样强大，我的安全就像他被锁住或被囚禁一样。但是，当一个人对我取得了这样的权威，不仅他的行动没有任何外部障碍，而且他可以随心所欲地惩罚或奖励我，而不担心反过来受到惩罚时，我就会把全部权力归于他，并把自己看作是他的臣民或附庸。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now if we compare these two cases, that of a person, who has very strong motives of interest or safety to forbear any action, and that of another, who lies under no such obligation, we shall find, according to the philosophy explain'd in the foregoing book, that the only <i class="calibre10">known</i> difference betwixt them lies in this, that in the former case we conclude from <i class="calibre10">past experience</i>, that the person never will perform that action, and in the latter, that he possibly or probably will perform it. Nothing is more fluctuating and inconstant on many occasions, than the will of man; nor is there any thing but strong motives, which can give us an absolute certainty in pronouncing concerning any of his future actions. When we see a person free from these motives, we suppose a possibility either of his acting or forbearing; and tho' in general we may conclude him to be determin'd by motives and causes, yet this removes not the uncertainty of our judgment concerning these causes, nor the influence of that uncertainty on the passions. Since therefore we ascribe a power of performing an action to every one, who has no very powerful motive to forbear it, and refuse it to such as have; it may justly be concluded, that <i class="calibre10">power</i> has always a reference to its <i class="calibre10">exercise</i>, either actual or probable, and that we consider a person as endow'd with any ability when we find from past experience, that 'tis probable, or at least possible he may exert it. And indeed, as our passions always regard the real existence of objects, and we always judge of this reality from past instances; nothing can be more likely of itself, without any farther reasoning, than that power consists in the possibility or probability of any action, as discover'd by experience and the practice of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，如果我们比较这两种情况，即一个有非常强烈的利益或安全动机的人和另一个没有这种义务的人，我们会发现，根据前述书中解释的哲学，它们之间唯一<i class="calibre10">已知的</i>区别在于：在前一种情况下，我们根据<i class="calibre10">过去的经验</i>得出结论，这个人永远不会采取这种行动，而在后一种情况下，他可能或可能会采取这种行动。在许多情况下，没有什么比人的意志更容易波动和不稳定的了；除了强烈的动机之外，也没有任何东西能让我们对他未来的任何行动有绝对的把握。当我们看到一个人没有这些动机时，我们就会认为他有可能行动或忍耐；虽然一般来说，我们可以断定他是由动机和原因决定的，但这并不能消除我们对这些原因判断的不确定性，也不能消除这种不确定性对激情的影响。因此，我们赋予每一个没有强大动机的人以行动的能力，而拒绝赋予有动机的人以行动的能力；我们可以合理地得出结论，<i class="calibre10">能力</i>总是指它的<i class="calibre10">行使</i>，无论是实际的还是可能的，当我们从过去的经验中发现一个人有可能，或者至少有可能行使它时，我们就认为他有任何能力。事实上，由于我们的激情总是考虑到对象的真实存在，而且我们总是从过去的例子中判断这种真实性；没有什么比权力本身更有可能，不需要任何进一步的推理，就像通过经验和世界的实践所发现的那样，权力包括任何行动的可能性或概率。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now 'tis evident, that wherever a person is in such a situation with regard to me, that there is no very powerful motive to deter him from injuring me, and consequently 'tis <i class="calibre10">uncertain</i> whether he will injure me or not, I must be uneasy in such a situation, and cannot consider the possibility or probability of that injury without a sensible concern. The passions are not only affected by such events as are certain and infallible, but also in an inferior degree by such as are possible and contingent. And tho' perhaps I never really feel any harm, and discover by the event, that, philosophically speaking, the person never had any power of harming me; since he did not exert any; this prevents not my uneasiness from the preceding uncertainty. The agreeable passions may here operate as well as the uneasy, and convey a pleasure when I perceive a good to become either possible or probable by the possibility or probability of another's bestowing it on me, upon the removal of any strong motives, which might formerly have hinder'd him.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在很明显，只要一个人对我来说处于这样的境地，没有非常强大的动机来阻止他伤害我，因此他是否会伤害我是<i class="calibre10">不确定的</i>，在这种情况下，我一定会感到不安，而且不能在不考虑伤害的可能性或概率的情况下感到担忧。激情不仅受到确定的和无懈可击的事件的影响，而且还受到可能的和偶然的事件的影响，其程度较低。尽管我可能从未真正感受到任何伤害，并通过事件发现，从哲学上讲，这个人从未有任何伤害我的能力；因为他没有施加任何伤害；这并不妨碍我因前面的不确定性而感到不安。愉快的激情在这里可以和不安的激情一样发挥作用，当我意识到在消除了以前可能阻碍他的任何强烈动机之后，由于另一个人可能或有可能给我带来好处，我就会感到高兴。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But we may farther observe, that this satisfaction encreases, when any good approaches in such a manner that it is in one's <i class="calibre10">own</i> power to take or leave it, and there neither is any physical impediment, nor any very strong motive to hinder our enjoyment. As all men desire pleasure, nothing can be more probable, than its existence when there is no external obstacle to the producing it, and men perceive no danger in following their inclinations. In that case their imagination easily anticipates the satisfaction, and conveys the same joy, as if they were persuaded of its real and actual existence.</p>

For farther satisfaction on this head I must refer to my account of the will, where I shall<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-353" id="calibre_link-17" title="51">51</a></sup> explain that false sensation of liberty, which makes us imagine we can perform any thing, that is not very dangerous or destructive. Whenever any other person is under no strong obligations of interest to forbear any pleasure, we judge from <i class="calibre10">experience</i>, that the pleasure will exist, and that he will probably obtain it But when ourselves are in that situation, we judge from an <i class="calibre10">illusion of the fancy</i>, that the pleasure is still closer and more immediate. The will seems to move easily every way, and casts a shadow or image of itself, even to that side, on which it did not settle. By means of this image the enjoyment seems to approach nearer to us, and gives us the same lively satisfaction, as if it were perfectly certain and unavoidable.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. This is not only conspicuous in children, who implicitly embrace every opinion propos'd to them; but also in men of the greatest judgment and understanding, who find it very difficult to follow their own reason or inclination, in opposition to that of their friends and daily companions. To this principle we ought to ascribe the great uniformity we may observe in the humours and turn of thinking of those of the same nation; and 'tis much more probable, that this resemblance arises from sympathy, than from any influence of the soil and climate which tho' they continue invariably the same, are not able to preserve the character of a nation the same for a century together. A good-natur'd man finds himself in an instant of the same humour with his company; and even the proudest and most surly take a tincture from their countrymen and acquaintance. A chearful countenance infuses a sensible complacency and serenity into my mind; as an angry or sorrowful one throws a sudden damp upon me. Hatred, resentment, esteem, love, courage, mirth and melancholy; all these passions I feel more from communication than from my own natural temper and disposition. So remarkable a phænomenon merits our attention, and must be trac'd up to its first principles. When any affection is infus'd by sympathy, it is at first known only by its effects, and by those external signs in the countenance and conversation, which convey an idea of it. This idea is presently converted into an impression, and acquires such a degree of force and vivacity, as to become the very passion itself, and produce an equal emotion, as any original affection. However instantaneous this change of the idea into an impression may be, it proceeds from certain views and reflections, which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a philosopher, tho' they may the person himself, who makes them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">人性中最突出的品质，无论从其本身还是从其后果来看，都莫过于我们有同情他人的倾向，并通过交流接受他们的倾向和情感，无论其与我们自己的倾向和情感如何不同，甚至相反。这不仅在儿童身上很明显，他们会默默地接受向他们提出的每一个意见；而且在具有最强判断力和理解力的人身上也很明显，他们发现很难遵循自己的理由或倾向，与他们的朋友和日常伙伴的意见相悖。我们应该把我们在同一民族的人的幽默感和思维方式中观察到的巨大的一致性归功于这个原则；而且，这种相似性更有可能来自于同情，而不是来自于土壤和气候的任何影响，因为土壤和气候虽然始终如一，却无法使一个民族的性格在一个世纪内保持不变。一个好脾气的人在一瞬间就会发现自己和他的同伴有同样的幽默感；甚至最骄傲和最傲慢的人也会从他们的同胞和熟人那里得到一种暗示。一个愉快的面孔会给我的头脑注入一种明智的自满和宁静；而一个愤怒或悲伤的面孔则会让我突然感到潮湿。仇恨、怨恨、尊敬、爱、勇气、欢笑和忧郁；所有这些激情我都是从交流中感受到的，而不是从我自己的自然脾气和性情中感受到的。如此显著的现象值得我们注意，而且必须追溯到它的最初原则。当任何感情因同情而被注入时，起初只能通过其效果，以及通过脸部和谈话中的那些外部迹象来了解它，从而传达出一种想法。这种想法很快就会转化为一种印象，并获得如此程度的力量和活力，以至于成为激情本身，并产生一种与任何原始感情相同的情感。无论这种观念转化为印象的过程是多么瞬息万变，它都来自于某些观点和思考，而这些观点和思考是无法逃脱哲学家的严格审查的，尽管它们可能会被制造它们的人自己发现。</p></div>

The case is the same with the fabric of the mind, as with that of the body. However the parts may differ in shape or size, their structure and composition are in general the same. There is a very remarkable resemblance, which preserves itself amidst all their variety; and this resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others, and embrace them with facility and pleasure. Accordingly we find, that where, beside the general resemblance of our natures, there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy.

The component parts of ideas and impressions are precisely alike. The manner and order of their appearance may be the same. The different degrees of their force and vivacity are, therefore, the only particulars, that distinguish them: And as this difference may be remov'd, in some measure, by a relation betwixt the impressions and ideas, 'tis no wonder an idea of a sentiment or passion, may by this means be so inliven'd as to become the very sentiment or passion. The lively idea of any object always approaches its impression; and 'tis certain we may feel sickness and pain from the mere force of imagination, and make a malady real by often thinking of it. But this is most remarkable in the opinions and affections; and 'tis there principally that a lively idea is converted into an impression. Our affections depend more upon ourselves, and the internal operations of the mind, than any other impressions; for which reason they arise more naturally from the imagination, and from every lively idea we form of them. This is the nature and cause of sympathy; and 'tis after this manner we enter so deep into the opinions and affections of others, whenever we discover them.</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">What is principally remarkable in this whole affair is the strong confirmation these phænomena give to the foregoing system concerning the understanding, and consequently to the present one conceding the passions; since these are analogous to each other. 'Tis indeed evident, that when we sympathize with the passions and sentiments of others, these movements appear at first in <i class="calibre10">our</i> mind as mere ideas, and are conceiv'd to belong to another person, as we conceive any other matter of fact. 'Tis also evident, that the ideas of the affections of others are converted into the very impressions they represent, and that the passions arise in conformity to the images we form of them. All this is an object of the plainest experience, and depends not on any hypothesis of philosophy. That science can only be admitted to explain the phænomena; tho' at the same time it must be confest, they are so clear of themselves, that there is but little occasion to employ it. For besides the relation of cause and effect, by which we are convinc'd of the reality of the passion, with which we sympathize; besides this, I say, we must be assisted by the relations of resemblance and contiguity, in order to feel the sympathy in its full perfection. And since these relations can entirely convert an idea into an impression, and convey the vivacity of the latter into the former, so perfectly as to lose nothing of it in the transition, we may easily conceive how the relation of cause and effect alone, may serve to strengthen and inliven an idea. In sympathy there is an evident conversion of an idea into an impression. This conversion arises from the relation of objects to ourself. Ourself is always intimately present to us. Let us compare all these circumstances, and we shall find, that sympathy is exactly correspondent to the operations of our understanding; and even contains something more surprising and extraordinary. ’Tis now time to turn our view from the general consideration of sympathy, to its influence on pride and humility, when these passions arise from praise and blame, from reputation and infamy. We may observe, that no person is ever prais'd by another for any quality, which wou'd not, if real, produce, of itself, a pride in the person possest of it. The elogiums either turn upon his power, or riches, or family, or virtue; all of which are subjects of vanity, that we have already explain'd and accounted for. 'Tis certain, then, that if a person consider'd himself in the same light, in which he appears to his admirer, he wou'd first receive a separate pleasure, and afterwards a pride or self-satisfaction, according to the hypothesis above explain'd. Now nothing is more natural than for us to embrace the opinions of others in this particular; both from <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>, which renders all their sentiments intimately present to us; and from <i class="calibre10">reasoning</i>, which makes us regard their judgment, as a kind of argument for what they affirm. These two principles of authority and sympathy influence almost all our opinions; but must have a peculiar influence, when we judge of our own worth and character. Such judgments are always attended with passion<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-422" id="calibre_link-436" title="53">53</a></sup>; and nothing tends more to disturb our understanding, and precipitate us into any opinions, however unreasonable, than their connexion with passion; which diffuses itself over the imagination, and gives an additional force to every related idea. To which we may add, that being conscious of great partiality in our own favour, we are peculiarly pleas'd with any thing, that confirms the good opinion we have of ourselves, and are easily shock'd with whatever opposes it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more usual than for men of good families, but narrow circumstances, to leave their friends and country, and rather seek their livelihood by mean and mechanical employments among strangers, than among those, who are acquainted with their birth and education. We shall be unknown, say they, where we go. No body will suspect from what family we are sprung. We shall be remov'd from all our friends and acquaintance, and our poverty and meanness will by that means lit more easy upon us. In examining these sentiments, I find they afford many very convincing arguments for my present purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">没有什么比家境好但条件差的人离开他们的朋友和国家，宁可在陌生人中以卑鄙和机械的工作谋生，而不是在那些熟悉他们的出身和教育的人中谋生更常见的了。他们说，我们到哪里都会默默无闻。没有人会怀疑我们来自哪个家庭。我们将远离所有的朋友和熟人，而我们的贫穷和卑微也将因此而变得更加容易。在研究这些观点时，我发现它们为我目前的目的提供了许多非常有说服力的论据。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First, We may infer from them, that the uneasiness of being contemn'd depends on sympathy, and that sympathy depends on the relation of objects to ourselves; since we are most uneasy under the contempt of persons, who are both related to us by blood, and contiguous in place. Hence we seek to diminish this sympathy and uneasiness by separating these relations, and placing ourselves in a contiguity to strangers, and at a distance from relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先，我们可以从中推断出，被蔑视的不安取决于同情心，而同情心又取决于对象与我们的关系；因为我们在被蔑视时最不安，因为这些人与我们有血缘关系，而且位置相邻。因此，我们试图通过分离这些关系来减少这种同情和不安，并将自己置于与陌生人相邻的位置，与亲属保持距离。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, We may conclude, that relations are requisite to sympathy, not absolutely consider'd as relations, but by their influence in converting our ideas of the sentiments of others into the very sentiments, by means of the association betwixt the idea of their persons, and that of our own. For here the relations of kindred and contiguity both subsist; but not being united in the same persons, they contribute in a less to the sympathy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，我们可以得出结论，关系是同情的必要条件，不是绝对的关系，而是通过它们的影响，把我们对他人情感的想法转化为非常的情感，通过对他们的人的想法和我们自己的想法之间的联系。因为在这里，亲属关系和毗邻关系都存在；但由于没有在同一个人身上结合起来，它们对同情的贡献较小。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, This very circumstance of the diminution of sympathy by the separation of relations is worthy of our attention. Suppose I am plac'd in a poor condition among strangers, and consequently am but lightly treated; I yet find myself easier in that situation, than when I was every day expos'd to the contempt of my kindred and countrymen. Here I feel a double contempt; from my relations, but they are absent; from those about me, but they are strangers. This double contempt is likewise strengthen'd by the two relations of kindred and contiguity. But as the persons are not the same, who are connected with me by those two relations, this difference of ideas separates the impressions arising from the contempt, and keeps them from running into each other. The contempt of my neighbours has a certain influence; as has also that of my kindred: But these influences are distinct, and never unite; as when the contempt proceeds from persons who are at once both my neighbours and kindred. This phænomenon is analogous to the system of pride and humility above-explain'd, which may seem so extraordinary to vulgar apprehensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，这种因亲属分离而使同情心减少的情况值得我们注意。假设我被安置在陌生人中间，处境很差，因此受到轻视；但我发现我在这种情况下比我每天都受到我的亲属和同胞的蔑视时要轻松。在这里，我感到双重的蔑视；来自我的亲人，但他们不在；来自我身边的人，但他们是陌生人。这种双重蔑视也同样因亲属和邻里这两种关系而得到加强。但是，由于与我有这两种关系的人并不一样，这种观念上的差异将由蔑视产生的印象分开，使它们不至于相互冲撞。我的邻居的蔑视有一定的影响，我的亲属的蔑视也有一定的影响：但这些影响是不同的，从来没有结合在一起；当蔑视来自既是我的邻居又是我的亲属的人的时候。这种现象类似于上面所解释的骄傲和谦卑的体系，这在普通人的理解中可能显得很不寻常。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Fourthly, A person in these circumstances naturally conceals his birth from those among whom he lives, and is very uneasy, if any one suspects him to be of a family, much superior to his present fortune and way of living. Every thing in this world is judg'd of by comparison. What is an immense fortune for a private gentleman is beggary for a prince. A peasant wou'd think himself happy in what cannot afford necessaries for a gentleman. When a man has either been accustom'd to a more splendid way of living, or thinks himself intitled to it by his birth and quality, every thing below is disagreeable and even shameful; and 'tis with the greatest industry he conceals his pretensions to a better fortune. Here he himself knows his misfortunes; but as those, with whom he lives, are ignorant of them, he has the disagreeable reflection and comparison suggested only by his own thoughts, and never receives it by a sympathy with others; which must contribute very much to his ease and satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第四，在这种情况下，一个人自然会向他所生活的人隐瞒他的出身，如果有人怀疑他的家庭比他现在的财富和生活方式要好得多，他就会感到非常不安。这个世界上的每一件事都是通过比较来判断的。对一个普通的绅士来说是一笔巨大的财富，而对一个王子来说就是乞丐。一个农民会认为自己很幸福，因为他负担不起一个绅士的必需品。当一个人已经习惯了更华丽的生活方式，或者认为自己的出身和品质使他有资格享受这种生活时，下面的一切都令人不快，甚至是可耻的；他用最大的努力来掩饰他对更好财富的追求。在这里，他自己知道自己的不幸；但由于与他生活在一起的人对这些不幸一无所知，他只有通过自己的想法来进行令人不快的反思和比较，而从未通过与他人的同情来接受这种反思和比较；这对他的轻松和满足肯定有很大帮助。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If there be any objections to this hypothesis, <i class="calibre10">that the pleasure, which we receive from praise, arises from a communication of sentiments,</i> we shall find, upon examination, that these objections, when taken in a proper light, will serve to confirm it. Popular fame may be agreeable even to a man, who despises the vulgar; but 'tis because their multitude gives them additional weight and authority. Plagiaries are delighted with praises, which they are conscious they do not deserve; but this is a kind of castle-building, where the imagination amuses itself with its own fictions, and strives to render them firm and stable by a sympathy with the sentiments of others. Proud men are most shock'd with contempt, tho' they do not most readily assent to it; but 'tis because of the opposition betwixt the passion, which is natural to them, and that receiv'd by sympathy. A violent lover in like manner is very much displeas'd when you blame and condemn his love; tho' 'tis evident your opposition can have no influence, but by the hold it takes of himself, and by his sympathy with you. If he despises you, or perceives you are in jest, whatever you say has no effect upon him.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果对这一假设有任何反对意见，<i class="calibre10">即我们从赞美中得到的快乐来自于情感的交流，那么</i>，经过研究，我们会发现，这些反对意见，如果从适当的角度来看，将有助于证实这一假设。即使对一个鄙视庸俗的人来说，大众的名声也可能是令人满意的；但这是因为他们的人数给了他们更多的重量和权威。剽窃者对赞美感到高兴，因为他们知道自己不配得到这些赞美；但这是一种城堡建设，想象力以自己的虚构为乐，并努力通过同情他人的情感来使它们变得坚定和稳定。骄傲的人最容易受到蔑视的冲击，尽管他们并不是最容易同意的；但这是因为他们自然的激情和通过同情得到的激情之间的对立。同样，当你指责和谴责他的爱时，一个暴躁的情人会非常不高兴；尽管你的反对显然不会有任何影响，但它对他自己的影响，以及他对你的同情。如果他看不起你，或者认为你是在开玩笑，你说什么对他都没有影响。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus in whatever light we consider this subject, we may still observe, that the causes of pride and humility correspond exactly to our hypothesis, and that nothing can excite either of these passions, unless it be both related to ourselves, and produces a pleasure or pain independent of the passion. We have not only prov'd, that a tendency to produce pleasure or pain is common to all the causes of pride or humility, but also that 'tis the only thing, which is common; and consequently is the quality, by which they operate. We have farther prov'd, that the most considerable causes of these passions are really nothing but the power of producing either agreeable or uneasy sensations; and therefore that all their effects, and amongst the rest, pride and humility, are deriv'd solely from that origin. Such simple and natural principles, founded on such solid proofs, cannot fail to be receiv'd by philosophers, unless oppos'd by some objections, that have escap'd me.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，无论我们从什么角度来考虑这个问题，我们仍然可以看到，骄傲和谦卑的原因与我们的假设完全一致，没有任何东西可以激起这些激情中的任何一个，除非它与我们自己有关，并产生独立于激情的快乐或痛苦。我们不仅证明了产生快乐或痛苦的倾向是所有导致骄傲或谦卑的原因所共有的，而且也证明了这是唯一共有的东西，因此也是它们运作的质量。我们已经进一步证明，这些激情的最主要原因其实不过是产生愉快或不愉快的感觉的能力；因此，它们的所有影响，以及其中的骄傲和谦卑，都完全来自于这个来源。这样简单而自然的原则，建立在这样坚实的证据之上，不可能不被哲学家们所接受，除非有一些反对意见，而这些反对意见在我看来是逃避不了的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis usual with anatomists to join their observations and experiments on human bodies to those on beasts, and from the agreement of these experiments to derive an additional argument for any particular hypothesis. 'Tis indeed certain, that where the structure of parts in brutes is the same as in men, and the operation of these parts also the same, the causes of that operation cannot be different, and that whatever we discover to be true of the one species, may be concluded without hesitation to be certain of the other. Thus tho' the mixture of humours and the composition of minute parts may justly be presum'd to be somewhat different in men from what it is in mere animals; and therefore any experiment we make upon the one concerning the effects of medicines will not always apply to the other; yet as the structure of the veins and muscles, the fabric and situation of the heart, of the lungs, the stomach, the liver and other parts, are the same or nearly the same in all animals, the very same hypothesis, which in one species explains muscular motion, the progress of the chyle, the circulation of the blood, must be applicable to every one; and according as it agrees or disagrees with the experiments we may make in any species of creatures, we may draw a proof of its truth or falshood on the whole. Let us, therefore, apply this method of enquiry, which is found so just and useful in reasonings concerning the body, to our present anatomy of the mind, and see what discoveries we can make by it. In order to this we must first shew the correspondence of <i class="calibre10">passions</i> in men and animals, and afterwards compare the causes, which produce these passions.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">解剖学家通常将他们对人体的观察和实验与对野兽的观察和实验结合起来，并从这些实验的一致性中为任何特定的假设得出额外的论据。确实可以肯定的是，如果畜生和人的部位结构相同，这些部位的运作也相同，那么运作的原因就不可能不同，无论我们发现一个物种的情况如何，都可以毫不犹豫地断定另一个物种的情况也是如此。因此，尽管可以合理地推测，人与动物之间的混合液和细微部分的组成有些不同；因此，我们在一个人身上做的关于药物效果的任何实验，并不总是适用于另一个人。然而，由于静脉和肌肉的结构，心脏、肺、胃、肝和其他部位的结构和情况，在所有动物中都是相同或几乎相同的，因此，在一个物种中解释肌肉运动、胆汁的流动和血液循环的同一假设，必须适用于每一个物种；根据它与我们在任何物种中进行的实验的一致或不一致，我们可以从整体上证明它的真理或谬误。因此，让我们把这种在有关身体的推理中被发现是如此公正和有用的询问方法应用于我们目前的心灵解剖学，并看看我们能通过它有什么发现。为了做到这一点，我们必须首先说明人和动物的<i class="calibre10">激情</i>的对应关系，然后比较产生这些激情的原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis plain, that almost in every species of creatures, but especially of the nobler kind, there are many evident marks of pride and humility. The very port and gait of a swan, or turkey, or peacock show the high idea he has entertain'd of himself; and his contempt of all others. This is the more remarkable, that in the two last species of animals, the pride always attends the beauty, and is discover'd in the male only. The vanity and emulation of nightingales in singing have been commonly remark'd; as likewise that of horses in swiftness, of hounds in sagacity and smell, of the bull and cock in strength, and of every other animal in his particular excellency. Add to this, that every species of creatures, which approach so often to man, as to familiarize themselves with him, show an evident pride in his approbation, and are pleas'd with his praises and caresses, independent of every other consideration. Nor are they the caresses of every one without distinction, which give them this vanity, but those principally of the persons they know and love; in the same manner as that passion is excited in mankind. All these are evident proofs, that pride and humility are not merely human passions, but extend themselves over the whole animal creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，几乎每一种生物，尤其是高贵的生物，都有许多明显的傲慢和谦卑的标志。天鹅、火鸡或孔雀的头部和步态都显示出它对自己的崇高理念，以及对所有其他人的蔑视。这一点更值得注意，因为在后两种动物中，骄傲总是伴随着美貌，而且只在雄性身上发现。夜莺在歌唱方面的虚荣心和仿效行为已被普遍提及；同样，马的敏捷性、猎犬的敏锐性和嗅觉、公牛和公鸡的力量，以及其他每一种动物的特殊优点也是如此。此外，每一种生物，只要经常接近人类，熟悉他，就会对他的赞许表现出明显的自豪感，并以他的赞美和爱抚为乐，而不考虑其他任何因素。也不是每个人的爱抚都让他们产生这种虚荣心，而是主要是他们所认识和喜爱的人的爱抚；就像这种激情在人类中激发的方式一样。所有这些都是明显的证据，证明骄傲和谦卑不仅仅是人类的激情，而是扩展到整个动物界。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">causes</i> of these passions are likewise much the same in beasts as in us, making a just allowance for our superior knowledge and understanding. Thus animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice; they quickly lose sight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of that of right and property: For which reason the causes of their pride and humility must lie solely in the body, and can never be plac'd either in the mind or external objects. But so far as regards the body, the same qualities cause pride in the animal as in the human kind; and 'tis on beauty, strength, swiftness or some other useful or agreeable quality that this passion is always founded.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">导致这些激情的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>在野兽身上和在我们身上也是一样的，这是对我们优越的知识和理解力的充分考虑。因此，动物很少或根本没有美德或恶习的意识；它们很快就会失去对血缘关系的认识；也没有能力认识权利和财产。因此，它们的骄傲和谦卑的原因必须完全在于身体，而不可能在心灵或外物上得到解决。但就身体而言，动物的骄傲和人类的骄傲是由同样的品质引起的；这种激情总是建立在美貌、力量、敏捷或其他有用或令人愉快的品质上。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The next question is, whether, since those passions are the same, and arise from the same causes thro' the whole creation, the <i class="calibre10">manner</i>, in which the causes operate, be also the same. According to all rules of analogy, this is justly to be expected; and if we find upon trial, that the explication of these phænomena, which we make use of in one species, will not apply to the rest, we may presume that that explication, however specious, is in reality without foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">下一个问题是，既然这些激情是相同的，并且从整个创造物的相同原因中产生，那么这些原因的运作<i class="calibre10">方式</i>是否也是相同的。根据所有的类比规则，这是理所当然的；如果我们在试验中发现，我们在一个物种中使用的对这些现象的解释并不适用于其他物种，我们就可以推测，这种解释，无论多么似是而非，实际上都是没有根据的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to decide this question, let us consider, that there is evidently the same <i class="calibre10">relation</i> of ideas, and deriv'd from the same causes, in the minds of animals as in those of men. A dog, that has hid a bone, often forgets the place; but when brought to it, his thought passes easily to what he formerly conceal'd, by means of the contiguity, which produces a relation among his ideas. In like manner, when he has been heartily beat in any place, he will tremble on his approach to it, even tho' he discover no signs of any present danger. The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable; but as that relation makes a considerable ingredient in causation, of which all animals shew so evident a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation operate in the same manner upon beasts as upon human creatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了决定这个问题，让我们考虑一下，在动物和人的头脑中，显然存在着同样的观念<i class="calibre10">关系</i>，而且是由同样的原因产生的。一只藏了骨头的狗，常常会忘记那个地方；但当它被带到那个地方时，它的思想就会很容易地转移到它以前藏起来的东西上，这是由于相邻的关系，在它的观念中产生一种关系。同样地，当他在任何地方被打得心惊肉跳时，他在接近它时就会发抖，即使他没有发现任何危险的迹象。相似的效果并不明显；但由于这种关系在因果关系中占有相当大的比重，而所有的动物都表现出如此明显的判断力，我们可以得出结论，相似、相邻和因果这三种关系在野兽身上的运作方式与在人类身上的运作方式相同。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There are also instances of the relation of impressions, sufficient to convince us, that there is an union of certain affections with each other in the inferior species of creatures as well as in the superior, and that their minds are frequently convey'd thro' a series of connected emotions. A dog, when elevated with joy, runs naturally into love and kindness, whether of his master or of the sex. In like manner, when full of pain and sorrow, he becomes quarrelsome and ill-natur’d; and that passion, which at first was grief, is by the smallest occasion converted into anger.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">还有一些关于印象关系的例子，足以使我们相信，在低等生物和高等生物中，某些情感是相互结合的，它们的思想经常通过一系列相关的情感来传达。一只狗，当高兴起来的时候，就会自然而然地跑到爱和仁慈中去，不管是对它的主人还是对性。同样，当它充满痛苦和悲伤的时候，它就会变得争吵和不耐烦；起初是悲伤的激情，在最小的情况下就会转化为愤怒。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus all the internal principles, that are necessary in us to produce either pride or humility, are common to all creatures; and since the causes, which excite these passions, are likewise the same, we may justly conclude, that these causes operate after the same <i class="calibre10">manner</i> thro' the whole animal creation. My hypothesis is so simple, and supposes so little reflection and judgement, that 'tis applicable to every sensible creature; which must not only be allow'd to be a convincing proof of its veracity, but, I am confident, will be found an objection to every other system.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在我们身上产生骄傲或谦卑所必需的所有内部原则，对所有生物来说都是共同的；既然激发这些激情的原因也是相同的，我们就可以合理地得出结论，这些原因以同样的<i class="calibre10">方式</i>在整个动物界发挥作用。我的假设是如此简单，而且假设的思考和判断力如此之小，以至于适用于每一种有感觉的生物；这不仅必须被允许成为其真实性的一个令人信服的证明，而且，我相信，会被发现是对所有其他系统的反对。</p></div>

'Twou'd be as unnecessary to attempt any description of them, drawn from their nature, origin, causes and objects; and that both because these are the subjects of our present enquiry, and because these passions of themselves are sufficiently known from our common feeling and experience. This we have already observ'd conceding pride and humility, and here repeat it concerning love and hatred; and indeed there is so great a resemblance betwixt these two sets of passions, that we shall be oblig'd to begin with a kind of abridgment of our reasonings concerning the former, in order to explain the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">完全不可能给<i class="calibre10">爱与恨</i>的激情下任何定义；这是因为它们只是产生一种简单的印象，没有任何混合或组成。试图从它们的性质、起源、原因和对象来描述它们也是不必要的；这是因为这些都是我们目前讨论的主题，也因为这些激情本身已经从我们的普通感觉和经验中充分了解。这一点我们在承认骄傲和谦卑时已经注意到了，这里再重复一下关于爱和恨的问题；事实上，这两组激情之间有很大的相似之处，以至于我们不得不先对我们关于前者的推理进行某种删节，以便解释后者。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As the immediate <i class="calibre10">object</i> of pride and humility is self or that identical person, of whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are intimately conscious; so the <i class="calibre10">object</i> of love and hatred is some other person, of whose thoughts, actions, and sensations we are not conscious. This is sufficiently evident from experience. Our love and hatred are always directed to some sensible being external to us; and when we talk of <i class="calibre10">self-love</i>, 'tis not in a proper sense, nor has the sensation it produces any thing in common with that tender emotion, which is excited by a friend or mistress. 'Tis the same case with hatred. We may be mortified by our own faults and follies; but never feel any anger or hatred, except from the injuries of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">正如骄傲和谦卑的直接<i class="calibre10">对象</i>是自己或那个相同的人，我们对他的思想、行动和感觉有密切的意识；因此，爱和恨的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>是其他一些人，我们对他的思想、行动和感觉没有意识到。这一点从经验中就可以看出来。我们的爱和恨总是针对我们外部的某种可感知的存在；当我们谈论<i class="calibre10">自爱</i>时，这不是在适当的意义上，它所产生的感觉也与那种由朋友或女主人激发的温柔情感没有任何共同之处。仇恨的情况也是如此。我们可能会因为自己的错误和愚蠢而感到羞愧；但除非是因为别人的伤害，否则永远不会感到愤怒或憎恨。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' the object of love and hatred be always some other person, 'tis plain that the object is not, properly speaking, the cause of these passions, or alone sufficient to excite them. For since love and hatred are directly contrary in their sensation, and have the same object in common, if that object were also their cause, it wou'd produce these opposite passions in an equal degree; and as they must, from the very first moment, destroy each other, none of them wou'd ever be able to make its appearance. There must, therefore, be some cause different from the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管爱和恨的对象总是其他的人，但很明显，正确地说，这个对象并不是这些激情的原因，或者说，仅仅是足以激起这些激情。因为既然爱和恨在感觉上是直接相反的，而且有共同的对象，如果这个对象也是它们的原因，它就会在同等程度上产生这些相反的激情；而且，由于它们必须从一开始就相互摧毁，它们中的任何一个都不会出现。因此，必须有一些不同于对象的原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If we consider the causes of love and hatred, we shall find they are very much diversify'd, and have not many things in common. The virtue, knowledge, wit, good sense, good humour of any person, produce love and esteem; as the opposite qualities, hatred and contempt. The same passions arise from bodily accomplishments, such as beauty, force, swiftness, dexterity; and from their contraries; as likewise from the external advantages and disadvantages of family, possessions, cloaths, nation and climate. There is not one of these objects, but what by its different qualities may produce love and esteem, or hatred and contempt.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我们考虑爱与恨的原因，我们会发现它们非常多样化，没有多少共同点。任何一个人的美德、知识、智慧、理智、幽默，都会产生爱和敬意；相反的品质则会产生恨和蔑视。同样的激情来自于身体上的成就，如美貌、力量、敏捷、灵巧；也来自于它们的反面；同样也来自于家庭、财产、衣着、国家和气候等外部优势和劣势。在这些对象中，没有一个对象会因其不同的品质而产生爱和敬意，或憎恨和蔑视。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">

These two lines of communication or connexion form two opposite sides of the square. Again, pride and love are agreeable passions; hatred and humility uneasy. This similitude of sensation betwixt pride and love, and that betwixt humility and hatred form a new connexion, and may be consider'd as the other two sides of the square.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I say then, that nothing can produce any of these passions without bearing it a double relation, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> of ideas to the object of the passion, and of sensation to the passion itself This we must prove by our experiments.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，我说，没有任何东西能产生这些激情，而不与它发生双重关系，<i class="calibre10">即</i>观念与激情的对象，以及感觉与激情本身的关系，这一点我们必须通过实验来证明。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">First Experiment. To proceed with the greater order in these experiments, let us first suppose, that being plac'd in the situation above-mention'd, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> in company with some other person, there is an object presented, that has no relation either of impressions or ideas to any of these passions. Thus suppose we regard together an ordinary stone, or other common object, belonging to neither of us, and causing of itself no emotion, or independent pain and pleasure: 'Tis evident such an object will produce none of these four passions. Let us try it upon each of them successively. Let us apply it to love, to hatred, to humility, to pride; none of them ever arises in the smallest degree imaginable. Let us change the object, as oft as we please, provided still we choose one, that has neither of these two relations. Let us repeat the experiment in all the dispositions, of which the mind is susceptible. No object, in the vast variety of nature, will, in any disposition, produce any passion without these relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第一个实验。为了更好地进行这些实验，让我们首先假设，在上述情况下，<i class="calibre10">即</i>与其他一些人在一起时，有一个物体出现，它与这些激情中的任何一种都没有印象或想法的关系。因此，假设我们一起看一块普通的石头，或其他普通的物体，它不属于我们任何一方，本身也不会引起任何情绪，或独立的痛苦和快乐：显然，这样的物体不会产生这四种激情。让我们依次对它们中的每一个进行试验。让我们把它用于爱，用于恨，用于谦卑，用于骄傲；它们中没有一个会在可以想象的最小程度上出现。让我们随心所欲地改变对象，只要我们仍然选择一个没有这两种关系的对象。让我们在心智易受影响的所有倾向中重复这个实验。在自然界的巨大变化中，没有任何物体在没有这些关系的情况下，会在任何处置中产生任何激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Second Experiment. Since an object, that wants both these relations can ever produce any passion, let us bestow on it only one of these relations; and see what will follow. Thus suppose, I regard a stone or any common object, that belongs either to me or my companion, and by that means acquires a relation of ideas to the object of the passions: ’Tis plain, that to consider the matter <i class="calibre10">a priori</i> no emotion of any kind can reasonably be expected. For besides, that a relation of ideas operates secretly and calmly on the mind, it bestows an equal impulse towards the opposite passions of pride and humility, love and hatred, according as the object belongs to ourselves or others; which opposition of the passions must destroy both, and leave the mind perfectly free from any affection or emotion. This reasoning <i class="calibre10">a priori</i> is confirmed by experience. No trivial or vulgar object, that causes not a pain or pleasure, independent of the passion, will ever, by its property or other relations, either to ourselves or others, be able to produce the affections of pride or humility, love or hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二个实验。既然一个想要这两种关系的物体能够产生任何激情，让我们只赋予它其中一种关系；看看会发生什么。因此，假设我看到一块石头或任何普通物体，它要么属于我，要么属于我的同伴，并通过这种方式获得了与激情对象的观念关系。很明显，如果<i class="calibre10">先验</i>地考虑这个问题，就不可能合理地期待任何形式的情感。因为除了观念的关系秘密而平静地作用于心灵之外，它还根据对象是属于我们自己还是属于他人，对傲慢和谦卑、爱和恨等相反的激情给予同样的冲动；激情的对立必须摧毁两者，并使心灵完全不受任何感情或情绪影响。这种<i class="calibre10">先验</i>的推理得到了经验的证实。任何琐碎或庸俗的物体，只要不引起痛苦或快乐，独立于激情之外，就会因其属性或其他关系，无论是对我们自己还是对他人，都能产生骄傲或谦卑、爱或恨的情感。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Third Experiment. 'Tis evident, therefore, that a relation of ideas is not able alone to give rise to these affections. Let us now remove this relation, and in its stead place a relation of impressions, by presenting an object, which is agreeable or disagreeable, but has no relation either to ourself or companion; and let us observe the consequences. To consider the matter first <i class="calibre10">a priori</i>, as in the preceding experiment; we may conclude, that the object will have a small, but an uncertain connexion with these passions. For besides, that this relation is not a cold and imperceptible one, it has not the inconvenience of the relation of ideas, nor directs us with equal force to two contrary passions, which by their opposition destroy each other. But if we consider, on the other hand, that this transition from the sensation to the affection is not forwarded by any principle, that produces a transition of ideas; but, on the contrary, that tho' the one impression be easily transfus'd into the other, yet the change of objects is suppos'd contrary to all the principles, that cause a transition of that kind; we may from thence infer, that nothing will ever be a steady or durable cause of any passion, that is connected with the passion merely by a relation of impressions. What our reason wou'd conclude from analogy, after balancing these arguments, wou'd be, that an object, which produces pleasure or uneasiness, but has no manner of connexion either with ourselves or others, may give such a turn to the disposition, as that it may naturally fall into pride or love, humility or hatred, and search for other objects, upon which, by a double relation, it can found these affections; but that an object, which has only one of these relations, tho' the most advantageous one, can never give rise to any constant and establish'd passion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三次实验。因此，很明显的是，观念的关系并不能单独引起这些情感的产生。现在让我们消除这种关系，代之以印象的关系，提出一个对象，它是令人愉快或不愉快的，但与我们自己或同伴没有关系；让我们观察其结果。<i class="calibre10">先验</i>地考虑这个问题，就像在前面的实验中一样；我们可以得出结论，这个物体将与这些激情有一个小的、但不确定的联系。因为除了这种关系不是冷冰冰的、难以察觉的关系外，它没有观念关系的不便，也没有以同样的力量把我们引向两种相反的激情，而这两种激情由于它们的对立而互相毁灭。但如果我们考虑到，另一方面，从感觉到感情的这种转变并不是由任何产生观念转变的原则推动的；相反，尽管一种印象很容易转化为另一种印象，但对象的变化被认为是与导致这种转变的所有原则相违背的；我们可以由此推断，没有任何东西会成为任何激情的稳定或持久的原因，而这种激情仅仅是通过印象的关系而与之相连。在平衡了这些论点之后，我们的理性从类比中得出的结论是：一个产生快乐或不安的对象，但与我们自己或他人没有任何联系，可能会使性情发生这样的转变，以至于它可能自然地陷入骄傲或爱，谦卑或仇恨，并寻找其他对象，通过双重关系，它可以找到这些情感。但是，一个只有其中一种关系的对象，尽管是最有利的关系，也永远不会引起任何恒定的和既定的激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Most fortunately all this reasoning is found to be exactly conformable to experience, and the phenomena of the passions. Suppose I were travelling with a companion thro' a country, to which we are both utter strangers; 'tis evident, that if the prospects be beautiful, the roads agreeable, and the inns commodious, this may put me into good humour both with myself and fellow-traveller. But as we suppose, that this country has no relation either to myself or friend, it can never be the immediate cause of pride or love; and therefore if I found not the passion on some other object, that bears either of us a closer relation, my emotions are rather to be consider'd as the overflowings of an elevate or humane disposition, than as an establish'd passion. The case is the same where the object produces uneasiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">最幸运的是，所有这些推理都与经验和激情现象完全相符。假设我和一个同伴在一个我们都完全陌生的国家旅行；很明显，如果前景美丽，道路顺畅，旅馆舒适，这可能会使我对自己和同伴都产生好感。但我们假设，这个国家与我本人或朋友都没有关系，它不可能成为骄傲或爱的直接原因；因此，如果我没有在其他与我们有更密切关系的对象上发现这种激情，我的情感宁愿被视为一种高尚或人道的性格的溢出，而不是一种既定的激情。在对象产生不安的情况下，情况也是如此。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Fourth Experiment. Having found, that neither an object without any relation of ideas or impressions, nor an object, that has only one relation, can ever cause pride or humility, love or hatred; reason alone may convince us, without any farther experiment, that whatever has a double relation must necessarily excite these passions; since 'tis evident they must have some cause. But to leave as little room for doubt as possible, let us renew our experiments, and see whether the event in this case answers our expectation. I choose an object, such as virtue, that causes a separate satisfaction: On this object I bestow a relation to self; and find, that from this disposition of affairs, there immediately arises a passion. But what passion? That very one of pride, to which this object bears a double relation. Its idea is related to that of self; the object of the passion: The sensation it causes resembles the sensation of the passion. That I may be sure I am not mistaken in this experiment, I remove first one relation; then another; and find, that each removal destroys the passion, and leaves the object perfectly indifferent. But I am not content with this. I make a still farther trial; and instead of removing the relation, I only change it for one of a different kind. I suppose the virtue to belong to my companion, not to myself; and observe what follows from this alteration. I immediately perceive the affections to wheel about, and leaving pride, where there is only one relation, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> of impressions, fall to the side of love, where they are attracted by a double relation of impressions and ideas. By repeating the same experiment, in changing anew the relation of ideas, I bring the affections back to pride; and by a new repetition I again place them at love or kindness. Being fully convinc'd of the influence of this relation, I try the effects of the other; and by changing virtue for vice, convert the pleasant impression, which arises from the former, into the disagreeable one, which proceeds from the latter. The effect still answers expectation. Vice, when plac'd on another, excites, by means of its double relations, the passion of hatred, instead of love, which for the same reason arises from virtue. To continue the experiment, I change anew the relation of ideas, and suppose the vice to belong to myself. What follows? What is usual. A subsequent change of the passion from hatred to humility. This humility I convert into pride by a new change of the impression; and find after all that I have compleated the round, and have by these changes brought back the passion to that very situation, in which I first found it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第四次实验。我们发现，无论是没有任何观念或印象关系的物体，还是只有一种关系的物体，都不可能引起骄傲或谦卑、爱或恨；仅凭理性就可以使我们相信，无需进一步的实验，凡是有双重关系的东西都必然会激起这些激情；因为很明显，它们必须有某种原因。但是，为了尽可能少地留下怀疑的余地，让我们重新进行实验，看看在这种情况下的事件是否符合我们的期望。我选择一个对象，比如说美德，它能引起一种单独的满足。在这个对象上，我赋予了与自我的关系；并且发现，从这种事务的处置中，立即产生了一种激情。但什么激情呢？就是那个骄傲的激情，这个对象与它有双重关系。它的观念与自我的观念有关；激情的对象。它所引起的感觉与激情的感觉相类似。为了确定我在这个实验中没有出错，我先去掉一个关系，然后再去掉另一个关系；结果发现，每次去掉都会破坏激情，而使对象完全无动于衷。但我并不满足于此。我又做了一个进一步的试验；我没有去掉关系，而只是把它换成另一种关系。我假定这种美德属于我的同伴，而不是属于我自己；观察一下这种改变的结果是什么。我立即意识到情感在转动，离开了只有一种关系（<i class="calibre10">即</i>印象）的骄傲，落到了爱的一边，在那里它们被印象和观念的双重关系所吸引。通过重复同样的实验，重新改变观念的关系，我把情感带回了骄傲；通过新的重复，我又把它们放在了爱或仁慈上。在充分确信这种关系的影响后，我又尝试另一种关系的影响；通过把美德换成恶习，把前者产生的愉快印象转换成后者产生的不愉快印象。其效果仍然符合人们的期望。恶行在另一个人身上时，通过它的双重关系，激起了仇恨的激情，而不是爱，因为同样的原因，爱是由美德产生的。为了继续这个实验，我重新改变观念的关系，并假设恶行属于我自己。接下来是什么？通常是这样的。随后，激情从憎恨变成了谦卑。这种谦卑我又通过新的印象变化转化为骄傲；最后我发现我已经完成了一轮，并通过这些变化把激情带回了我最初发现它时的那种情况。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But to make the matter still more certain, I alter the object; and instead of vice and virtue, make the trial upon beauty and deformity, riches and poverty, power and servitude. Each of these objects runs the circle of the passions in the same manner, by a change of their relations: And in whatever order we proceed, whether thro' pride, love, hatred, humility, or thro' humility, hatred, love, pride, the experiment is not in the least diversify'd. Esteem and contempt, indeed, arise on some occasions instead of love and hatred; but these are at the bottom the same passions, only diversify'd by some causes, which we shall explain afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但为了使事情更加确定，我改变了对象；不以罪恶和美德为对象，而以美貌和畸形、财富和贫穷、权力和奴役为对象进行试验。这些对象中的每一个都以同样的方式在激情的圈子里运行，通过改变它们的关系。无论我们按什么顺序进行，无论是通过骄傲、爱、仇恨、谦卑，还是通过谦卑、仇恨、爱、骄傲，试验都不会有丝毫的变化。尊敬和蔑视确实在某些情况下取代了爱和恨；但这些在本质上是相同的激情，只是由于某些原因而变得不同，这一点我们将在后面解释。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Fifth Experiment. To give greater authority to these experiments, let us change the situation of affairs as much as possible, and place the passions and objects in all the different positions, of which they are susceptible. Let us suppose, beside the relations above-mention'd, that the person, along with whom I make all these experiments, is closely connected with me either by blood or friendship. He is, we shall suppose, my son or brother, or is united to me by a long and familiar acquaintance. Let us next suppose, that the cause of the passion acquires a double relation of impressions and ideas to this person; and let us see what the effects are of all these complicated attractions and relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第五次实验。为了使这些实验具有更大的权威性，让我们尽可能地改变事务的状况，并将激情和对象置于它们容易受到影响的所有不同位置。让我们假设，除了上面提到的关系外，与我一起做所有这些实验的人，因血缘或友谊而与我有密切联系。我们将假设他是我的儿子或兄弟，或者因长期熟悉而与我结合在一起。接下来，让我们假设，激情的原因与这个人获得了印象和想法的双重关系；让我们看看所有这些复杂的吸引力和关系会产生什么效果。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Before we consider what they are in fact, let us determine what they ought to be, conformable to my hypothesis. 'Tis plain, that, according as the impression is either pleasant or uneasy, the passion of love or hatred must arise towards the person, who is thus connected to the cause of the impression by these double relations, which I have all along requir'd. The virtue of a brother must make me love him; as his vice or infamy must excite the contrary passion. But to judge only from the situation of affairs, I shou'd not expect, that the affections wou'd rest there, and never transfuse themselves into any other impression. As there is here a person, who by means of a double relation is the object of my passion, the very same reasoning leads me to think the passion will be carry'd farther. The person has a relation of ideas to myself, according to the supposition; the passion, of which he is the object, by being either agreeable or uneasy, has a relation of impressions to pride or humility. 'Tis evident, then, that one of these passions must arise from the love or hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们考虑它们实际上是什么之前，让我们确定它们应该是什么，以符合我的假设。很明显，根据印象的愉快或不愉快，必须对这个人产生爱或恨的激情，这个人通过这些双重关系与印象的原因联系在一起，这是我一直要求的。兄弟的美德必须使我爱他；正如他的恶行或恶名必须激起相反的激情。但仅从事情的情况来看，我不应该期望感情会停留在那里，而永远不会转化为其他的印象。由于这里有一个人，他通过双重关系成为我激情的对象，同样的推理使我认为这种激情将被带得更远。根据这个假设，这个人与我有一种观念上的关系；他作为对象的激情，由于顺眼或不顺眼，与骄傲或谦逊有一种印象上的关系。那么，很明显，这些激情中的一个必须来自爱或恨。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This is the reasoning I form in conformity to my hypothesis; and am pleas'd to find upon trial that every thing answers exactly to my expectation. The virtue or vice of a son or brother not only excites love or hatred, but by a new transition, from similar causes, gives rise to pride or humility. Nothing causes greater vanity than any shining quality in our relations; as nothing mortifies us more than their vice or infamy. This exact conformity of experience to our reasoning is a convincing proof of the solidity of that hypothesis, upon which we reason.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是我按照我的假设所做的推理；我很高兴地发现，经过试验，每件事情都完全符合我的期望。儿子或兄弟的美德或恶习不仅会激起爱或恨，而且通过一个新的过渡，从类似的原因，引起骄傲或谦逊。没有什么比我们关系中的任何光辉品质更能引起我们的虚荣心；也没有什么比他们的罪恶或耻辱更能使我们感到羞愧。经验与我们的推理的这种完全一致，是我们推理所依据的那个假设的坚实性的一个令人信服的证明。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Sixth Experiment. This evidence will be still augmented, if we reverse the experiment, and preserving still the same relations, begin only with a different passion. Suppose, that instead of the virtue or vice of a son or brother, which causes first love or hatred, and afterwards pride or humility, we place these good or bad qualities on ourselves, without any immediate connexion with the person, who is related to us: Experience shews us, that by this change of situation the whole chain is broke, and that the mind is not convey'd from one passion to another, as in the preceding instance. We never love or hate a son or brother for the virtue or vice we discern in ourselves; tho' 'tis evident the same qualities in him give us a very sensible pride or humility. The transition from pride or humility to love or hatred is not so natural as from love or hatred to pride or humility. This may at first sight be esteem'd contrary to my hypothesis; since the relations of impressions and ideas are in both cases precisely the same. Pride and humility are impressions related to love and hatred. Myself am related to the person. It shou'd, therefore, be expected, that like causes must produce like effects, and a perfect transition arise from the double relation, as in all other cases. This difficulty we may easily solve by the following reelections.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">第六次实验。如果我们把实验倒过来，仍然保持同样的关系，只是从不同的激情开始，那么这个证据就会进一步扩大。假设，我们把这些好的或坏的品质放在我们自己身上，而不是儿子或兄弟的美德或恶习（首先引起爱或恨，然后引起骄傲或谦卑），而与我们有关系的人没有任何直接联系。经验告诉我们，由于这种情况的变化，整个链条被打破了，心灵不会像前面的例子那样从一种激情转移到另一种激情。我们从来不会因为我们在自己身上发现的美德或恶习而爱或恨一个儿子或兄弟；尽管很明显，他身上同样的品质给了我们非常明显的骄傲或谦逊。从骄傲或谦卑到爱或恨的转变并不像从爱或恨到骄傲或谦卑那么自然。乍一看，这可能与我的假设相悖；因为印象和观念的关系在这两种情况下是完全一样的。骄傲和谦逊是与爱和恨有关的印象。我自己是与人有关的。因此，我们应该想到，相似的原因必须产生相似的结果，并且从双重关系中产生一个完美的过渡，就像在所有其他情况下一样。这个难题我们可以通过以下的重新选择来轻松解决。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident, that as we are at all times intimately conscious of ourselves, our sentiments and passions, their ideas must strike upon us with greater vivacity than the ideas of the sentiments and passions of any other person. But every thing, that strikes upon us with vivacity, and appears in a full and strong light, forces itself, in a manner, into our consideration, and becomes present to the mind on the smallest hint and most trivial relation. For the same reason when it is once present, it engages the attention, and keeps it from wandering to other objects, however strong may be their relation to our first object. The imagination passes easily from obscure to lively ideas, but with difficulty from lively to obscure. In the one case the relation is aided by another principle: In the other case, 'tis oppos'd by it. Now I have observ'd, that those two faculties of the mind, the imagination and passions, assist each other in their operation, when their propensities are similar, and when they act upon the same object. The mind has always a propensity to pass from a passion to any other related to it; and this propensity is forwarded when the object of the one passion is related to that of the other. The two impulses concur with each other, and render the whole transition more smooth and easy. But if it shou'd happen, that while the relation of ideas, strictly speaking, continues the same, its influence, in causing a transition of the imagination, shou'd no longer take place, 'tis evident its influence on the passions must also cease, as being dependent entirely on that transition. This is the reason why pride or humility is not transfus'd into love or hatred with the same ease, that the latter passions are chang'd into the former. If a person be my brother I am his likewise: But tho' the relations be reciprocal, they have very different effects on the imagination. The passage is smooth and open from the consideration of any person related to us to that of ourself, of whom we are every moment conscious. But when the affections are once directed to ourself, the fancy passes not with the same facility from that object to any other person, how closely so ever connected with us. This easy or difficult transition of the imagination operates upon the passions, and facilitates or retards their transition; which is a clear proof, that these two faculties of the passions and imagination are connected together, and that the relations of ideas have an influence upon the affections. Besides innumerable experiments that prove this, we here find, that even when the relation remains; if by any particular circumstance its usual effect upon the fancy in producing an association or transition of ideas, is prevented; its usual effect upon the passions, in conveying us from one to another, is in like manner prevented.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">显而易见，由于我们随时都在密切地意识到我们自己、我们的情感和激情，他们的想法必须比任何其他人的情感和激情的想法更生动地冲击我们。但是，每件事情，只要是以生动的方式冲击着我们，并以充分和强烈的光线出现，就会以某种方式迫使自己进入我们的考虑，并在最小的暗示和最微不足道的关系上出现在头脑中。出于同样的原因，当它一旦出现，就会吸引人们的注意力，使其不至于游离于其他对象，无论它们与我们的第一个对象有多大关系。想象力很容易从朦胧的想法变成生动的想法，但很难从生动的想法变成朦胧的想法。在一种情况下，这种关系得到另一个原则的帮助：在另一种情况下，这种关系被它所反对。现在我已经观察到，心灵的这两种能力，即想象力和激情，在它们的倾向性相似时，在它们作用于同一对象时，是相互协助的。心灵总是有一种倾向，即从一种激情转向与之相关的任何其他激情；当一种激情的对象与另一种激情的对象相关时，这种倾向就会被推动。这两种冲动相互配合，使整个过渡过程更加顺利和容易。但是，如果发生了这样的情况，即严格地说，虽然观念的关系继续保持不变，但它在引起想象力的过渡方面的影响不再发生，那么很明显，它对激情的影响也必须停止，因为它完全依赖于这种过渡。这就是为什么骄傲或谦卑不能像爱或恨那样轻松地转化为爱或恨的原因，因为后者的激情可以转化为前者。如果一个人是我的兄弟，我同样也是他的兄弟。但是，尽管这种关系是相互的，它们对想象力的影响却非常不同。从考虑任何与我们有关的人到考虑我们自己，这个过程是顺利和开放的，我们每时每刻都在意识到自己的存在。但是，当情感一旦指向我们自己时，想象力就不会以同样的方式从这个对象转移到任何其他人身上，无论他们与我们有多么密切的联系。想象力的这种轻松或困难的转换作用于激情，并促进或延缓它们的转换；这清楚地证明，激情和想象力这两种能力是联系在一起的，而且思想的关系对情感有影响。除了无数的实验证明了这一点，我们在这里发现，即使关系仍然存在，如果由于任何特定的情况，它对想象力产生联想或过渡的通常效果被阻止了，它对激情的通常效果，在把我们从一个传递到另一个方面，也以同样的方式被阻止。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Some may, perhaps, find a contradiction betwixt this phænomenon and that of sympathy, where the mind passes easily from the idea of ourselves to that of any other object related to us. But this difficulty will vanish, if we consider that in sympathy our own person is not the object of any passion, nor is there any thing, that fixes our attention on ourselves; as in the present case, where we are suppos'd to be actuated with pride or humility. Ourself, independent of the perception of every other object, is in reality nothing: For which reason we must tum our view to external objects; and 'tis natural for us to consider with most attention such as lie contiguous to us, or resemble us. But when self is the object of a passion, 'tis not natural to quit the consideration of it, till the passion be exhausted; in which case the double relations of impressions and ideas can no longer operate.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">也许有人会认为这种现象与同情现象之间存在矛盾，在同情现象中，人们的思想很容易从对自己的想法转移到与我们有关的任何其他对象上。但是，如果我们考虑到在同情中，我们自己并不是任何激情的对象，也没有任何东西使我们的注意力固定在自己身上；就像在目前的情况下，我们被认为是出于骄傲或谦卑的动机，那么这种困难就会消失。因此，我们必须将我们的视线集中在外部物体上；我们很自然地考虑与我们相邻或与我们相似的物体。但是，当自己是一种激情的对象时，在激情耗尽之前，放弃对它的考虑是不自然的；在这种情况下，印象和观念的双重关系就不能再发挥作用了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Seventh Experiment. To put this whole reasoning to a farther trial, let us make a new experiment; and as we have already seen the effects of related passions and ideas, let us here suppose an identity of passions along with a relation of ideas; and let us consider the effects of this new situation. ’Tis evident a transition of the passions from the one object to the other is here in all reason to be expected; since the relation of ideas is suppos'd still to continue, and an identity of impressions must produce a stronger connexion, than the most perfect resemblance, that can be imagin'd. If a double relation, therefore, of impressions and ideas is able to produce a transition from one to the other, much more an identity of impressions with a relation of ideas. Accordingly we find, that when we either love or hate any person, the passions seldom continue within their first bounds; but extend themselves towards all the contiguous objects, and comprehend the friends and relations of him we love or hate. Nothing is more natural than to bear a kindness to one brother on account of our friendship for another, without any farther examination of his character. A quarrel with one person gives us a hatred for the whole family, tho' entirely innocent of that, which displeases us. Instances of this kind are every where to be met with.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第七次实验。为了进一步检验这整个推理，让我们做一个新的实验；由于我们已经看到了相关的激情和观念的影响，让我们在这里假设激情的同一性和观念的关系；让我们考虑这一新情况的影响。显然，在这里，激情从一个对象过渡到另一个对象是完全可以预期的；因为观念的关系被认为仍在继续，而印象的同一性必须产生比最完美的相似性更强的联系，这是可以想象的。因此，如果印象和观念的双重关系能够产生从一个到另一个的过渡，那么印象与观念关系的同一性就更强了。因此，我们发现，当我们爱或恨任何一个人时，激情很少持续在其最初的范围内；而是延伸到所有邻近的对象，并包括我们爱或恨的人的朋友和关系。最自然的事情莫过于因为我们对另一个人的友谊而对一个兄弟抱有善意，而不对他的性格作进一步的审查。与一个人的争吵使我们对整个家庭产生了憎恨，尽管这完全是无辜的，这使我们感到不高兴。这样的例子随处可见。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is only one difficulty in this experiment, which it will be necessary to account for, before we proceed any farther. 'Tis evident, that tho' all passions pass easily from one object to another related to it, yet this transition is made with greater facility, where the more considerable object is first presented, and the lesser follows it, than where this order is revers'd, and the lesser takes the precedence. Thus 'tis more natural for us to love the son upon account of the father, than the father upon account of the son; the servant for the master, than the master for the servant; the subject for the prince, than the prince for the subject. In like manner we more readily contract a hatred against a whole family, where our first quarrel is with the head of it, than where we are displeas'd with a son, or servant, or some inferior member. In short, our passions, like other objects, descend with greater facility than they ascend.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这个实验中，只有一个困难，在我们进一步讨论之前，有必要解释一下。很明显，尽管所有的激情都很容易从一个对象转移到与之相关的另一个对象上，但是，在先出现较重要的对象，而后出现较次要的对象的情况下，这种转换会更容易进行，而在这种顺序被颠倒的情况下，较次要的对象占了先。因此，我们因父亲而爱儿子，比因儿子而爱父亲更自然；仆人爱主人，比主人爱仆人更自然；臣民爱王子，比王子爱臣民更自然。同样地，我们更容易对整个家庭产生仇恨，如果我们的第一场争吵是针对家庭的首脑，而不是针对一个儿子、仆人或一些低级成员的不满。简而言之，我们的激情就像其他物体一样，下降的速度比上升的速度更快。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That we may comprehend, wherein consists the difficulty of explaining this phænomenon, we must consider, that the very same reason, which determines the imagination to pass from remote to contiguous objects, with more facility than from contiguous to remote, causes it likewise to change with more ease, the less for the greater, than the greater for the less. Whatever has the greatest influence is most taken notice of; and whatever is most taken notice of, presents itself most readily to the imagination. We are more apt to over-look in any subject, what is trivial, than what appears of considerable moment; but especially if the latter takes the precedence, and first engages our attention. Thus if any accident makes us consider the <i class="calibre10">Satellites</i> of <i class="calibre10">Jupiter</i>, our fancy is naturally determin'd to form the idea of that planet; but if we first reflect on the principal planet, 'tis more natural for us to overlook its attendants. The mention of the provinces of any empire conveys our thought to the seat of the empire; but the fancy returns not with the same facility to the consideration of the provinces. The idea of the servant makes us think of the master; that of the subject carries our view to the prince. But the same relation has not an equal influence in conveying us back again. And on this is founded that reproach of <i class="calibre10">Cornelia</i> to her sons, that they ought to be asham'd she shou'd be more known by the title of the daughter of <i class="calibre10">Scorpio</i>, than by that of the mother of the <i class="calibre10">Gracchi</i> This was, in other words, exhorting them to render themselves as illustrious and famous as their grandfather, otherwise the imagination of the people, passing from her who was intermediate, and plac'd in an equal relation to both, wou'd always leave them, and denominate her by what was more considerable and of greater moment. On the same principle is founded that common custom of making wives bear the name of their husbands, rather than husbands that of their wives; as also the ceremony of giving the precedence to those, whom we honour and respect. We might find many other instances to confirm this principle, were it not already sufficiently evident.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了让我们理解解释这一现象的困难所在，我们必须考虑到，决定想象力从遥远的物体到相邻的物体，比从相邻的物体到遥远的物体更方便的同样原因，也导致它同样更容易地以小换大，而不是以大换小。凡是影响最大的东西都会被注意到；凡是被注意到的东西，都最容易被想象力发现。在任何问题上，我们更容易忽略那些微不足道的东西，而不是那些看起来相当重要的东西；但特别是如果后者占了先机，首先吸引了我们的注意力。因此，如果有什么意外让我们考虑<i class="calibre10">木星</i>的<i class="calibre10">卫星</i>，我们的想象力就会自然而然地形成对那颗行星的想法；但如果我们首先考虑的是主行星，我们就会更自然地忽略它的附属物。提到任何一个帝国的省份，我们的思想就会转到帝国的所在地；但想象力不会以同样的方式回到对省份的考虑上。仆人的概念使我们想到主人；臣民的概念把我们的视线带到王子身上。但同样的关系在把我们带回去方面却没有同样的影响力。<i class="calibre10">科妮莉亚</i>对她的儿子们的责备就是基于此，她说他们应该为她以<i class="calibre10">天蝎座</i>的女儿的头衔而不是<i class="calibre10">格拉基的</i>母亲的头衔而感到羞愧。换句话说，这是在劝说他们使自己像他们的祖父一样杰出和著名，否则人们的想象力就会从处于中间位置的她身上转移开来，并将她置于与两者平等的关系中，而总是离开他们，用更重要和更有意义的东西来称谓她。基于同样的原则，通常的习俗是让妻子冠以丈夫的名字，而不是让丈夫冠以妻子的名字；同样的，也是让那些我们尊敬的人享有优先权的仪式。我们可以找到许多其他的例子来证实这个原则，如果它还不够明显的话。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now since the fancy finds the same facility in passing from the lesser to the greater, as from remote to contiguous, why does not this easy transition of ideas assist the transition of passions in the former case, as well as in the latter? The virtues of a friend or brother produce first love, and then pride; because in that case the imagination passes from remote to contiguous, according to its propensity. Our own virtues produce not first pride, and then love to a friend or brother; because the passage in that case wou'd be from contiguous to remote, contrary to its propensity. But the love or hatred of an inferior causes not readily any passion to the superior, tho' that be the natural propensity of the imagination: While the love or hatred of a superior, causes a passion to the inferior, contrary to its propensity. In short, the same facility of transition operates not in the same manner upon superior and inferior as upon contiguous and remote. These two phenomena appear contradictory, and require some attention to be reconcil'd.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然想象力在从小到大，从远到近的过程中找到了同样的便利，为什么在前者和后者的情况下，这种思想的轻松转换不有助于激情的转换呢？朋友或兄弟的美德首先产生了爱，然后是骄傲；因为在这种情况下，想象力根据其倾向性从遥远的地方转到邻近的地方。我们自己的美德不会先产生骄傲，然后对朋友或兄弟产生爱；因为在这种情况下，想象力会从相邻到相距，与它的倾向相反。但对下级的爱或恨不会轻易引起对上级的任何激情，尽管那是想象力的自然倾向。而对上级的爱或恨则会使下级产生激情，这与它的倾向相反。简而言之，同样的转换机制在上级和下级之间的运作方式与在相邻和相距之间的运作方式不一样。这两种现象似乎是相互矛盾的，需要注意加以调和。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As the transition of ideas is here made contrary to the natural propensity of the imagination, that faculty must be overpower'd by some stronger principle of another kind; and as there is nothing ever present to the mind but impressions and ideas, this principle must necessarily lie in the impressions. Now it has been observ'd, that impressions or passions are connected only by their resemblance, and that where any two passions place the mind in the same or in similar dispositions, it very naturally passes from the one to the other: As on the contrary, a repugnance in the dispositions produces a difficulty in the transition of the passions. But 'tis observable, that this repugnance may arise from a deference of degree as well as of kind, nor do we experience a greater difficulty in passing suddenly from a small degree of love to a small degree of hatred, than from a small to a great degree of either of these affections. A man, when calm or only moderately agitated, is so different, in every respect, from himself, when disturbed with a violent passion, that no two persons can be more unlike; nor is it easy to pass from the one extreme to the other, without a considerable interval betwixt them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由于观念的转变在这里违背了想象力的自然倾向，所以这种能力必须被另一种更强有力的原则所压制；由于头脑中除了印象和观念之外没有任何东西存在，这种原则必然在印象中。现在人们已经注意到，印象或激情只是通过它们的相似性联系在一起，当任何两种激情使心灵处于相同或相似的倾向时，它很自然地从一个转向另一个。相反，如果倾向上有分歧，就会给激情的转换带来困难。但可以看到，这种抵触可能来自于程度和种类的不同，我们从小程度的爱突然转向小程度的恨，也不会比从这两种情感的小程度转向大程度更困难。一个人在平静或只是适度激动的时候，在各方面都与他自己有很大的不同，当他被剧烈的激情所扰时，没有两个人是更不一样的；从一个极端到另一个极端也不容易，中间没有相当的间隔。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The difficulty is not less, if it be not rather greater, in passing from the strong passion to the weak, than in passing from the weak to the strong, provided the one passion upon its appearance destroys the other, and they do not both of them exist at once. But the case is entirely alter'd, when the passions unite together, and actuate the mind at the same time. A weak passion, when added to a strong, makes not so considerable change in the disposition, as a strong when added to a weak; for which reason there is a closer connexion betwixt the great degree and the small, than betwixt the small degree and the great.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从强势的激情转到弱势的激情，其难度不比从弱势转到强势的激情小，甚至更大，只要一种激情一出现就会摧毁另一种激情，而且它们不是同时存在。但是，当两种激情结合在一起，并同时作用于心灵时，情况就完全不同了。弱的激情加到强的激情上时，不会像强的激情加到弱的激情上时那样使人的性情发生相当大的变化；因此，大度和小度之间的联系比小度和大度之间的联系更为密切。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The degree of any passion depends upon the nature of its object; and an affection directed to a person, who is considerable in our eyes, fills and possesses the mind much more than one, which has for its object a person we esteem of less consequence. Here then the contradiction betwixt the propensities of the imagination and passion displays itse1f. When we turn our thought to a great and a small object, the imagination finds more facility in passing from the small to the great, than from the great to the small; but the affections find a greater difficulty: And as the affections area more powerful principle than the imagination, no wonder they prevail over it, and draw the mind to their side. In spite of the difficulty of passing from the idea of great to that of little, a passion directed to the former, produces always a similar passion towards the latter; when the great and little are related together. The idea of the servant conveys our thought most readily to the master; but the hatred or love of the master produces with greater facility anger or good-will to the servant. The strongest passion in this case takes the precedence; and the addition of the weaker making no considerable change on the disposition, the passage is by that means render'd more easy and natural betwixt them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">任何激情的程度都取决于其对象的性质；对一个在我们眼里很重要的人的感情，要比对一个我们认为不太重要的人的感情更充实和占有心灵。因此，想象力和激情之间的矛盾就在这里显示出来了。当我们把思想转向一个大的和一个小的对象时，想象力发现从小的到大的，比从大的到小的更方便；但情感却发现更困难。由于情感的原则比想象力更强大，难怪它们会胜过想象力，并把思想吸引到它们身边。尽管从大的概念到小的概念有困难，但当大的和小的联系在一起时，对前者的热情总是对后者产生类似的热情。仆人的想法最容易将我们的思想传达给主人；但对主人的憎恨或爱，却更容易产生对仆人的愤怒或善意。在这种情况下，最强烈的激情占了上风；加上较弱的激情，对性情没有什么改变，因此，他们之间的关系就变得更加容易和自然。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As in the foregoing experiment we found, that a relation of ideas, which, by any particular circumstance, ceases to produce its usual effect of facilitating the transition of ideas, ceases likewise to operate on the passions; so in the present experiment we find the same property of the impressions. Two different degrees of the same passion are surely related together; but if the smaller be first present, it has little or no tendency to introduce the greater; and that because the addition of the great to the little, produces a more sensible alteration on the temper, than the addition of the little to the great. These phænomena, when duly weigh'd, will be found convincing proofs of this hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">正如我们在前面的实验中发现，一种观念的关系，如果在任何特定的情况下，不再产生促进观念转换的通常效果，也就不再对激情起作用；所以在本实验中，我们发现了印象的同样特性。同一种激情的两个不同程度肯定是联系在一起的；但如果小的首先出现，它就没有或很少有引入大的趋势；这是因为大的加入小的，比小的加入大的，对脾气产生更明显的改变。这些现象，如果经过适当的权衡，就会发现是这个假设的有力证明。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">And these proofs will be confirm'd, if we consider the manner in which the mind here reconciles the contradiction, I have observ'd betwixt the passions and the imagination. The fancy passes with more facility from the less to the greater, than from the greater to the less: But on the contrary a violent passion produces more easily a feeble, than that does a violent. In this opposition the passion in the end prevails over the imagination; but 'tis commonly by complying with it, and by seeking another quality, which may counter-ballance that principle, from whence the opposition arises. When we love the father or master of a family, we little think of his children or servants. But when these are present with us, or when it lies any ways in our power to serve them, the nearness and contiguity in this case encreases their magnitude, or at least removes that opposition, which the fancy makes to the transition of the affections. If the imagination finds a difficulty in passing from greater to less, it finds an equal facility in passing from remote to contiguous, which brings the matter to an equality, and leaves the way open from the one passion to the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我们考虑一下心灵在这里调和矛盾的方式，就会证实这些证据，我已经观察到激情和想象力之间的矛盾。想象力从小到大，比从大到小，更容易通过。但相反地，剧烈的激情比剧烈的激情更容易产生虚弱的感觉。在这种对立中，激情最终战胜了想象力；但通常是通过顺应它，并通过寻求另一种质量来抵消这一原则，这就是对立产生的原因。当我们爱一个家庭的父亲或主人时，我们很少想到他的孩子或仆人。但是，当这些人和我们在一起时，或者当我们有能力为他们服务时，在这种情况下，接近和相邻的关系增加了他们的重要性，或者至少消除了那种反对，这是幻想对情感的过渡所造成的。如果想象力在从大到小的过程中发现了困难，那么它在从遥远到相邻的过程中也发现了同样的便利，这就使事情变得平等，并使从一种激情到另一种激情的道路畅通。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Eighth Experiment. I have observ'd that the transition from love or hatred to pride or humility, is more easy than from pride or humility to love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in passing from contiguous to remote, is the cause why we scarce have any instance of the latter transition of the affections. I must, however, make one exception, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> when the very cause of the pride and humility is plac'd in some other person. For in that case the imagination is necessitated to consider the person, nor can it possibly confine its view to ourselves. Thus nothing more readily produces kindness and affection to any person, than his approbation of our conduct and character: As on the other hand, nothing inspires us with a stronger hatred, than his blame or contempt. Here 'tis evident, that the original passion is pride or humility, whose object is self; and that this passion is transfus'd into love or hatred, whose object is some other person, notwithstanding the rule I have already establish'd, <i class="calibre10">that the imagination passes with difficulty from contiguous to remote</i>. But the transition in this case is not made merely on account of the relation betwixt ourselves and the person; but because that very person is the real cause of our first passion, and of consequence is intimately connected with it. 'Tis his approbation that produces pride; and disapprobation, humility. No wonder, then, the imagination returns back again attended with the related passions of love and hatred. This is not a contradiction, but an exception to the rule; and an exception that arises from the same reason with the rule itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第八次实验。我注意到，从爱或恨过渡到骄傲或谦卑，比从骄傲或谦卑过渡到爱或恨更容易；想象力在从相邻到相距的过程中发现的困难，是我们很少有感情过渡的例子的原因。然而，我必须提出一个例外，<i class="calibre10">即当</i>造成骄傲和谦卑的原因是在另一个人身上。因为在这种情况下，想象力必须考虑这个人，它也不可能把它的视野局限在我们自己身上。因此，没有什么比他对我们的行为和性格的赞许更容易产生对任何人的善意和爱戴。另一方面，没有什么比他的指责或蔑视更能激发我们的憎恨了。这里很明显，最初的激情是骄傲或谦卑，其对象是自己；这种激情转化为爱或恨，其对象是另一个人，尽管我已经确立了一个规则，<i class="calibre10">即想象力很难从相邻的地方转移到远方</i>。但在这种情况下，这种转变并不仅仅是由于我们和那个人之间的关系；而是因为那个人是我们最初激情的真正原因，因此与它密切相关。他的赞许产生了骄傲，而不赞许产生了谦卑。因此，难怪想象力会带着爱和恨的相关激情再次回来。这不是矛盾，而是规则的一个例外；而这个例外是由规则本身的相同原因产生的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Such an exception as this is, therefore, rather a confirmation of the rule. And indeed, if we consider all the eight experiments I have explain'd, we shall find that the same principle appears in all of them, and that 'tis by means of a transition arising from a double relation of impressions and ideas, pride humility, love and hatred are produc'd. An object without <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-331" id="calibre_link-411" title="54">54</a></sup>a relation, or <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-332" id="calibre_link-457" title="55">55</a></sup>with but one, never produces either of these passions; and 'tis <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-333" id="calibre_link-13" title="56">56</a></sup>found that the passion always varies in conformity to the relation. Nay we may observe, that where the relation, by any particular circumstance, has not its usual effect of producing a transition either of <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-334" id="calibre_link-390" title="57">57</a></sup>ideas or of impressions, it ceases to operate upon the passions, and gives rise neither to pride nor love, humility nor hatred. This rule we find still to hold good<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-335" id="calibre_link-148" title="58">58</a></sup>, even under the appearance of its contrary; and as relation is frequently experience'd to have no effect; which upon examination is found to proceed from some particular circumstance, that prevents the transition; so even in instances, where that circumstance, tho' present, prevents not the transition, 'tis found to arise from some other circumstance, which counterbalances it. Thus not only the variations resolve themselves into the general principle, but even the variations of these variations.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，这样的一个例外反而是对规则的确认。事实上，如果我们考虑一下我所解释的所有八个实验，我们会发现同样的原理出现在所有的实验中，而且是通过印象和观念的双重关系所产生的过渡，产生了骄傲、谦逊、爱和恨。一个没有 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-331" id="calibre_link-411" title="54">54</a></sup>关系，或 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-332" id="calibre_link-457" title="55">55</a></sup>没有关系的物体，或者只有一种关系的物体，永远不会产生这些激情中的任何一种；而且我们发现 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-333" id="calibre_link-13" title="56">56</a></sup>我们发现，这种激情总是随着关系的变化而变化。此外，我们还可以看到，如果这种关系在任何特定的情况下，没有产生观念或印象的过渡的通常效果，那么它就会停止。 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-334" id="calibre_link-390" title="57">57</a></sup>观念或印象的转变，它就不再对激情起作用，既不产生骄傲也不产生爱，既不产生谦卑也不产生仇恨。我们发现这一规则仍然有效<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-335" id="calibre_link-148" title="58">58</a></sup>我们发现，即使在与之相反的情况下，这一规则仍然有效；而且，正如人们经常经历的没有效果的关系一样，经过检查发现，这种关系是由阻止过渡的某种特殊情况引起的；因此，即使在这种情况下，虽然存在这种情况，但并没有阻止过渡，也会发现是由其他情况引起的，而这种情况与之相抵消。因此，不仅是变异的情况会转化为一般原则，甚至是这些变异的变异。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more evident, than that any person acquires our kindness, or is expos'd to our ill-will, in proportion to the pleasure or uneasiness we receive from him, and that the passions keep pace exactly with the sensations in all their changes and variations. Whoever can find the means either by his services, his beauty, or his flattery, to render himself useful or agreeable to us, is sure of our affections: As on the other hand, whoever harms or displeases us never fails to excite our anger or hatred. When our own nation is at war with any other, we detest them under the character of cruel, perfidious, unjust and violent: But always esteem ourselves and allies equitable, moderate, and merciful. If the general of our enemies be successful, 'tis with difficulty we allow him the figure and character of a man. He is a sorcerer: He has a communication with dæmons; as is reported of <i class="calibre10">Oliver Cromwell</i> and the <i class="calibre10">Duke of Luxembourg:</i> He is bloody minded, and takes a pleasure in death and destruction. But if the success be on our side, our commander has all the opposite good qualities, and is a pattern of virtue, as well as of courage and conduct. His treachery we call policy: His cruelty is an evil inseparable from war. In short, every one of his faults we either endeavour to extenuate, or dignify it with the name of that virtue, which approaches it. 'Tis evident the same method of thinking runs thro' common life.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">最明显的是，任何人获得我们的好感，或受到我们的恶感，都与我们从他那里得到的快乐或不快成正比，而且激情与感觉的所有变化完全同步。谁能通过他的服务、他的美貌或他的奉承找到办法，使自己对我们有用或令人满意，谁就能保证得到我们的爱戴。另一方面，凡是伤害我们或使我们不快的人，都会激起我们的愤怒或仇恨。当我们自己的国家与其他国家交战时，我们憎恨他们，认为他们残忍、背信弃义、不公正和暴力：但我们总是认为自己和盟友是公平、温和和仁慈的。如果我们的敌人的将军成功了，我们很难允许他有人的形象和性格。他是个巫师：他与魔鬼有联系；正如<i class="calibre10">奥利弗-克伦威尔</i>和<i class="calibre10">卢森堡公爵</i>的报道<i class="calibre10">：</i>他有血腥的头脑，以死亡和毁灭为乐。但是，如果成功在我们这边，我们的指挥官就具有所有相反的优良品质，而且是美德的典范，也是勇气和行为的典范。他的背叛行为我们称之为政策。他的残忍是与战争不可分割的罪恶。总而言之，他的每一个缺点我们都尽力去减轻，或者用接近它的美德的名字来庄重其事。很明显，同样的思维方式贯穿了普通人的生活。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There are some, who add another condition, and require not only that the pain and pleasure arise from the person, but likewise that it arise knowingly, and with a particular design and intention. A man, who wounds and harms us by accident, becomes not our enemy upon that account, nor do we think ourselves bound by any ties of gratitude to one, who does us any service after the same manner. By the intention we judge of the actions, and according as that is good or bad, they become causes of love or hatred.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But here we must make a distinction. If that quality in another, which pleases or displeases, be constant and inherent in his person and character, it will cause love or hatred independent of the intention: But otherwise a knowledge and design is requisite, in order to give rise to these passions. One that is disagreeable by his deformity or folly is the object of our aversion, tho' nothing be more certain, than that he has not the least intention of displeasing us by these qualities. But if the uneasiness proceed not from a quality, but an action, which is produc'd and annihilated in a moment, 'tis necessary, in order to produce some relation, and connect this action sufficiently with the person, that it be deriv'd from a particular fore-thought and design. 'Tis not enough, that the action arise from the person, and have him for its immediate cause and author. This relation alone is too feeble and inconstant to be a foundation for these passions. It reaches not the sensible and thinking part, and neither proceeds from any thing <i class="calibre10">durable</i> in him, nor leaves any thing behind it; but passes in a moment, and is as if it had never been. On the other hand, an intention shews certain qualities, which remaining after the action is perform'd, connect it with the person, and facilitate the transition of ideas from one to the other. We can never think of him without reflecting on these qualities; unless repentance and a change of life have produc'd an alteration in that respect: In which case the passion is likewise alter'd. This therefore is one reason, why an intention is requisite to excite either love or hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但在这里我们必须做出区分。如果另一个人身上让人高兴或不高兴的品质在他的人和性格中是恒定的和固有的，那么它将引起爱或恨，与意图无关。但否则，为了引起这些激情，就必须有一个知识和设计。一个因其畸形或愚蠢而令人不快的人是我们厌恶的对象，尽管没有什么比他丝毫没有因这些品质而使我们不快的意图更确定了。但是，如果不安不是来自于一种品质，而是一种行动，这种行动在瞬间产生并消失，那么为了产生某种关系，并将这种行动与人充分联系起来，就有必要让它来自于一种特殊的预想和设计。仅仅是行动来自于人，并以他为直接原因和作者是不够的。仅仅是这种关系就太脆弱和不稳定了，不能成为这些激情的基础。它没有达到理智和思考的部分，既不是从他身上任何<i class="calibre10">持久的</i>东西出发，也没有留下任何东西；而是在一瞬间就过去了，就像它从未出现过一样。另一方面，一个意图显示了某些品质，这些品质在行动完成后仍然存在，将其与人联系起来，并促进思想从一个过渡到另一个。除非悔改和生活的改变导致了这方面的改变，否则我们在想到他的时候永远不会不考虑这些品质。在这种情况下，激情也会随之改变。因此，这就是一个原因，为什么需要有一个意图来激发爱或恨。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But we must farther consider, that an intention, besides its strengthening the relation of ideas, is often necessary to produce a relation of impressions, and give rise to pleasure and uneasiness. For 'tis observable, that the principal part of an injury is the contempt and hatred, which it shews in the person, that injures us; and without that, the mere harm gives us a less sensible uneasiness. In like manner, a good office is agreeable, chiefly because it flatters our vanity, and is a proof of the kindness and esteem of the person, who performs it. The removal of the intention, removes the mortification in the one case, and vanity in the other; and must of course cause a remarkable diminution in the passions of love and hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但我们必须进一步考虑，意图除了加强观念的关系外，往往还需要产生印象的关系，并引起快乐和不安。因为我们可以看到，伤害的主要部分是对伤害我们的人的蔑视和憎恨；如果没有这一点，单纯的伤害就会给我们带来不太明显的不安。同样地，一个好的工作是令人愉快的，主要是因为它满足了我们的虚荣心，并证明了执行工作的人的仁慈和尊敬。意图的消除，在一种情况下消除了羞辱，在另一种情况下消除了虚荣心；当然也会使爱和恨的激情明显减少。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I grant, that these effects of the removal of design, in diminishing the relations of impressions and ideas, are not entire, nor able to remove every degree of these relations. But then I ask, if the removal of design be able entirely to remove the passion of love and hatred? Experience, I am sure, informs us of the contrary, nor is there any thing more certain, than that men often fall into a violent anger for injuries, which they themselves must own to be entirely involuntary and accidental. This emotion, indeed, cannot be of long continuance; but still is sufficient to shew, that there is a natural connexion betwixt uneasiness and anger, and that the relation of impressions will operate upon a very small relation of ideas. But when the violence of the impression is once a little abated, the defect of the relation begins to be better felt; and as the character of a person is no wise interested in such injuries as are casual and involuntary, it seldom happens that on their account, we entertain a lasting enmity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我承认，消除设计的这些效果，在减少印象和观念的关系方面，并不完全，也不能消除这些关系的每一种程度。但我要问的是，设计的消除是否能够完全消除爱与恨的激情？我相信，经验告诉我们，情况恰恰相反，也没有什么比人们经常因为受到伤害而陷入剧烈的愤怒更确定的事情了，他们自己必须承认，这种愤怒完全是不由自主的和偶然的。这种情绪确实不可能长期持续；但仍足以说明，不安和愤怒之间有一种自然的联系，印象的关系将作用于非常小的观念关系。但是，当印象的暴力一旦稍稍减弱，这种关系的缺陷就会开始被更好地感受到；由于一个人的性格对这种偶然和非自愿的伤害并不感兴趣，所以很少会因为它们而产生持久的敌意。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate this doctrine by a parallel instance, we may observe, that not only the uneasiness, which proceeds from another by accident, has but little force to excite our passion, but also that which arises from an acknowledge'd necessity and duty. One that has a real design of harming us, proceeding not from hatred and ill-will, but from justice and equity, draws not upon him our anger, if we be in any degree reasonable; notwithstanding he is both the cause, and the knowing cause of our sufferings. Let us examine a little this phænomenon.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了用一个平行的例子来说明这个学说，我们可以看到，不仅从另一个人那里偶然产生的不安没有什么力量来激起我们的激情，而且从公认的必要性和责任产生的不安也没有什么力量。一个真正想伤害我们的人，不是出于仇恨和恶意，而是出于正义和公平，如果我们在任何程度上是合理的，就不会引来我们的愤怒；尽管他既是我们痛苦的原因，也是明知的原因。让我们稍微研究一下这个现象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis evident in the first place, that this circumstance is not decisive; and tho' it may be able to diminish the passions, 'tis seldom it can entirely remove them. How few criminals are there, who have no ill-will to the person, that accuses them, or to the judge, that condemns them, even tho' they be conscious of their own deserts? In like manner our antagonist in a law-suit, and our competitor for any office, are commonly regarded as our enemies, tho' we must acknowledge, if we wou'd but reflect a moment, that their motive is entirely as justifiable as our own.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">首先很明显，这种情况不是决定性的；尽管它可能会减少激情，但很少能完全消除它们。有多少罪犯对指控他们的人或谴责他们的法官没有恶意，即使他们意识到了自己的罪过？同样，我们在诉讼中的对手，以及我们在任何职位上的竞争者，通常被视为我们的敌人，尽管我们必须承认，如果我们稍加思考，他们的动机完全和我们的动机一样合理。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Besides we may consider, that when we receive harm from any person, we are apt to imagine him criminal, and 'tis with extreme difficulty we allow of his justice and innocence. This is a clear proof, that, independent of the opinion of iniquity, any harm or uneasiness has a natural tendency to excite our hatred, and that afterwards we seek for reasons upon which we may justify and establish the passion. Here the idea of injury produces not the passion, but arises from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，我们可以考虑，当我们受到任何人的伤害时，我们很容易想象他是罪犯，而我们却很难接受他的正义和清白。这是一个明显的证据，表明在不公正的观点之外，任何伤害或不安都有一种自然的倾向，会激起我们的仇恨，之后我们会寻找理由，以证明我们的激情是合理的。在这里，伤害的想法不是产生了激情，而是由它产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor is it any wonder that passion should produce the opinion of injury; since otherwise it must suffer a considerable diminution, which all the passions avoid as much as possible. The removal of injury may remove the anger, without proving that the anger arises only from the injury. The harm and the justice are two contrary objects, of which the one has a tendency to produce hatred, and the other love; and 'tis according to their different degrees, and our particular tum of thinking, that either of the objects prevails, and excites its proper passion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">激情产生对伤害的看法也不足为奇；因为否则它必须遭受相当大的削弱，而所有的激情都尽可能地避免这种削弱。伤害的消除可以消除愤怒，但不能证明愤怒仅仅来自伤害。伤害和正义是两个相反的对象，其中一个有产生仇恨的倾向，另一个有产生爱的倾向；根据它们的不同程度，以及我们特定的思维方式，其中一个对象占了上风，并激发了其适当的激情。</p></div>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在给出了一个理由之后，为什么一些引起真正快乐或不安的行为，并没有在任何程度上，或只是在很小的程度上，激起对行为者的爱或恨的激情；'这就有必要说明，许多物体的快乐或不安是在哪里产生的，我们通过经验发现这些物体会产生这些激情。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">According to the preceding system there is always requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas betwixt the cause and effect, in order to produce either love or hatred. But tho' this be universally true, 'tis remarkable that the passion of love may be excited by only one <i class="calibre10">relation</i> of a different kind, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> betwixt ourselves and the object; or more properly speaking, that this relation is always attended with both the others. Whoever is united to us by any connexion is always sure of a share of our love, proportion'd to the connexion, without enquiring into his other qualities. Thus the relation of blood produces the strongest tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children, and a lesser degree of the same affection, as the relation lessens. Nor has consanguinity alone this effect, but any other relation without exception. We love our country-men, our neighbours, those of the same trade, profession, and even name with ourselves. Every one of these relations is esteemed some tie, and gives a title to a share of our affection.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">根据前面的体系，在原因和结果之间总是需要有印象和观念的双重关系，以便产生爱或恨。但是，尽管这是普遍的事实，值得注意的是，爱的激情可能只被一种不同的<i class="calibre10">关系</i>所激发，<i class="calibre10">即</i>我们和对象之间的关系；或者更恰当地说，这种关系总是伴随着其他两种关系。凡是通过任何关系与我们结合在一起的人，总能保证得到我们的一份爱，与这种关系成正比，而不需要询问他的其他品质。因此，在父母对子女的爱中，血缘关系会产生心灵上最强烈的联系，而随着血缘关系的减弱，同样的感情也会减弱。也不仅仅是血缘关系有这种作用，任何其他关系都不例外。我们爱我们的同胞，我们的邻居，那些与我们同行业、同职业、甚至同名的人。这些关系中的每一个都被认为是某种联系，都有资格获得我们的一份感情。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Those, who take a pleasure in declaiming against human nature, have observ'd, that man is altogether insufficient to support himself; and that when you loosen all the holds, which he has of external objects, he immediately drops down into the deepest melancholy and despair. From this, say they, proceeds that continual search after amusement in gaming, in hunting, in business; by which we endeavour to forget ourselves, and excite our spirits from the languid state, into which they fall, when not sustain'd by some brisk and lively emotion. To this method of thinking I so far agree, that I own the mind to be insufficient, of itself, to its own entertainment, and that it naturally seeks after foreign objects, which may produce a lively sensation, and agitate the spirits. On the appearance of such an object it awakes, as it were, from a dream: The blood flows with a new tide: The heart is elevated: And the whole man acquires a vigour, which he cannot command in his solitary and calm moments. Hence company is naturally so rejoicing, as presenting the liveliest of all objects, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> a rational and thinking Being like ourselves, who communicates to us all the actions of his mind; makes us privy to his inmost sentiments and affections; and lets us see, in the very instant of their production, all the emotions, which are caus'd by any object.

Whatever is related to us is conceiv'd in a lively manner by the easy transition from ourselves to the related object. Custom also, or acquaintance facilitates the entrance, and strengthens the conception of any object. The first case is parallel to our reasoning's from cause and effect; the second to education. And as reasoning and education concur only in producing a lively and strong idea of any object; so is this the only particular, which is common to relation and acquaintance. This must, therefore, be the influencing quality, by which they produce all their common effects; and love or kindness being one of these effects, it must be from the force and liveliness of conception, that the passion is deriv'd. Such a conception is peculiarly agreeable, and makes us have an affectionate regard for every thing, that produces it, when the proper object of kindness and good-will.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The idea of ourselves is always intimately present to us, and conveys a sensible degree of vivacity to the idea of any other object, to which we are related. This lively idea changes by degrees into a real impression; these two kinds of perception being in a great measure the same, and differing only in their degrees of force and vivacity. But this change must be produc'd with the greater ease, that our natural temper gives us a propensity to the same impression, which we observe in others, and makes it arise upon any slight occasion. In that case resemblance converts the idea into an impression, not only by means of the relation, and by transfusing the original vivacity into the related idea; but also by presenting such materials as take fire from the least spark. And as in both cases a love or affection arises from the resemblance, we may learn that a sympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion to the spirits, since an easy sympathy and correspondent emotions are alone common to <i class="calibre10">relation</i>, <i class="calibre10">acquaintance</i>, and <i class="calibre10">resemblance</i>.</p>

It often happens, that after we have liv'd a considerable time in any city; however at first it might be disagreeable to us; yet as we become familiar with the objects, and contract an acquaintance, tho’ merely with the streets and buildings, the aversion diminishes by degrees, and at last changes into the opposite passion. The mind finds a satisfaction and ease in the view of objects, to which it is accustom'd, and naturally prefers them to others, which, tho', perhaps, in themselves more valuable, are less known to it. By the same quality of the mind we are seduc'd into a good opinion of ourselves, and of all objects, that belong to us.

'Tis easy to remark in common life, that children esteem their relation to their mother to be weaken'd, in a great measure, by her second marriage, and no longer regard her with the same eye, as if she had continu'd in her state of widow-hood. Nor does this happen only, when they have felt any inconveniences from her second marriage, or when her husband is much her inferior; but even without any of these considerations, and merely because she has become part of another family. This also takes place with regard to the second marriage of a father; but in a much less degree: And 'tis certain the ties of blood are not so much loosen'd in the latter case as by the marriage of a mother.

		<p class="block_6 en">In order to produce a perfect relation betwixt two objects, ’tis requisite, not only that the imagination be convey'd from one to the other by resemblance, contiguity or causation, but also that it return back from the second to the first with the same ease and facility. At first sight this may seem a necessary and unavoidable consequence. If one object resemble another, the latter object must necessarily resemble the former. If one object be the cause of another, the second object is effect to its cause. 'Tis the same case with contiguity: And therefore the relation being always reciprocal, it maybe thought, that the return of the imagination from the second to the first must also, in every case, be equally natural as its passage from the first to the second. But upon farther examination we shall easily discover our mistake. For supposing the second object, beside its reciprocal relation to the first, to have also a strong relation to a third object; in that case the thought, passing from the first object to the second, returns not back with the same facility, tho' the relation continues the same; but is readily carry'd on to the third object, by means of the new relation, which presents itself, and gives a new impulse to the imagination. This new relation, therefore, weakens the tie betwixt the first and second objects. The fancy is by its very nature wavering and inconstant; and considers always two objects as more strongly related together, where it finds the passage equally easy both in going and returning, than where the transition is easy only in one of these motions. The double motion is a kind of a double tie, and binds the objects together in the closest and most intimate manner.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了在两个物体之间产生完美的关系，不仅需要想象力通过相似性、相邻性或因果关系从一个物体传递到另一个物体，而且还需要想象力以同样的轻松和便利从第二个物体返回到第一个物体。乍一看，这似乎是一个必要的和不可避免的结果。如果一个物体与另一个物体相似，后一个物体必然与前一个物体相似。如果一个物体是另一个物体的原因，那么第二个物体就是其原因的结果。毗连性的情况也是如此。因此，由于这种关系总是相互的，人们可能会认为，想象力从第二个物体回到第一个物体，在任何情况下都必须与它从第一个物体到第二个物体一样自然。但经过进一步的研究，我们会很容易发现我们的错误。因为假设第二个物体除了与第一个物体的相互关系外，还与第三个物体有很强的关系；在这种情况下，思想从第一个物体到第二个物体，虽然关系继续保持不变，但不会以同样的方式返回；而是很容易被带到第三个物体，通过新的关系，它呈现出来，给想象力带来新的推动力。因此，这种新的关系削弱了第一个和第二个物体之间的联系。想象力在本质上是飘忽不定的；它认为两个物体总是更紧密地联系在一起，在那里它发现去和回的通道都同样容易，而在那里只有其中一个运动容易过渡。双重运动是一种双重纽带，它以最紧密和最亲密的方式将两个物体捆绑在一起。</p></div>

But after the imagination is arriv'd at this point of view, it finds its object to be surrounded with so many other relations, which challenge its regard, that it knows not which to prefer, and is at a loss what new object to pitch upon. The ties of interest and duty bind her to another family, and prevent that return of the fancy from her to myself, which is necessary to support the union. The thought has no longer the vibration, requisite to set it perfectly at ease, and indulge its inclination to change.

When my imagination goes from myself to my father, it passes not so readily from him to his second wife, nor considers him as entering into a different family, but as continuing the head of that family, of which I am myself a part. His superiority prevents the easy transition of the thought from him to his spouse, but keeps the passage still open for a return to myself along the same relation of child and parent. He is not sunk in the new relation he acquires; so that the double motion or vibration of thought is still easy and natural.

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis certain, that the first principle, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the reflection on agreeable objects, has a greater influence, than what, at first sight, we may be apt to imagine. We seldom reflect on what is beautiful or ugly, agreeable or disagreeable, without an emotion of pleasure or uneasiness; and tho' these sensations appear not much in our common indolent way of thinking, 'tis easy, either in reading or conversation, to discover them. Men of wit always turn the discourse on subjects that are entertaining to the imagination; and poets never present any objects but such as are of the same nature. Mr. <i class="calibre10">Phillips</i> has chosen <i class="calibre10">Cyder</i> for the subject of an excellent poem. Beer wou'd not have been so proper, as being neither so agreeable to the taste nor eye. But he wou'd certainly have preferr'd wine to either of them, cou'd his native country have afforded him so agreeable a liquor. We may learn from thence, that every thing, which is agreeable to the senses, is also in some measure agreeable to the fancy, and conveys to the thought an image of that satisfaction, which it gives by its real application to the bodily organs.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">可以肯定的是，第一个原则，<i class="calibre10">即</i>对令人满意的物体的反思，比我们乍看之下可能容易想象的影响更大。我们很少思考什么是美或丑，什么是顺眼或不顺眼，而不产生快乐或不安的情绪；虽然这些感觉在我们通常懒散的思维方式中并不多见，但在阅读或交谈中，很容易发现它们。有智慧的人总是把话语转到对想象力有帮助的主题上；而诗人从来没有介绍过任何对象，只有那些具有同样性质的对象。<i class="calibre10">菲利普斯</i>先生选择了<i class="calibre10">Cyder</i>作为一首优秀诗歌的主题。如果是啤酒就不太合适了，因为它既不符合人们的口味，也不符合人们的眼睛。但如果他的祖国能提供给他这么好的酒，他肯定会喜欢葡萄酒而不是它们中的任何一种。从这里我们可以了解到，凡是对感官有利的东西，在某种程度上也是对想象力有利的，并向思想传达一种满足感，而这种满足感是通过它对身体器官的实际应用而产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' these reasons may induce us to comprehend this delicacy of the imagination among the causes of the respect, which we pay the rich and powerful, there are many other reasons, that may keep us from regarding it as the sole or principal. For as the ideas of pleasure can have an influence only by means of their vivacity, which makes them approach impressions, 'tis most natural those ideas shou'd have that influence, which are favour'd by most circumstances, and have a natural tendency to become strong and lively; such our ideas of the passions and sensations of any human creature. Every human creature resembles ourselves, and by that means has an advantage above any other object, in operating on the imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管这些原因可能促使我们把想象力的这种微妙性理解为我们对富人和权贵的尊重的原因之一，但还有许多其他原因，可能使我们不把它视为唯一或主要的原因。因为快乐的观念只有通过它们的活力才能产生影响，这使它们接近于印象，所以最自然的是那些受到大多数情况的青睐，并有自然倾向于变得强大和活泼的观念应该有这种影响；我们对任何人类生物的激情和感觉的观念就是这样。每一个人类生物都与我们自己相似，因此，在对想象力的影响方面，我们比任何其他物体都有优势。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Besides, if we consider the nature of that faculty, and the great influence which all relations have upon it, we shall easily be persuaded, that however the ideas of the pleasant wines, music, or gardens, which the rich man enjoys, may become lively and agreeable, the fancy will not confine itself to them, but will carry its view to the related objects; and in particular, to the person, who possesses them. And this is the more natural, that the pleasant idea or image produces here a passion towards the person, by means of his relation to the object; so that 'tis unavoidable but he must enter into the original conception, since he makes the object of the derivative passion. But if he enters into the original conception, and is consider'd as enjoying these agreeable objects, ’tis <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i> which is properly the cause of the affection; and the <i class="calibre10">third</i> principle is more powerful and universal than the <i class="calibre10">first</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，如果我们考虑到这种能力的性质，以及所有关系对它的巨大影响，我们就会很容易被说服，无论富人所享受的愉快的葡萄酒、音乐或花园的想法如何变得生动和令人愉快，想象力都不会局限于它们，而是会把它的观点带到相关的物体上；特别是拥有它们的人。这就更自然了，因为愉快的想法或形象在这里产生了对人的激情，通过他与对象的关系；所以，他必须进入原始概念，这是不可避免的，因为他成为衍生激情的对象。但是，如果他进入原始概念，并被认为是在享受这些令人愉快的对象，那么<i class="calibre10">同情心</i>才是这种感情的正确原因；<i class="calibre10">第三种</i>原则比<i class="calibre10">第一种</i>原则更强大、更普遍。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Add to this, that riches and power alone, even tho' unemploy'd, naturally cause esteem and respect: And consequently these passions arise not from the idea of any beautiful or agreeable objects. 'Tis true; money implies a kind of representation of such objects, by the power it affords of obtaining them; and for that reason may still be esteem'd proper to convey those agreeable images, which may give rise to the passion. But as this prospect is very distant, 'tis more natural for us to take a contiguous object, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the satisfaction, which this power affords the person, who is possest of it. And of this we shall be farther satisfy'd, if we consider, that riches represent the goods of life, only by means of the will; which employs them; and therefore imply in their very nature an idea of the person, and cannot be consider'd without a kind of sympathy with his sensations and enjoyments.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">此外，只有财富和权力，即使没有使用，也自然会引起人们的尊敬和尊重。因此，这些激情并不是从任何美丽或令人愉快的物体的想法中产生的。这倒是真的；金钱意味着对这些物品的一种表述，因为它提供了获得这些物品的权力；因此，人们仍然认为它适合于传达那些令人愉快的形象，而这些形象可能引起激情。但由于这个前景非常遥远，我们更自然地采取一个相邻的目标，<i class="calibre10">即</i>这种能力给拥有它的人带来的满足。如果我们考虑到，财富只是通过意志来代表生活中的物品，而意志是使用它们的；因此，在它们的本质上意味着对人的想法，如果不与他的感觉和享受产生共鸣，就不能考虑这一点。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This we may confirm by a reflection, which to some will, perhaps, appear too subtile and refin'd. I have already observ'd, that power, as distinguish'd from its exercise, has either no meaning at all, or is nothing but a possibility or probability of existence; by which any object approaches to reality, and has a sensible influence on the mind. I have also observ'd, that this approach, by an illusion of the fancy, appears much greater, when we ourselves are possest of the power, than when it is enjoy'd by another; and that in the former case the objects seem to touch upon the very verge of reality, and convey almost an equal satisfaction, as if actually in our possession. Now I assert, that where we esteem a person upon account of his riches, we must enter into this sentiment of the proprietor, and that without such a sympathy the idea of the agreeable objects, which they give him the power to produce, wou'd have but a feeble influence upon us. An avaricious man is respected for his money, tho' he scarce is possest of a <i class="calibre10">power</i>; that is, there scarce is a <i class="calibre10">probability</i> or even <i class="calibre10">possibility</i> of his employing it in the acquisition of the pleasures and conveniences of life. To himself alone this power seems perfect and entire; and therefore we must receive his sentiments by sympathy, before we can have a strong intense idea of these enjoyments, or esteem him upon account of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们可以通过一个思考来证实这一点，也许对某些人来说，这个思考会显得过于微妙和精炼了。我已经注意到，权力与权力的行使相区别，要么根本没有意义，要么只是一种存在的可能性或可能性；通过这种可能性或可能性，任何物体都会接近现实，并对心灵产生明显的影响。我还注意到，这种通过幻想的接近，在我们自己拥有这种能力的时候，比在别人享有这种能力的时候要大得多；在前一种情况下，物体似乎触及到了现实的边缘，并传达了几乎同样的满足感，就像我们实际拥有的一样。现在我断言，当我们因为一个人的财富而尊重他时，我们必须对所有者产生这种情感，如果没有这种同情心，那么他所生产的令人愉快的物品的概念对我们的影响将是微弱的。一个贪婪的人因其金钱而受到尊重，尽管他很少拥有<i class="calibre10">权力</i>；也就是说，他很少有<i class="calibre10">可能</i>或甚至不<i class="calibre10">可能</i>利用金钱来获得生活的乐趣和便利。只有他自己认为这种能力是完美的、完整的；因此，我们必须通过同情来接受他的情感，然后才能对这些享受产生强烈的想法，或者因为这些享受而对他产生敬意。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis obvious, that tho' riches and authority undoubtedly give their owner a power of doing us service, yet this power is not to be consider'd as on the same footing with that, which they afford him, of pleasing himself and satisfying his own appetites. Self-love approaches the power and exercise very near each other in the latter case; but in order to produce a similar effect in the former, we must suppose a friendship and good-will to be conjoin'd with the riches. Without that circumstance ’tis difficult to conceive on what we can found our hope of advantage from the riches of others, tho' there is nothing more certain, than that we naturally esteem and respect the rich, even before we discover in them any such favourable disposition towards us.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，尽管财富和权力无疑给了他们的主人一种为我们服务的权力，但这种权力不能被视为与他们提供给他的取悦自己和满足自己的欲望的权力处于同一地位。在后一种情况下，自爱的力量和作用非常接近；但为了在前一种情况下产生类似的效果，我们必须假设友谊和善意与财富结合在一起。如果没有这种情况，就很难想象我们能从别人的财富中找到我们的希望，尽管没有什么比我们自然地尊敬和尊重富人，甚至在我们发现他们对我们有任何这种有利的倾向之前，更肯定的了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But I carry this farther, and observe, not only that we respect the rich and powerful, where they shew no inclination to serve us, but also when we lie so much out of the sphere of their activity, that they cannot even be suppos'd to be endow'd with that power. Prisoners of war are always treated with a respect suitable to their condition; and 'tis certain riches go very far towards fixing the condition of any person. If birth and quality enter for a share, this still affords us an argument of the same kind. For what is it we call a man of birth, but one who is descended from a long succession of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires our esteem by his relation to persons whom we esteem? His ancestors, therefore, tho' dead, are respected, in some measure, on account of their riches, and consequently without any kind of expectation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但我想说的是，我们不仅要尊重富人和权贵，在他们不愿意为我们服务的情况下，还要尊重我们在他们活动范围之外的地方，甚至不能认为他们被赋予了这种权力。战俘总是受到与其处境相称的尊重；可以肯定的是，财富在很大程度上决定了任何人的处境。如果出身和品质也有份，这仍然为我们提供了一个相同的论据。因为我们所说的有血缘关系的人，不过是一个由富有和强大的祖先长期继承下来的人，他通过与我们所尊敬的人的关系获得我们的尊敬？因此，他的祖先虽然已经去世，但在某种程度上，由于他们的财富而受到尊重，因此没有任何期望。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But not to go so far as prisoners of war and the dead to find instances of this disinterested esteem for riches, let us observe with a little attention those phenomena that occur to us in common life and conversation. A man, who is himself of a competent fortune, upon coming into a company of strangers, naturally treats them with different degrees of respect and deference, as he is inform'd of their different fortunes and conditions; tho' 'tis impossible he can ever propose, and perhaps wou'd not accept of any advantage from them. A traveller is always admitted into company, and meets with civility, in proportion as his train and equipage speak him a man of great or moderate fortune. In short, the different ranks of men are, in a great measure, regulated by riches, and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors, strangers as well as acquaintance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，我们不要到战俘和死者身上去寻找这种对财富的无私尊重的例子，让我们稍微注意观察一下我们在普通生活和谈话中出现的那些现象。一个人，如果他自己有足够的财富，当他来到一个陌生人的公司时，自然会以不同程度的尊重和敬意对待他们，因为他被告知他们不同的财富和条件；尽管他不可能提出，也许也不会接受他们的任何好处。一个旅行者总是被允许与人交往，并受到礼貌的对待，这与他的火车和装备说明他是个大富翁或中等富翁的比例有关。总之，人的不同等级在很大程度上是由财富决定的，而且是对上级和下级，对陌生人和熟人的关系。</p></div>

Riches give satisfaction to their possessor; and this satisfaction is convey'd to the beholder by the imagination, which produces an idea resembling the original impression in force and vivacity.

		<p class="block_6 en">The best method of reconciling us to this opinion is to take a general survey of the universe, and observe the force of sympathy thro' the whole animal creation, and the easy communication of sentiments from one thinking being to another. In all creatures, that prey not upon others, and are not agitated with violent passions, there appears a remarkable desire of company, which associates them together, without any advantages they can ever propose to reap from their union. This is still more conspicuous in man, as being the creature of the universe, who has the most ardent desire of society, and is fitted for it by the most advantages. We can form no wish, which has not a reference to society. A perfect solitude is, perhaps, the greatest punishment we can suffer. Every pleasure languishes when enjoy'd a-part from company, and every pain becomes more cruel and intolerable. Whatever other passions we may be actuated by; pride, ambition, avarice, curiosity, revenge or lust; the soul or animating principle of them all is sympathy; nor wou'd they have any force, were we to abstract entirely from the thoughts and sentiments of others. Let all the powers and elements of nature conspire to serve and obey one man: Let the sun rise and set at his command: The sea and rivers roll as he pleases, and the earth furnish spontaneously whatever may be useful or agreeable to him: He will still be miserable, till you give him some one person at least, with whom he may share his happiness, and whose esteem and friendship he may enjoy.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">要使我们同意这种观点，最好的办法是对宇宙进行一次全面的考察，观察整个动物界的同情力量，以及一个有思想的生物与另一个有思想的生物之间的情感交流的便利。在所有的生物中，只要不捕食他人，也不被剧烈的激情所激荡，就会出现一种显著的结伴欲望，使它们联系在一起，而它们并不打算从它们的结合中获得任何好处。这一点在人身上更为明显，因为人是宇宙中的生物，对社会有最强烈的渴望，也有最多的好处适合于它。我们不能形成任何不与社会相联系的愿望。完美的孤独也许是我们能承受的最大惩罚。在远离人群的情况下，每一种快乐都会枯竭，每一种痛苦都会变得更加残酷和难以忍受。无论我们被什么激情所驱使；骄傲、野心、贪婪、好奇、报复或欲望；它们的灵魂或激励原则都是同情；如果我们完全从他人的思想和情感中抽离出来，它们也不会有任何力量。让自然界的所有力量和元素合力为一个人服务并服从他。让太阳按照他的命令升起和落下。海水和河流随他的意愿翻滚，大地自发地提供任何对他有用或令人满意的东西。他仍然会很悲惨，除非你至少给他一个人，他可以和他分享他的幸福，他可以享受他的尊敬和友谊。</p></div>

Most kinds of beauty are deriv'd from this origin; and tho' our first object be some senseless inanimate piece of matter, 'tis seldom we rest there, and carry not our view to its influence on sensible and rational creatures. A man, who shews us any house or building, takes particular care among other things to point out the convenience of the apartments, the advantages of their situation, and the little room lost in the stairs, anti-chambers and passages; and indeed 'tis evident, the chief part of the beauty consists in these particulars. The observation of convenience gives pleasure, since convenience is a beauty. But after what manner does it give pleasure? 'Tis certain our own interest is not in the least concern'd; and as this is a beauty of interest, not of form, so to speak, it must delight us merely by communication, and by our sympathizing with the proprietor of the lodging.

But this is a beauty merely of imagination, and has no foundation in what appears to the senses.

Thus the pleasure, which a rich man receives from his possessions, being thrown upon the beholder, causes a pleasure and esteem; which sentiments again, being perceiv'd and sympathize'd with, encrease the pleasure of the possessor; and being once more reflected, become a new foundation for pleasure and esteem in the beholder. There is certainly an original satisfaction in riches deriv'd from that power, which they bestow, of enjoying all the pleasures of life; and as this is their very nature and essence, it must be the first source of all the passions, which arise from them. One of the most considerable of these passions is that of love or esteem in others, which therefore proceeds from a sympathy with the pleasure of the possessor. But the possessor has also a secondary satisfaction in riches arising from the love and esteem he acquires by them, and this satisfaction is nothing but a second reflexion of that original pleasure, which proceeded from himself. This secondary satisfaction or vanity becomes one of the principal recommendations of riches, and is the chief reason, why we either desire them for ourselves, or esteem them in others. Here then is a third rebound of the original pleasure; after which 'tis difficult to distinguish the images and reflexions, by reason of their faintness and confusion.</p>

Ideas never admit of a total union, but are endow'd with a kind of impenetrability, by which they exclude each other, and are capable of forming a compound by their conjunction, not by their mixture. On the other hand, impressions and passions are susceptible of an entire union; and like colours, may be blended so perfectly together, that each of them may lose itself, and contribute only to vary that uniform impression, which arises from the whole. Some of the most curious phænomena of the human mind are deriv'd from this property of the passions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In examining those ingredients, which are capable of uniting with love and hatred, I begin to be sensible, in some measure, of a misfortune, that has attended every system of philosophy, with which the world has been yet acquainted. 'Tis commonly found, that in accounting for the operations of nature by any particular hypothesis; among a number of experiments, that quadrate exactly with the principles we wou'd endeavour to establish; there is always some phænomenon, which is more stubborn, and will not so easily bend to our purpose. We need not be surpriz'd, that this shou'd happen in natural philosophy. The essence and composition of external bodies are so obscure, that we must necessarily, in our reasoning's, or rather conjectures conceding them, involve ourselves in contradictions and absurdities. But as the perceptions of the mind are perfectly known, and I have us'd all imaginable caution in forming conclusions conceding them, I have always hop'd to keep clear of those contradictions, which have attended every other system. Accordingly the difficulty, which I have at present in my eye, is no-wise contrary to my system; but only departs a little from that simplicity, which has been hitherto its principal force and beauty.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在研究那些能够与爱和恨结合在一起的成分时，我开始在某种程度上意识到一种不幸，这种不幸一直伴随着世界上已经熟悉的每个哲学体系。我们经常发现，在用任何特定的假设来解释自然界的运作时，在一些与我们试图建立的原则完全一致的实验中，总有一些现象比较顽固，不会那么容易屈服于我们的目的。我们不需要惊讶，这种情况会发生在自然哲学中。外部物体的本质和组成是如此模糊不清，以至于我们在推理中，或者说在承认它们的猜想中，必然要把自己卷入矛盾和荒谬之中。但是，由于心灵的感知是完全已知的，而且我在形成承认这些感知的结论时采取了所有可以想象到的谨慎态度，所以我总是希望能够避免那些矛盾，而这些矛盾在其他系统中都有。因此，我目前所看到的困难与我的体系并不相悖；而只是稍微偏离了迄今为止一直是其主要力量和优点的简单性。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The passions of love and hatred are always followed by, or rather conjoin'd with benevolence and anger. 'Tis this conjunction, which chiefly distinguishes these affections from pride and humility. For pride and humility are pure emotions in the soul, unattended with any desire, and not immediately exciting us to action. But love and hatred are not compleated within themselves, nor rest in that emotion, which they produce, but carry the mind to something farther. Love is always follow'd by a desire of the happiness of the person belov'd, and an aversion to his misery: As hatred produces a desire of the misery and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated. So remarkable a difference betwixt these two sets of passions of pride and humility, love and hatred, which in so many other particulars correspond to each other, merits our attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">爱和恨的激情总是紧随其后，或者说与仁慈和愤怒结合在一起。这种结合，是这些情感与骄傲和谦卑的主要区别。因为骄傲和谦卑是灵魂中纯粹的情感，没有任何欲望的伴随，也不会立即激发我们的行动。但是，爱和恨并不是在它们自己内部完成的，也不是停留在它们所产生的那种情感上，而是把思想带到更远的地方。爱总是伴随着对所爱之人的幸福的渴望和对其痛苦的厌恶。憎恨则产生对被恨者的痛苦的渴望和对其幸福的厌恶。傲慢与谦卑、爱与恨这两组激情之间存在着如此明显的差异，而这两组激情在其他许多方面都是相互对应的，因此值得我们注意。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The conjunction of this desire and aversion with love and hatred may be accounted for by two different hypotheses. The first is, that love and hatred have not only a <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, which excites them, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> pleasure and pain; and an <i class="calibre10">object</i>, to which they are directed, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> a person or thinking being; but likewise an <i class="calibre10">end</i>, which they endeavour to attain, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the happiness or misery of the person belov'd or hated; all which views, mixing together, make only one passion. According to this system, love is nothing but the desire of happiness to another person, and hatred that of misery. The desire and aversion constitute the very nature of love and hatred. They are not only inseparable but the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种欲望和厌恶与爱和恨的结合，可以通过两个不同的假设来解释。第一个假设是，爱和恨不仅有一个激发它们的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>，<i class="calibre10">即</i>快乐和痛苦；还有一个它们所指向的<i class="calibre10">对象</i>，<i class="calibre10">即</i>一个人或有思想的人；同样还有一个它们努力达到的<i class="calibre10">目的</i>，<i class="calibre10">即</i>所爱或所恨之人的幸福或痛苦；所有这些观点混合在一起，只构成一种激情。根据这一体系，爱只不过是对另一个人的幸福的渴望，而恨则是对痛苦的渴望。愿望和厌恶构成了爱和恨的本质。它们不仅是不可分割的，而且是相同的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But this is evidently contrary to experience. For tho' 'tis certain we never love any person without desiring his happiness, nor hate any without wishing his misery, yet these desires arise only upon the ideas of the happiness or misery of our friend or enemy being presented by the imagination, and are not absolutely essential to love and hatred. They are the most obvious and natural sentiments of these affections, but not the only ones. The passions may express themselves in a hundred ways, and may subsist a considerable time, without our reflecting on the happiness or misery of their objects; which clearly proves, that these desires are not the same with love and hatred, nor make any essential part of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但这显然是与经验相反的。因为尽管 "可以肯定的是，我们在爱一个人时不会不希望他幸福，在恨一个人时也不会不希望他痛苦，但这些欲望只是在我们的朋友或敌人的幸福或痛苦的想法由想象力呈现时才会产生，而不是爱和恨的绝对必要条件。它们是这些情感中最明显和最自然的情感，但不是唯一的情感。激情可以用一百种方式来表达自己，也可以存在相当长的时间，而不需要我们思考其对象的幸福或痛苦；这清楚地证明，这些欲望与爱和恨不一样，也不构成它们的任何基本部分。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">We may, therefore, infer, that benevolence and anger are passions different from love and hatred, and only conjoin'd with them, by the original constitution of the mind. As nature has given to the body certain appetites and inclinations, which she encreases, diminishes, or changes according to the situation of the fluids or solids; she has proceeded in the same manner with the mind. According as we are possess'd with love or hatred, the correspondent desire of the happiness or misery of the person, who is the object of these passions, arises in the mind, and varies with each variation of these opposite passions. This order of things, abstractedly consider'd, is not necessary. Love and hatred might have been unattended with any such desires, or their particular connexion might have been entirely revers'd. If nature had so pleas'd, love might have had the same effect as hatred, and hatred as love. I see no contradiction in supposing a desire of producing misery annex'd to love, and of happiness to hatred. If the sensation of the passion and desire be opposite, nature cou'd have alter'd the sensation without altering the tendency of the desire, and by that means made them compatible with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们可以推断，仁慈和愤怒是与爱和恨不同的激情，而且只是通过心灵的原始结构与它们结合在一起的。正如大自然赋予身体某些食欲和倾向，她根据液体或固体的情况增加、减少或改变这些食欲和倾向；她以同样的方式对待心灵。当我们被爱或恨所占据时，相应的对作为这些激情对象的人的幸福或痛苦的渴望就会在头脑中产生，并随着这些相反的激情的每一次变化而发生变化。抽象地考虑事物的这种顺序，是没有必要的。爱和恨可能没有任何这样的欲望，或者它们的特殊联系可能完全被取消了。如果自然界有这样的要求，爱可能与恨有同样的效果，恨也可能与爱有同样的效果。我认为，假设产生痛苦的欲望附属于爱，而幸福附属于恨，这并不矛盾。如果激情和欲望的感觉是相反的，自然可以在不改变欲望倾向的情况下改变这种感觉，并通过这种方式使它们相互兼容。</p></div>

We pity even strangers, and such as are perfectly indifferent to us: And if our ill-will to another proceed from any harm or injury, it is not, properly speaking, malice, but revenge.

		<p class="block_6 cn">从有关同情心的先例推理中，很容易解释怜悯的激情。我们对每一件与我们有关的事物都有一个生动的概念。所有的人类生物都与我们有相似之处。因此，他们的人，他们的利益，他们的激情，他们的痛苦和快乐必须以一种生动的方式冲击我们，并产生一种与原来相似的情绪；因为一个生动的想法很容易转化为一种印象。如果这在一般情况下是真实的，那么在苦难和悲伤方面一定是更加真实的。这些总是比任何快乐或享受有更强烈和更持久的诱因。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">A spectator of a tragedy passes thro' a long train of grief, terror, indignation, and other affections, which the poet represents in the persons he introduces. As many tragedies end happily, and no excellent one can be compos'd without some reverses of fortune, the spectator must sympathize with all these changes, and receive the fictitious joy as well as every other passion. Unless, therefore, it be asserted, that every distinct passion is communicated by a distinct original quality, and is not deriv'd from the general principle of sympathy above-explain'd, it must be allow'd, that all of them arise from that principle. To except any one in particular must appear highly unreasonable. As they are all first present in the mind of one person, and afterwards appear in the mind of another; and as the manner of their appearance, first as an idea, then as an impression, is in every case the same, the transition must arise from the same principle. I am at least sure, that this method of reasoning wou'd be consider'd as certain, either in natural philosophy or common life.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">欣赏悲剧的人要经历一长串的悲伤、恐怖、愤怒和其他情感，这些都是诗人在他所介绍的人身上所表现的。由于许多悲剧的结局都是幸福的，而且没有一部优秀的作品可以不经过一些命运的逆转，所以观众必须同情所有这些变化，并接受虚构的快乐以及其他各种激情。因此，除非有人断言，每一种不同的激情都是由一种不同的原始品质传达出来的，而不是从上面所解释的同情的一般原则中派生出来的，否则就必须承认，所有的激情都来自于这个原则。排除任何一个特别的东西，都会显得非常不合理。因为它们都是先出现在一个人的头脑中，然后再出现在另一个人的头脑中；而且它们出现的方式，先是作为一种观念，然后是作为一种印象，在每一种情况下都是一样的，这种转变必须来自同一个原则。我至少确信，无论是在自然哲学还是在普通生活中，这种推理方法都会被认为是确定的。</p></div>

Not to mention that women and children are most subject to pity, as being most guided by that faculty. The same infirmity, which makes them faint at the sight of a naked sword, tho' in the hands of their best friend, makes them pity extremely those, whom they find in any grief or addiction. Those philosophers, who derive this passion from I know not what subtile reflections on the instability of fortune, and our being liable to the same miseries we behold, will find this observation contrary to them among a great many others, which it were easy to produce.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There remains only to take notice of a pretty remarkable phænomenon of this passion; which is, that the communicated passion of sympathy sometimes acquires strength from the weakness of its original, and even arises by a transition from affections, which have no existence. Thus when a person obtains any honourable office, or inherits a great fortune, we are always the more rejoic'd for his prosperity, the less sense he seems to have of it, and the greater equanimity and indifference he shews in its enjoyment. In like manner a man, who is not dejected by misfortunes, is the more lamented on account of his patience; and if that virtue extends so far as utterly to remove all sense of uneasiness, it still farther encreases our compassion. When a person of merit falls into what is vulgarly esteem'd a great misfortune, we form a notion of his condition; and carrying our fancy from the cause to the usual effect, first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow, and then feel an impression of it, entirely overlooking that greatness of mind, which elevates him above such emotions, or only considering it so far as to encrease our admiration, love and tenderness for him. We find from experience, that such a degree of passion is usually connected with such a misfortune; and tho' there be an exception in the present case, yet the imagination is affected by the general rule, and makes us conceive a lively idea of the passion, or rather feel the passion itself; in the same manner, as if the person were really actuated by it. From the same principles we blush for the conduct of those, who behave themselves foolishly before us; and that tho' they shew no sense of shame, nor seem in the least conscious of their folly. All this proceeds from sympathy; but 'tis of a partial kind, and views its objects only on one side, without considering the other, which has a contrary effect, and wou'd entirely destroy that emotion, which arises from the first appearance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们只需注意到这种激情的一个相当显著的现象；那就是，同情的交流激情有时会从其原始的弱点中获得力量，甚至从不存在的情感中过渡而产生的。因此，当一个人获得任何光荣的职位，或继承一笔巨大的财富时，我们总是为他的繁荣感到高兴，他似乎对它的感觉越少，他在享受它时表现得越平静和冷漠。同样，一个人如果不因不幸而沮丧，就会因为他的忍耐而更加悲哀；如果这种美德延伸到完全消除所有的不安感，它还会进一步增加我们的同情心。当一个有价值的人陷入俗称的巨大不幸时，我们会对他的状况形成一个概念；并把我们的想象力从原因带到通常的结果，首先对他的悲伤有一个生动的概念，然后对它有一个印象，完全忽略了那种使他超越这种情绪的伟大心灵，或者只考虑到增加我们对他的钦佩、爱和温柔。我们从经验中发现，这种程度的激情通常与这种不幸有关；尽管在本案中存在例外，但想象力受到一般规则的影响，使我们对这种激情产生生动的想法，或者说感受到这种激情本身；以同样的方式，仿佛这个人真的被这种激情所驱动。出于同样的原则，我们为那些在我们面前表现愚蠢的人的行为感到羞愧；尽管他们没有表现出羞耻感，也似乎丝毫没有意识到自己的愚蠢。所有这些都来自于同情；但这种同情是片面的，它只看到它的对象的一面，而没有考虑到另一面，这有一个相反的效果，会完全破坏这种情感，这种情感产生于最初的外观。</p></div>

As we ourselves are here acquainted with the wretched situation of the person, it gives us a lively idea and sensation of sorrow, which is the passion that generally attends it; and this idea becomes still more lively, and the sensation more violent by a contrast with that security and indifference, which we observe in the person himself. A contrast of any kind never fails to affect the imagination, especially when presented by the subject; and 'tis on the imagination that pity entirely depends<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-318" id="calibre_link-386" title="59">59</a></sup>.</p>

When an object augments or diminishes to the eye or imagination from a comparison with others, the image and idea of the object are still the same, and are equally extended in the <i class="calibre10">retina</i>, and in the brain or organ of perception. The eyes refract the rays of light, and the optic nerves convey the images to the brain in the very same manner, whether a great or small object has preceded; nor does even the imagination alter the dimensions of its object on account of a comparison with others. The question then is, how from the same impression and the same idea we can form such different judgments concerning the same object, and at one time admire its bulk, and at another despise its littleness.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to explain this matter, I shall just touch upon two principles, one of which shall be more fully explain'd in the progress of this treatise; the other has been already accounted for. I believe it may safely be establish'd for a general maxim, that no object is presented to the senses, nor image form'd in the fancy, but what is accompany'd with some emotion or movement of spirits proportion'd to it; and however custom may make us insensible of this sensation, and cause us to confound it with the object or idea, 'twill be easy, by careful and exact experiments, to separate and distinguish them. For to instance only in the cases of extension and number; 'tis evident, that any very bulky object, such as the ocean, an extended plain, a vast chain of mountains, a wide forest; or any very numerous collection of objects, such as an army, a fleet, a crowd, excite in the mind a sensible emotion; and that the admiration, which arises on the appearance of such objects, is one of the most lively pleasures, which human nature is capable of enjoying. Now as this admiration encreases or diminishes by the encrease or diminution of the objects, we may conclude, according to our foregoing<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-453" title="60">60</a></sup> principles, that 'tis a compound effect, proceeding from the conjunction of the several effects, which arise from each part of the cause. Every part, then, of extension, and every unite of number has a separate emotion attending it, when conceiv'd by the mind; and tho' that emotion be not always agreeable, yet by its conjunction with others, and by its agitating the spirits to a just pitch, it contributes to the production of admiration, which is always agreeable. If this be allow'd with respect to extension and number, we can make no difficulty with respect to virtue and vice, wit and folly, riches and poverty, happiness and misery, and other objects of that kind, which are always attended with an evident emotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了解释这个问题，我只想谈谈两个原则，其中一个将在本论文的进展中得到更充分的解释；另一个已经说明了。我相信，可以有把握地确立一个普遍的格言，即除了伴随着某种情绪或精神运动的东西，没有任何物体会呈现在感官上，也没有任何形象会在想象中形成；无论习俗如何使我们对这种感觉无动于衷，并使我们把它与物体或观念混为一谈，通过仔细和准确的实验，都很容易把它们分开并加以区别。仅以延伸和数量为例；很明显，任何非常庞大的物体，如海洋、广阔的平原、巨大的山脉、宽阔的森林；或任何非常多的物体集合，如军队、舰队、人群，都会在头脑中激起一种感性的情绪；而且，这种物体出现时产生的钦佩，是人类本性所能享受的最生动的乐趣之一。现在，由于这种欣赏随着物体的增加或减少而增加或减少，根据我们前面的原则，我们可以得出这样的结论<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-453" title="60">60</a></sup>我们可以得出结论，这是一种复合效应，是由原因的每一部分所产生的几个效应的结合而产生的。那么，延伸的每一部分和数量的每一个结合都有一个单独的情感，当由头脑设想的时候；虽然这种情感并不总是令人满意的，但通过它与其他的结合，并通过它使精神激动到一个适当的高度，它有助于产生钦佩，而钦佩总是令人满意的。如果在延伸和数量方面允许这样做，那么在美德和恶习、智慧和愚蠢、财富和贫穷、幸福和痛苦以及其他类似的对象方面，我们就不会有任何困难，这些对象总是伴随着一种明显的情感。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The second principle I shall take notice of is that of our adherence to <i class="calibre10">general rules</i>; which has such a mighty influence on the actions and understanding, and is able to impose on the very senses. When an object is found by experience to be always accompany'd with another; whenever the first object appears, tho' chang'd in very material circumstances; we naturally fly to the conception of the second, and form an idea of it in as lively and strong a manner, as if we had infer'd its existence by the justest and most authentic conclusion of our understanding. Nothing can undeceive us, not even our senses, which, instead of correcting this false judgment, are often perverted by it, and seem to authorize its errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将注意到的第二个原则是我们对<i class="calibre10">一般规则</i>的遵守；它对行动和理解有如此大的影响，并能强加于感官。当经验发现一个物体总是伴随着另一个物体时；每当第一个物体出现时，尽管在非常重要的情况下发生了变化；我们自然会飞向第二个物体的概念，并以同样生动和强烈的方式形成对它的想法，就好像我们通过我们理解的最公正和最真实的结论来推断它的存在。没有什么能使我们不受欺骗，甚至我们的感官也是如此，它非但没有纠正这种错误的判断，反而常常被它所歪曲，并似乎认可了它的错误。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The conclusion I draw from these two principles, join'd to the influence of comparison above-mention'd, is very short and decisive. Every object is attended with some emotion proportioned to it; a great object with a great emotion, a small object with a small emotion. A great <i class="calibre10">object</i>, therefore, succeeding a small one makes a great <i class="calibre10">emotion</i> succeed a small one. Now a great emotion succeeding a small one becomes still greater, and rises beyond its ordinary proportion. But as there is a certain degree of an emotion, which commonly attends every magnitude of an object; when the emotion encreases, we naturally imagine that the object has likewise encreas'd. The effect conveys our view to its usual cause, a certain degree of emotion to a certain magnitude of the object; nor do we consider, that comparison may change the emotion without changing any thing in the object. Those, who are acquainted with the metaphysical part of optics, and know how we transfer the judgments and conclusions of the understanding to the senses, will easily conceive this whole operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我从这两个原则中得出的结论，再加上上面提到的比较的影响，是非常简短和决定性的。每个物体都伴随着一些与之相称的情感；一个伟大的物体伴随着伟大的情感，一个小物体伴随着小的情感。因此，一个伟大的<i class="calibre10">物体</i>接替一个小的物体，使一个伟大的<i class="calibre10">情感</i>接替一个小的情感。现在，一个伟大的情感继承了一个小的情感，变得更加伟大，并超越了它的普通比例。但是，由于有一定程度的情感，它通常伴随着物体的每一个大小；当情感增加时，我们自然想象物体也同样增加了。效果将我们的观点传达给其通常的原因，一定程度的情感传达给物体的一定大小；我们也没有考虑到，对比可以改变情感而不改变物体的任何东西。那些熟悉光学的形而上学部分，并知道我们如何将理解力的判断和结论转移到感官上的人，会很容易理解这整个操作。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But leaving this new discovery of an impression, that secretly attends every idea; we must at least allow of that principle, from whence the discovery arose, <i class="calibre10">that objects appear greater or less by a comparison with others</i>. We have so many instances of this, that it is impossible we can dispute its veracity; and 'tis from this principle I derive the passions of malice and envy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，撇开这个新发现的印象不谈，它秘密地伴随着每一个想法；我们至少必须允许这个原则，从这个发现产生的原因，<i class="calibre10">即物体通过与其他物体的比较而显得更大或更小</i>。我们有很多这样的例子，以至于我们不可能对它的真实性提出异议；我正是从这个原则中得到了恶意和嫉妒的激情。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis evident we must receive a greater or less satisfaction or uneasiness from reflecting on our own condition and circumstances, in proportion as they appear more or less fortunate or unhappy, in proportion to the degrees of riches, and power, and merit, and reputation, which we think ourselves possest of. Now as we seldom judge of objects from their intrinsic value, but form our notions of them from a comparison with other objects; it follows, that according as we observe a greater or less share of happiness or misery in others, we must make an estimate of our own, and feel a consequent pain or pleasure. The misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our happiness, and his happiness of our misery. The former, therefore, produces delight; and the latter uneasiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">显然，我们必须从反思我们自己的状况和环境中得到更多或更少的满足或不安，这与我们认为自己所拥有的财富、权力、功绩和声誉的程度成正比，因为它们看起来更幸运或更不幸。现在，由于我们很少从物体的内在价值来判断它们，而是通过与其他物体的比较来形成我们对它们的概念；因此，当我们观察到别人的幸福或痛苦的份额较多或较少时，我们必须对自己的幸福或痛苦作出估计，并因此而感到痛苦或快乐。另一个人的痛苦让我们对自己的幸福有了更生动的想法，而他的幸福则是我们的痛苦。因此，前者会产生快乐，后者会产生不安。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Here then is a kind of pity reverst, or contrary sensations arising in the beholder, from those which are felt by the person, whom he considers. In general we may observe, that in all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. A small object makes a great one appear still greater. A great object makes a little one appear less. Deformity of itself produces uneasiness; but makes us receive new pleasure by its contrast with a beautiful object, whose beauty is augmented by it; as on the other hand, beauty, which of itself produces pleasure, makes us receive a new pain by the contrast with any thing ugly, whose deformity it augments. The case, therefore, must be the same with happiness and misery. The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure, and therefore produces pain when compar'd with our own. His pain, consider'd in itself, is painful to us, but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，这里有一种怜悯之情，或者说，在观察者身上产生的感觉与他所考虑的人的感觉相反。一般来说，我们可以观察到，在所有种类的比较中，一个物体总是让我们从它所比较的另一个物体那里得到一种与它直接和直接观察时产生的感觉相反的感觉。一个小的物体使一个大的物体显得更加伟大。一个大物体使一个小物体显得更小。畸形本身会产生不安，但通过与美丽的物体对比，我们会得到新的快乐，因为美丽的物体因畸形而变得更加美丽；另一方面，美丽本身会产生快乐，但通过与任何丑陋的东西对比，我们会得到新的痛苦，因为丑陋的东西因畸形而变得更加痛苦。因此，幸福和痛苦的情况肯定是一样的。直接观察别人的快乐自然会给我们带来快乐，因此在与我们自己的快乐相比较时产生痛苦。他的痛苦，就其本身而言，对我们来说是痛苦的，但却增强了我们自己的幸福感，并给我们带来快乐。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nay a person may extend this malice against himself, even to his present fortune, and carry it so far as designedly to seek affliction, and encrease his pains and sorrows.

'Tis from the principle of comparison that both these irregular appetites for evil arise. A person, who indulges himself in any pleasure, while his friend lies under affliction, feels the reflected uneasiness from his friend more sensibly by a comparison with the original pleasure, which he himself enjoys. This contrast, indeed, ought also to inliven the present pleasure. But as grief is here suppos'd to be the predominant passion, every addition falls to that side, and is swallow'd up in it, without operating in the least upon the contrary affection. 'Tis the same case with those penances, which men inflict on themselves for their past sins and failings. When a criminal reflects on the punishment he deserves, the idea of it is magnify’d by a comparison with his present ease and satisfaction; which forces him, in a manner, to seek uneasiness, in order to avoid so disagreeable a contrast.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">不，一个人可能会把这种对自己的恶意延伸到他现在的财富上，并把它延伸到旨在寻求苦难，增加他的痛苦和悲伤。这可能发生在两个场合。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，在朋友或他所亲爱的人的苦难和不幸中。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，对他所犯的罪行感到悔恨。这两种不正常的邪恶欲望都是从比较的原则产生的。一个人在他的朋友处于痛苦之中时，自己却沉浸在任何快乐之中，通过与他自己所享受的原始快乐相比较，他更能感受到来自他朋友的不安。事实上，这种对比也应该使现在的快乐更有活力。但是，由于悲伤在这里被认为是占主导地位的激情，每一个增加的东西都会落到那一边，并被它吞没，而丝毫不影响相反的感情。人为自己过去的罪行和过失而施加的那些忏悔也是同样的情况。当一个罪犯思考他应得的惩罚时，他的想法会因与他现在的安逸和满足相比较而放大；这在某种程度上迫使他寻求不安，以避免如此令人不快的对比。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This reasoning will account for the origin of envy as well as of malice. The only difference betwixt these passions lies in this, that envy is excited by some present enjoyment of another, which by comparison diminishes our idea of our own: Whereas malice is the unprovok'd desire of producing evil to another, in order to reap a pleasure from the comparison. The enjoyment, which is the object of envy, is commonly superior to our own. A superiority naturally seems to over shade us, and presents a disagreeable comparison. But even in the case of an inferiority, we still desire a greater distance, in order to augment still more the idea of ourself. When this distance diminishes, the comparison is less to our advantage; and consequently gives us less pleasure, and is even disagreeable. Hence arises that species of envy, which men feel, when they perceive their inferiors approaching or overtaking them in the pursuit of glory or happiness. In this envy we may see the effects of comparison twice repeated. A man, who compares himself to his inferior, receives a pleasure from the comparison: And when the inferiority decreases by the elevation of the inferior, what shou'd only have been a decrease of pleasure, becomes a real pain, by a new comparison with its preceding condition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这个推理可以解释嫉妒和恶意的起源。这两种激情之间的唯一区别在于：嫉妒是由另一个人目前的某些享受所激发的，通过比较，它减少了我们对自己的想法。而恶意则是不加掩饰地想给别人制造麻烦，以便从比较中获得快乐。作为嫉妒对象的享受，通常比我们自己的要好。优越性自然会让我们感到不舒服，并产生一种令人不快的比较。但是，即使在劣势的情况下，我们仍然希望有更大的距离，以便进一步增强对我们自己的想法。当这种距离缩小时，这种比较对我们就不那么有利了；因此，给我们带来的快乐就会减少，甚至令人不快。因此，当人们看到他们的下级在追求荣耀或幸福的过程中接近或超过他们时，就会产生那种嫉妒。在这种嫉妒中，我们可以看到比较的效果重复了两次。一个人，如果把自己和他的下级作比较，就会从比较中得到一种快乐。而当劣等人的地位因劣等人的提升而降低时，由于与以前的状况进行新的比较，本来只是一种快乐的减少，却变成了一种真正的痛苦。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">’Tis worthy of observation concerning that envy, which arises from a superiority in others, that 'tis not the great disproportion betwixt ourself and another, which produces it; but on the contrary, our proximity. A common soldier bears no such envy to his general as to his sergeant or corporal; nor does an eminent writer meet with so great jealousy in common hackney scribblers, as in authors, that more nearly approach him. It may, indeed, be thought, that the greater the disproportion is, the greater must be the uneasiness from the comparison. But we may consider on the other hand, that the great disproportion cuts off the tion, and either keeps us from comparing ourselves with what is remote from us, or diminishes the effects of the comparison. Resemblance and proximity always produce a relation of ideas; and where you destroy these ties, however other accidents may bring two ideas together; as they have no bond or connecting quality to join them in the imagination; ’tis impossible they can remain long united, or have any considerable influence on each other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">关于因他人的优势而产生的嫉妒，值得注意的是，产生这种嫉妒的原因不是我们与他人之间的巨大不相称，而是恰恰相反，我们之间的接近。一个普通的士兵对他的将军没有像对他的中士或下士那样的嫉妒；一个杰出的作家在普通的黑客文学家那里也没有遇到如此大的嫉妒，而在更接近他的作家那里却遇到了嫉妒。的确，人们可能会认为，比例失调越大，比较起来的不安就越大。但是，我们可以从另一方面考虑，巨大的不相称切断了这种联系，使我们无法将自己与远离我们的事物进行比较，或者减少了比较的效果。相似和接近总是产生一种观念的关系；如果你破坏了这些纽带，不管其他的意外会使两个观念结合在一起；因为它们在想象中没有纽带或连接的质量；它们不可能保持长期的结合，或对彼此产生任何相当大的影响。</p></div>

When the fancy, in the comparison of objects, passes not easily from the one object to the other, the action of the mind is, in a great measure, broke, and the fancy, in considering the second object, begins, as it were, upon a new footing. The impression, which attends every object, seems not greater in that case by succeeding a less of the same kind; but these two impressions are distinct, and produce their distinct effects, without any communication together. The want of relation in the ideas breaks the relation of the impressions, and by such a separation prevents their mutual operation and influence.</p>

Yet even these relations, when join'd with superiority, by making the comparison more natural, make it likewise more grievous, and cause men to search for some other superiority, which may be attended with no relation, and by that means may have a less sensible influence on the imagination. The mind quickly perceives its several advantages and disadvantages; and finding its situation to be most uneasy, where superiority is conjoin'd with other relations, seeks its repose as much as possible, by their separation, and by breaking that association of ideas, which renders the comparison so much more natural and efficacious. When it cannot break the association, it feels a stronger desire to remove the superiority; and this is the reason why travellers are commonly so lavish of their praises to the <i class="calibre10">Chinese</i> and <i class="calibre10">Persians</i>, at the same time, that they depreciate those neighbouring nations, which may stand upon a foot of rivalship with their native country.</p>

This principle is very remarkable, because it is analogous to what we have observ'd both concerning the <i class="calibre10">understanding</i> and the <i class="calibre10">passions</i>. Suppose two objects to be presented to me, which are not connected by any kind of relation. Suppose that each of these objects separately produces a passion; and that these two passions are in themselves contrary: We find from experience, that the want of relation in the objects or ideas hinders the natural contrariety of the passions, and that the break in the transition of the thought removes the affections from each other, and prevents their opposition. 'Tis the same case with comparison; and from both these phænomena we may safely conclude, that the relation of ideas must forward the transition of impressions; since its absence alone is able to prevent it, and to separate what naturally shou'd have operated upon each other.

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus we have endeavour'd to account for <i class="calibre10">pity</i> and <i class="calibre10">malice</i>. Both these affections arise from the imagination, according to the light, in which it places its object. When our fancy considers directly the sentiments of others, and enters deep into them, it makes us sensible of all the passions it surveys, but in a particular manner of grief or sorrow. On the contrary, when we compare the sentiments of others to our own, we feel a sensation directly opposite to the original one, it is a joy from the grief of others, and a grief from their joy. But these are only the first foundations of the affections of pity and malice. Other passions are afterwards confounded with them. There is always a mixture of love or tenderness with pity, and of hatred or anger with malice. But it must be confess'd, that this mixture seems at first sight to be contradictory to my system. For as pity is an uneasiness, and malice a joy, arising from the misery of others, pity shou'd naturally, as in all other cases, produce hatred; and malice, love. This contradiction I endeavour to reconcile, after the following manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们已经努力解释了<i class="calibre10">怜悯</i>和<i class="calibre10">恶意</i>的原因。这两种情感都是由想象力产生的，取决于它将其对象置于何种光景之中。当我们的想象力直接考虑他人的情感，并深入其中时，它使我们感受到它所调查的所有激情，但却以一种特殊的方式感到悲伤或难过。相反，当我们把别人的情感与我们自己的情感相比较时，我们会感到一种与原来的情感直接相反的感觉，它是一种来自别人的悲伤的快乐，和一种来自别人的快乐的悲伤。但这些只是怜悯和恶意的情感的最初基础。其他的激情后来就与它们混为一谈了。怜悯中总是夹杂着爱或温柔，而仇恨或愤怒中夹杂着恶意。但必须承认的是，这种混合乍一看似乎与我的体系相矛盾。因为怜悯是一种不安，而恶意是一种快乐，是由他人的痛苦引起的，怜悯自然会像在其他情况下一样，产生仇恨；而恶意则产生爱。我努力按照以下方式来调和这种矛盾。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to cause a transition of passions, there is requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas, nor is one relation sufficient to produce this effect. But that we may understand the full force of this double relation, we must consider, that 'tis not the present sensation alone or momentary pain or pleasure, which determines the character of any passion, but the whole bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end. One impression may be related to another, not only when their sensations are resembling, as we have all along suppos'd in the preceding cases; but also when their impulses or directions are similar and correspondent. This cannot take place with regard to pride and humility; because these are only pure sensations, without any direction or tendency to action. We are, therefore, to look for instances of this peculiar relation of impressions only in such affections, as are attended with a certain appetite or desire; such as those of love and hatred.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了引起激情的转变，需要有印象和观念的双重关系，一个关系也不足以产生这种效果。但是，为了使我们能够理解这种双重关系的全部力量，我们必须考虑到，决定任何激情特征的不是当前的感觉，也不是一时的痛苦或快乐，而是它从开始到结束的整个弯曲或趋势。一个印象可能与另一个印象有关，不仅当它们的感觉相似时，正如我们在前面的案例中一直假设的那样；而且当它们的冲动或方向相似和对应时。对于骄傲和谦卑来说，这是不可能发生的；因为这些只是纯粹的感觉，没有任何行动的方向或倾向。因此，我们要寻找这种印象的特殊关系的例子，只有在有某种食欲或欲望的情感中，如爱与恨的情感。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Benevolence or the appetite, which attends love, is a desire of the happiness of the person belov'd, and an aversion to his misery; as anger or the appetite, which attends hatred, is a desire of the misery of the person hated, and an aversion to his happiness. A desire, therefore, of the happiness of another, and aversion to his misery, are similar to benevolence; and a desire of his misery and aversion to his happiness are correspondent to anger. Now pity is a desire of happiness to another, and aversion to his misery; as malice is the contrary appetite. Pity, then, is related to benevolence; and malice to anger: And as benevolence has been already found to be connected with love, by a natural and original quality, and anger with hatred; 'tis by this chain the passions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">伴随着爱的仁慈或食欲，是对所爱之人的幸福的渴望，以及对其痛苦的厌恶；正如伴随着恨的愤怒或食欲，是对所恨之人的痛苦的渴望，以及对其幸福的厌恶。因此，对他人幸福的渴望和对其痛苦的厌恶，与仁爱相似；对其痛苦的渴望和对其幸福的厌恶，与愤怒相应。现在，怜悯是对他人幸福的渴望和对其痛苦的厌恶；正如恶意是相反的食欲。因此，怜悯与仁爱有关，而恶意与愤怒有关。由于仁爱已经被发现与爱有关，通过一种自然和原始的品质，而愤怒与仇恨有关；通过这种链条，怜悯和恶意的激情与爱和仇恨有关。</p></div>

What wonder, then, that pity and benevolence, malice, and anger, being the same desires arising from different principles, shou'd so totally mix together as to be undistinguishable?

From a sympathy with his pleasure there arises love; from that with his uneasiness, hatred. But 'tis a maxim, which I have just now establish'd, and which is absolutely necessary to the explication of the phænomena of pity and malice, 'That 'tis not the present sensation or momentary pain or pleasure, which determines the character of any passion, but the general bent or tendency of it from the beginning to the end.' For this reason, pity or a sympathy with pain produces love, and that because it interests us in the fortunes of others, good or bad, and gives us a secondary sensation correspondent to the primary; in which it has the same influence with love and benevolence. Since then this rule holds good in one case, why does it not prevail throughout, and why does sympathy in uneasiness ever produce any passion beside good-will and kindness?

		<p class="block_6 cn">但这里出现了一个相当大的反对意见，在我们进一步讨论之前，有必要对它进行研究。我已经努力证明，权力和财富，或者贫穷和吝啬；它们会引起爱或恨，而不产生任何原始的快乐或不安；它们通过对拥有它们的人所产生的痛苦或满足的同情而在我们身上发生次要的感觉。从对其快乐的同情中产生了爱，从对其不安的同情中产生了恨。但是，我刚才已经确立了一条格言，这条格言对于解释怜悯和恶意的现象是绝对必要的，"决定任何激情特征的不是当前的感觉或一时的痛苦或快乐，而是它从开始到结束的一般倾向或趋势。由于这个原因，怜悯或对痛苦的同情会产生爱，这是因为它使我们对他人的命运感兴趣，不管是好的还是坏的，并给我们一种与主要感觉相对应的次要感觉；在这一点上，它与爱和仁慈有相同的影响。既然这条规则在一种情况下是有效的，那么为什么它不能贯穿始终，为什么在不安中的同情会产生善意和仁慈之外的任何激情？难道一个哲学家要改变他的推理方法，根据他要解释的特定现象，从一个原则跑到另一个原则吗？</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis certain, that sympathy is not always limited to the present moment, but that we often feel by communication the pains and pleasures of others, which are not in being, and which we only anticipate by the force of imagination. For supposing I saw a person perfectly unknown to me, who, while asleep in the fields, was in danger of being trod under foot by horses, I shou'd immediately run to his assistance; and in this I shou'd be actuated by the same principle of sympathy, which makes me concern'd for the present sorrows of a stranger. The bare mention of this is sufficient. Sympathy being nothing but a lively idea converted into an impression, 'tis evident, that, in considering the future possible or probable condition of any person, we may enter into it with so vivid a conception as to make it our own concern; and by that means be sensible of pains and pleasures, which neither belong to ourselves, nor at the present instant have any real existence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">可以肯定的是，同情心并不总是局限于当下，我们经常通过交流来感受他人的痛苦和快乐，而这些痛苦和快乐并不存在，我们只是通过想象的力量来预见。假设我看到一个完全不认识的人，在田野里睡觉时有被马踩踏的危险，我应该立即跑去帮助他；在这一点上，我应该受到同样的同情原则的驱使，这使我对一个陌生人目前的悲哀感到关切。仅仅提到这一点就足够了。同情只不过是一种转化为印象的生动想法，很明显，在考虑任何人未来可能或可能的状况时，我们可以以如此生动的概念进入其中，使之成为我们自己的关切；并通过这种方式感受到痛苦和快乐，而这些痛苦和快乐既不属于我们自己，在目前也没有任何实际存在。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But however we may look forward to the future in sympathizing with any person, the extending of our sympathy depends in a great measure upon our sense of his present condition. 'Tis a great effort of imagination, to form such lively ideas even of the present sentiments of others as to feel these very sentiments; but 'tis impossible we cou'd extend this sympathy to the future, without being aided by some circumstance in the present, which strikes upon us in a lively manner. When the present misery of another has any strong influence upon me, the vivacity of the conception is not confin'd merely to its immediate object, but diffuses its influence over all the related ideas, and gives me a lively notion of all the circumstances of that person, whether past, present, or future; possible, probable or certain. By means of this lively notion I am interested in them; take part with them; and feel a sympathetic motion in my breast, conformable to whatever I imagine in his. If I diminish the vivacity of the first conception, I diminish that of the related ideas; as pipes can convey no more water than what arises at the fountain. By this diminution I destroy the future prospect, which is necessary to interest me perfectly in the fortune of another. I may feel the present impression, but carry my sympathy no farther, and never transfuse the force of the first conception into my ideas of the related objects. If it be another's misery, which is presented in this feeble manner, I receive it by communication, and am affected with all the passions related to it: But as I am not so much interested as to concern myself in his good fortune, as well as his bad, I never feel the extensive sympathy, nor the passions related to <i class="calibre10">it</i>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，无论我们在同情任何人时如何展望未来，我们的同情心的延伸在很大程度上取决于我们对他目前状况的感觉。要想对他人现在的情绪形成如此生动的想法，甚至感受到这些情绪，是需要付出巨大的想象力的；但是，如果没有现在的某些情况的帮助，我们不可能将这种同情延伸到未来，这些情况以生动的方式冲击着我们。当另一个人目前的痛苦对我有任何强烈的影响时，这种概念的活力不仅仅局限于它的直接对象，而是把它的影响扩散到所有相关的想法上，并使我对这个人的所有情况有一个生动的概念，无论是过去、现在还是将来；可能的、可能的或确定的。通过这种生动的概念，我对他们感兴趣；与他们一起参与；并在我的胸中感受到一种同情的运动，与我在他身上所想象的相一致。如果我减少了第一个概念的活力，我就减少了相关概念的活力；就像水管不能输送比喷泉产生的更多的水。通过这种削弱，我破坏了未来的前景，而这种前景是使我对另一个人的命运完全感兴趣所必需的。我可能会感受到当前的印象，但我的同情心不会走得更远，也不会把第一个概念的力量注入我对相关对象的想法。如果是别人的苦难，以这种微弱的方式呈现出来，我通过交流接受它，并受到与之相关的所有激情的影响。但是，由于我对他的好运气和坏运气没有那么大的兴趣，所以我从来没有感到广泛的同情，也没有与<i class="calibre10">之</i>相关的激情。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now in order to know what passions are related to these different kinds of sympathy, we must consider, that benevolence is an original pleasure arising from the pleasure of the person belov'd, and a pain proceeding from his pain: From which correspondence of impressions there arises a subsequent desire of his pleasure, and aversion to his pain. In order, then, to make a passion run parallel with benevolence, 'tis requisite we shou'd feel these double impressions, correspondent to those of the person, whom we consider; nor is any one of them alone sufficient for that purpose. When we sympathize only with one impression, and that a painful one, this sympathy is related to anger and to hatred, upon account of the uneasiness it conveys to us. But as the extensive or limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy; it follows, that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same principle. A strong impression, when communicated, gives a double tendency of the passions; which is related to benevolence and love by a similarity of direction; however painful the first impression might have been. A weak impression, that is painful, is related to anger and hatred by the resemblance of sensations. Benevolence, therefore, arises from a great degree of misery, or any degree strongly sympathize'd with: Hatred or contempt from a small degree, or one weakly sympathize'd with; which is the principle I intended to prove and explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，为了知道这些不同的同情心与什么激情有关，我们必须考虑，仁爱是一种最初的快乐，产生于所爱之人的快乐，而痛苦则来自他的痛苦。从这种印象的对应关系中，随后产生了对他的快乐的渴望和对他的痛苦的厌恶。因此，为了使激情与仁爱并行，我们必须感受到这些双重印象，与我们所考虑的人的印象相对应；单单其中任何一个印象也不足以达到这个目的。当我们只同情一个印象，而且是一个痛苦的印象时，这种同情与愤怒和憎恨有关，因为它给我们带来了不安。但是，由于广泛或有限的同情取决于第一个同情的力量；因此，爱或恨的激情也取决于同样的原则。一个强烈的印象，一旦被传达，就会产生双重的激情倾向；这与仁慈和爱有相似的方向；无论第一印象是多么痛苦。一个微弱的印象，即痛苦的印象，通过感觉的相似性与愤怒和仇恨相关。因此，仁爱产生于巨大的痛苦程度，或任何强烈同情的程度。仇恨或蔑视来自于小的程度，或弱的同情；这就是我打算证明和解释的原则。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor have we only our reason to trust to for this principle, but also experience. A certain degree of poverty produces contempt; but a degree beyond causes compassion and good-will. We may under-value a peasant or servant; but when the misery of a beggar appears very great, or is painted in very lively colours, we sympathize with him in his addictions, and feel in our heart evident touches of pity and benevolence. The same object causes contrary passions according to its different degrees. The passions, therefore, must depend upon principles, that operate in such certain degrees, according to my hypothesis. The encrease of the sympathy has evidently the same effect as the encrease of the misery.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这个原则上，我们也不仅仅要相信我们的理性，还要相信经验。一定程度的贫困会产生蔑视；但超过一定程度的贫困会引起同情和善意。我们可能会低估一个农民或仆人的价值；但当一个乞丐的痛苦显得非常大，或被描绘成非常生动的色彩时，我们就会同情他的嗜好，并在我们的心中感受到明显的怜悯和仁慈的触动。同样的对象根据其不同的程度而引起相反的激情。因此，根据我的假设，这些激情必须取决于在这种特定程度上运作的原则。同情的增加显然与苦难的增加有相同的效果。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">A barren or desolate country always seems ugly and disagreeable, and commonly inspires us with contempt for the inhabitants. This deformity, however, proceeds in a great measure from a sympathy with the inhabitants, as has been already observ'd; but it is only a weak one, and reaches no farther than the immediate sensation, which is disagreeable. The view of a city in ashes conveys benevolent sentiments; because we there enter so deep into the interests of the miserable inhabitants, as to wish for their prosperity, as well as feel their adversity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">一个贫瘠或荒凉的国家总是显得丑陋和令人不快，而且通常使我们对居民产生蔑视。然而，这种畸形在很大程度上来自于对居民的同情，正如我们已经观察到的那样；但这只是一种微弱的同情，并没有达到比直接感觉更远的程度，即令人不快。灰烬中的城市的景象传达了仁慈的情感；因为我们在那里深深地进入了悲惨的居民的利益，希望他们的繁荣，同时也感受到他们的不幸。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' the force of the impression generally produces pity and benevolence, 'tis certain, that by being carry'd too far it ceases to have that effect. This, perhaps, may be worth our notice. When the uneasiness is either small in itself, or remote from us, it engages not the imagination, nor is able to convey an equal concern for the fixture and contingent good, as for the present and real evil. Upon its acquiring greater force, we become so interested in the concerns of the person, as to be sensible both of his good and bad fortune; and from that compleat sympathy there arises pity and benevolence. But 'twill easily be imagin'd, that where the present evil strikes with more than ordinary force, it may entirely engage our attention, and prevent that double sympathy, above-mention'd. Thus we find, that tho' every one, but especially women, are apt to contract a kindness for criminals, who go to the scaffold, and readily imagine them to be uncommonly handsome and well-shap'd; yet one, who is present at the cruel execution of the rack, feels no such tender emotions; but is in a manner overcome with horror, and has no leisure to temper this uneasy sensation by any opposite sympathy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管这种印象的力量通常会产生怜悯和仁慈，但可以肯定的是，由于走得太远，它就不再具有这种效果了。这一点，也许值得我们注意。当这种不安本身很小，或者离我们很远的时候，它就不会引起想象力，也不能传达出对固定的和偶然的善与对当前的和真实的恶的同等关注。当它获得更大的力量时，我们就会对这个人的关切感兴趣，以至于对他的好运气和坏运气都感同身受；从这种完全的同情中，产生了怜悯和仁慈。但是，我们很容易想象到，当当前的邪恶以超过一般的力量袭来时，它可能完全吸引我们的注意力，并阻止上述的双重同情。因此，我们发现，尽管每个人，尤其是妇女，都会对走上绞刑架的罪犯产生好感，并且很容易想象他们是非常英俊和身材匀称的；然而，一个人，如果在残酷的绞刑现场，就不会感到这种温柔的情感；而是被恐怖所征服，没有闲情逸致通过任何相反的同情来调节这种不安的感觉。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But the instance, which makes the most clearly for my hypothesis, is that wherein' by a change of the objects we separate the double sympathy even from a midling degree of the passion; in which case we find, that pity, instead of producing love and tenderness as usual, always gives rise to the contrary affection. When we observe a person in misfortunes, we are affected with pity and love; but the author of that misfortune becomes the object of our strongest hatred, and is the more detested in proportion to the degree of our compassion. Now for what reason shou'd the same passion of pity produce love to the person, who suffers the misfortune, and hatred to the person, who causes it; unless it be because in the latter case the author bears a relation only to the misfortune; whereas in considering the sufferer we carry our view on every side, and wish for his prosperity, as well as are sensible of his affliction?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但最能证明我的假设的例子是，通过改变对象，我们把双重同情甚至从激情的中等程度中分离出来；在这种情况下，我们发现，怜悯不是像通常那样产生爱和温柔，而是总是引起相反的感情。当我们观察一个人的不幸时，我们会受到怜悯和爱的影响；但不幸的制造者却成为我们最强烈的憎恨对象，而且与我们同情的程度成正比，更加憎恨。现在，为什么同样的怜悯热情会对遭受不幸的人产生爱，而对造成不幸的人产生恨；除非是因为在后一种情况下，作者只与不幸有关系；而在考虑受苦的人时，我们会从各方面考虑，希望他繁荣，同时也意识到他的苦难？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall just observe, before I leave the present subject, that this phænomenon of the double sympathy, and its tendency to cause love, may contribute to the production of the kindness, which we naturally bear our relations and acquaintance. Custom and relation make us enter deeply into the sentiments of others; and whatever fortune we suppose to attend them, is render'd present to us by the imagination, and operates as if originally our own. We rejoice in their pleasures, and grieve for their sorrows, merely from the force of sympathy. Nothing that concerns them is indifferent to us; and as this correspondence of sentiments is the natural attendant of love, it readily produces that affection.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我离开这个话题之前，我只想说，这种双重同情的现象，以及它引起爱的趋势，可能有助于产生我们自然地对我们的关系和熟人的善意。习惯和关系使我们深入了解他人的情感；无论我们认为他们有什么财富，都会通过想象力呈现给我们，并像我们自己的一样运作。我们为他们的快乐而高兴，为他们的悲哀而悲伤，这仅仅是出于同情的力量。与他们有关的任何事情对我们来说都是无所谓的；由于这种情感的对应关系是爱的自然伴随物，它很容易产生这种感情。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In considering the qualities and circumstances of others, we may either regard them as they really are in themselves; or may make a comparison betwixt them and our own qualities and circumstances; or may join these two methods of consideration. The good qualities of others, from the first point of view, produce love; from the second, humility; and from the third, respect; which is a mixture of these two passions.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">That there is a mixture of pride in contempt, and of humility in respect, is, I think, too evident, from their very feeling or appearance, to require any particular proof. That this mixture arises from a tacit comparison of the person condemn'd or respected with ourselves is no less evident. The same man may cause either respect, love, or contempt by his condition and talents, according as the person, who considers him, from his inferior becomes his equal or superior. In changing the point of view, tho' the object may remain the same, its proportion to ourselves entirely alters; which is the cause of an alteration in the passions. These passions, therefore, arise from our observing the proportion; that is, from a comparison.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我认为，从他们的感觉或外表来看，蔑视中夹杂着骄傲，尊重中夹杂着谦卑，这一点非常明显，不需要任何特别的证明。这种混合产生于对被谴责或被尊重的人与我们自己的默契比较，这一点也很明显。同一个人可能会因为他的条件和才能而引起尊重、爱戴或蔑视，这取决于考虑他的人，从他的下级变成他的平等或高级。在改变观点时，尽管对象可能保持不变，但它与我们的比例完全改变了；这就是激情改变的原因。因此，这些激情产生于我们对比例的观察；也就是说，产生于比较。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I have already observ'd, that the mind has a much stronger propensity to pride than to humility, and have endeavour'd, from the principles of human nature, to assign a cause for this phænomenon. Whether my reasoning be receiv'd or not, the phænomenon is undisputed, and appears in many instances. Among the rest, 'tis the reason why there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect, and why we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortify'd with the presence of one above us. Contempt or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride, that there scarce is any other passion discernable: Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility. The passion of vanity is so prompt, that it rouzes at the least call; while humility requires a stronger impulse to make it exert itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我已经注意到，人的思想有一种比谦卑更强烈的倾向，并努力从人性的原则出发，为这种现象找到原因。不管我的推理是否被接受，这种现象是无可争议的，而且出现在许多事例中。在其余的例子中，这就是为什么蔑视中的骄傲比尊重中的谦卑要多得多的原因，也是为什么我们在看到低于我们的人的时候会更加高傲，而在看到高于我们的人的时候会更加羞愧。蔑视或轻蔑具有如此强烈的傲慢色彩，以至于很少有其他激情可言。而在尊敬或尊重中，爱的成分比谦卑更多。虚荣的激情是如此迅速，以至于它在最短的时间内就会被唤醒；而谦逊则需要更强烈的冲动来使它发挥自己的作用。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But here it may reasonably be ask'd, why this mixture takes place only in some cases, and appears not on every occasion. All those objects, which cause love, when plac'd on another person, are the causes of pride, when transfer'd to ourselves; and consequently ought to be causes of humility, as well as love, while they belong to others, and are only compar'd to those, which we ourselves possess. In like manner every quality, which, by being directly consider'd, produces hatred, ought always to give rise to pride by comparison, and by a mixture of these passions of hatred and pride ought to excite contempt or scorn. The difficulty then is, why any objects ever cause pure love or hatred, and produce not always the mixt passions of respect and contempt.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但在这里，人们有理由问，为什么这种混合只发生在某些情况下，而不是在每个场合都出现。所有那些在别人身上引起爱的东西，在转移到我们自己身上时，都是骄傲的原因；因此，当它们属于别人时，应该是谦卑的原因，也是爱的原因，而且只是与我们自己拥有的东西相比较。同样地，每一种品质，如果被直接考虑，产生仇恨，就应该通过比较而产生骄傲，而通过仇恨和骄傲的混合，应该引起蔑视或轻蔑的激情。那么困难的是，为什么任何物体都会引起纯粹的爱或恨，而不总是产生尊重和蔑视的混合激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I have suppos'd all along, that the passions of love and pride, and those of humility and hatred are similar in their sensations, and that the two former are always agreeable, and the two latter painful. But tho' this be universally true, 'tis observable, that the two agreeable, as well as the two painful passions, have some differences, and even contrarieties, which distinguish them. Nothing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity; tho' at the same time love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and infeeble it. The same difference is observable betwixt the uneasy passions. Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions; while humility and shame deject and discourage us. Of these qualities of the passions, 'twill be necessary to form a distinct idea. Let us remember, that pride and hatred invigorate the soul; and love and humility infeeble it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我一直认为，爱与骄傲的激情和谦卑与仇恨的激情在感觉上是相似的，前者总是令人愉快，后者则是令人痛苦。但是，尽管这是普遍的事实，我们可以看到，这两种令人愉快的激情，以及这两种令人痛苦的激情，都有一些区别，甚至是反差，使它们与众不同。没有什么东西能像骄傲和虚荣一样振奋和提升心灵；但同时，爱或温柔反而被发现会削弱和降低它。不安的激情之间也有同样的区别。愤怒和憎恨给我们所有的思想和行动带来了新的力量；而谦卑和羞耻则使我们感到沮丧和气馁。对于这些激情的品质，我们有必要形成一个独特的概念。让我们记住，骄傲和仇恨使灵魂振奋；而爱和谦卑则使它衰弱。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">From this it follows, that tho' the conformity betwixt love and hatred in the agreeableness of their sensation makes them always be excited by the same objects, yet this other contrariety is the reason, why they are excited in very different degrees. Genius and learning are <i class="calibre10">pleasant</i> and <i class="calibre10">magnificant</i> objects, and by both these circumstances are adapted to pride and vanity; but have a relation to love by their pleasure only. Ignorance and simplicity are <i class="calibre10">disagreeable</i> and <i class="calibre10">mean</i>, which in the same manner gives them a double connexion with humility, and a single one with hatred. We may, therefore, consider it as certain, that tho' the same object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, according to its different situations, yet it seldom produces either the two former or the two latter passions in the same proportion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">由此可见，尽管爱与恨在感觉上的一致性使它们总是被相同的对象所激发，但这另一种反差是它们被激发的程度非常不同的原因。天才和学问是<i class="calibre10">令人愉快的</i>和<i class="calibre10">伟大的</i>对象，并且在这两种情况下都适合于骄傲和虚荣；但与爱情的关系仅仅在于它们的快乐。无知和单纯是<i class="calibre10">令人不</i>快和<i class="calibre10">卑劣</i>的，这同样使它们与谦卑有双重联系，而与憎恨有单一联系。因此，我们可以认为这是肯定的，尽管同一个物体总是根据其不同的情况产生爱和骄傲，谦卑和仇恨，但它很少以相同的比例产生前两种或后两种激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis here we must seek for a solution of the difficulty above-mention'd, why any object ever excites pure love or hatred, and does not always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride. No quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison, unless it wou'd have produc'd pride by being plac'd in ourselves; and <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i> no object excites pride by comparison, unless it wou'd have produc'd humility by the direct survey. This is evident, objects always produce by <i class="calibre10">comparison</i> a sensation directly contrary to their <i class="calibre10">original</i> one. Suppose, therefore, an object to be presented, which is peculiarly fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite pride; this object, belonging to another, gives rise directly to a great degree of love, but to a small one of humility by comparison; and consequently that latter passion is scarce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love into respect. This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility, generosity, beauty, and many other qualities. These have a peculiar aptitude to produce love in others; but not so great a tendency to excite pride in ourselves: For which reason the view of them, as belonging to another person, produces pure love, with but a small mixture of humility and respect. 'Tis easy to extend the same reasoning to the opposite passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这里，我们必须寻求上述困难的解决办法，即为什么任何物体都会引起纯粹的爱或恨，而不总是通过混合谦卑或骄傲而产生尊重或蔑视。另一个人的品质不会因为比较而产生谦卑，除非它在我们身上会产生骄傲；<i class="calibre10">反之</i>，任何物体都不会因为比较而产生骄傲，除非它在直接调查中会产生谦卑。这是显而易见的，物体总是通过<i class="calibre10">比较</i>产生一种与它们<i class="calibre10">原来的</i>感觉直接相反的感觉。因此，假设有一个物体，它特别适合于产生爱，但不完全适合于激发骄傲；这个物体属于另一个物体，直接引起了很大程度的爱，但通过比较却引起了很小程度的谦卑；因此，后一种激情在复合体中很少感觉到，也无法将爱转化为尊重。好的天性、好的幽默、便利、慷慨、美丽和其他许多品质都是如此。这些都有一种特殊的能力，可以在别人身上产生爱；但却没有那么大的倾向来激发我们的骄傲。因此，把它们看成是属于另一个人的，就会产生纯粹的爱，但也会有少量的谦卑和尊重。将同样的推理延伸到相反的激情是很容易的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Before we leave this subject, it may not be amiss to account for a pretty curious phænomenon, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> why we commonly keep at a distance such as we contemn, and allow not our inferiors to approach too near even in place and situation. It has already been observ'd, that almost every kind of idea is attended with some emotion, even the ideas of number and extension, much more those of such objects as are esteem'd of consequence in life, and fix our attention. 'Tis not with entire indifference we can survey either a rich man or a poor one, but must feel some faint touches, at least, of respect in the former case, and of contempt in the latter. These two passions are contrary to each other; but in order to make this contrariety be felt, the objects must he someway related; otherwise the affections are totally separate and distinct, and never encounter. The relation takes place wherever the persons become contiguous; which is a general reason why we are uneasy at seeing such disproportion'd objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a nobleman and a porter, in that situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们离开这个话题之前，我们不妨解释一下一个相当奇怪的现象，<i class="calibre10">即</i>为什么我们通常与我们所谴责的人保持距离，而不允许我们的下级甚至在地点和情况上过于接近。我们已经注意到，几乎每一种观念都伴随着一些情绪，甚至是数量和范围的观念，更多的是那些在生活中被视为重要的对象，并固定我们的注意力。我们不是完全无动于衷地看待一个富人或穷人，而是必须感到一些微弱的触动，至少在前一种情况下是尊敬，在后一种情况下是蔑视。这两种激情是相互矛盾的；但为了使这种矛盾被感觉到，对象必须有某种程度的联系；否则，这种情感是完全独立和不同的，而且永远不会相遇。这种关系发生在人与人相邻的地方；这就是为什么我们在看到富人和穷人、贵族和搬运工这样不相称的对象时感到不安的一个一般原因。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This uneasiness, which is common to every spectator, must be more sensible to the superior; and that because the near approach of the inferior is regarded as a piece of ill-breeding, and shews that he is not sensible of the disproportion, and is no way affected by it. A sense of superiority in another breeds in all men an inclination to keep themselves at a distance from him, and determines them to redouble the marks of respect and reverence, when they are oblig'd to approach him; and where they do not observe that conduct, ’tis a proof they are not sensible of his superiority. From hence too it proceeds, that any great <i class="calibre10">difference</i> in the degrees of any quality is call'd a <i class="calibre10">distance</i> by a common metaphor, which, however trivial it may appear, is founded on natural principles of the imagination. A great difference inclines us to produce a distance. The ideas of distance and difference are, therefore, connected together. Connected ideas are readily taken for each other; and this is in general the source of the metaphor, as we shall have occasion to observe afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种不安是每个观众都会有的，但对上级来说，一定更有感觉；这是因为下级的接近被认为是一种不良的教养，表明他对这种不相称的情况没有感觉，也没有受到这种影响。对另一个人的优越感使所有的人都倾向于与他保持距离，并决定他们在不得不接近他时要加倍尊重和敬畏；如果他们不遵守这种行为，就证明他们不了解他的优越感。由此也可以看出，任何品质的程度上的任何巨大<i class="calibre10">差异</i>都被一个常见的比喻称为<i class="calibre10">距离</i>，无论它看起来多么微不足道，都是建立在自然的想象力原则之上。巨大的差异使我们倾向于产生一种距离。因此，距离和差异的概念是连在一起的。相连的概念很容易被认为是彼此的；而这一般是隐喻的来源，我们以后会有机会观察到。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Of all the compound passions, which proceed from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections, no one better deserves our attention, than that love, which arises betwixt the sexes, as well on account of its force and violence, as those curious principles of philosophy, for which it affords us an incontestable argument. 'Tis plain, that this affection, in its most natural state, is deriv'd from the conjunction of three different impressions or passions, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> The pleasing sensation arising from beauty; the bodily appetite for generation; and a generous kindness or good-will. The origin of kindness from beauty may be explain'd from the foregoing reasoning. The question is how the bodily appetite is excited by it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在所有由爱和恨与其他情感混合而产生的复合激情中，最值得我们注意的莫过于在两性之间产生的爱，这既是由于它的力量和暴力，也是由于那些好奇的哲学原理，它为我们提供了一个无可争辩的论据。很明显，这种感情，在其最自然的状态下，是由三种不同的印象或激情结合而成的，<i class="calibre10">即：</i>由美感产生的愉悦感；身体的生成欲；以及慷慨的仁慈或善意。从前面的推理中，我们可以解释仁慈来源于美。问题是身体的食欲是如何被它激发的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The appetite of generation, when confin'd to a certain degree, is evidently of the pleasant kind, and has a strong connexion with all the agreeable emotions. Joy, mirth, vanity, and kindness are all incentives to this desire; as well as music, dancing, wine, and good cheer. On the other hand, sorrow, melancholy, poverty, humility are destructive of it. From this quality 'tis easily conceiv'd why it shou'd be connected with the sense of beauty.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">生成的欲望，当限制在一定程度上时，显然是愉快的那种，并与所有令人愉快的情绪有密切的联系。喜悦、欢笑、虚荣和仁慈都是这种欲望的诱因；还有音乐、舞蹈、酒和好心情。另一方面，悲伤、忧郁、贫穷、谦逊都是对它的破坏。从这一特质可以很容易地想象出为什么它应该与美感相联系。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But there is another principle that contributes to the same effect. I have observ'd that the parallel direction of the desires is a real relation, and no less than a resemblance in their sensation, produces a connexion among them. That we may fully comprehend the extent of this relation, we must consider, that any principal desire may be attended with subordinate ones, which are connected with it, and to which if other desires are parallel, they are by that means related to the principal one. Thus hunger may oft be consider'd as the primary inclination of the soul, and the desire of approaching the meat as the secondary one; since 'tis absolutely necessary to the satisfying that appetite. If an object, therefore by any separate qualities, inclines us to approach the meat, it naturally encreases our appetite; as on the contrary, whatever inclines us to set our victuals at a distance, is contradictory to hunger, and diminishes our inclination to them. Now 'tis plain that beauty has the first effect, and deformity the second: Which is the reason why the former gives us a keener appetite for our victuals, and the latter is sufficient to disgust us at the most savoury dish, that cookery has invented. All this is easily applicable to the appetite for generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但还有另一个原则有助于产生同样的效果。我已经注意到，欲望的平行方向是一种真正的关系，而且不亚于它们感觉上的相似性，在它们之间产生一种联系。为了让我们充分理解这种关系的程度，我们必须考虑到，任何主要的欲望都可能伴随着与之相关的次要的欲望，如果其他的欲望与之平行，它们就会通过这种方式与主要的欲望相关。因此，饥饿常常被认为是灵魂的主要倾向，而接近肉的欲望则是次要的；因为这对于满足这种胃口是绝对必要的。因此，如果一个物体，通过任何单独的品质，使我们倾向于接近肉，它自然会增加我们的食欲；相反，任何使我们倾向于把食物放在远处的东西，都与饥饿相矛盾，并减少我们对它们的倾向。这就是为什么前者让我们对食物有更强烈的食欲，而后者则足以让我们对厨艺所发明的最美味的菜肴感到厌恶。所有这些都很容易适用于生成的胃口。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">From these two relations, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> resemblance and a parallel desire, there arises such a connexion betwixt the sense of beauty, the bodily appetite, and benevolence, that they become in a manner inseparable: And we find from experience, that 'tis indifferent which of them advances first; since any of them is almost sure to be attended with the related affections. One, who is inflam'd with lust, feels at least a momentary kindness towards the object of it, and at the same time fancies her more beautiful than ordinary; as there are many, who begin with kindness and esteem for the wit and merit of the person, and advance from that to the other passions. But the most common species of love is that which first arises from beauty, and afterwards diffuses itself into kindness and into the bodily appetite. Kindness or esteem, and the appetite to generation, are too remote to unite easily together. The one is, perhaps, the most refin'd passion of the soul; the other the most gross and vulgar. The love of beauty is plac'd in a just medium betwixt them, and partakes of both their natures: From whence it proceeds, that 'tis so singularly fitted to produce both.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从这两种关系，<i class="calibre10">即</i>相似性和平行的欲望，在美感、身体食欲和仁爱之间产生了这样一种联系，以至于它们在某种程度上成为不可分割的。我们从经验中发现，它们中的哪一个首先出现是无所谓的；因为它们中的任何一个几乎都肯定会与相关的情感相伴。一个被情欲冲昏头脑的人，至少对它的对象有一时的好感，同时认为她比一般人更漂亮；也有许多人从好感和对对方的智慧和优点的尊重开始，并由此发展到其他的激情。但最常见的爱的种类是，首先从美产生，然后扩散到仁慈和身体的食欲中。仁慈或尊敬，以及生成的食欲，都太遥远，不容易结合在一起。一个可能是灵魂中最精致的激情；另一个则是最粗俗的。爱美之心是介于两者之间的，同时具有这两种性质。由此可见，它是如此奇特地适合产生这两种性质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This account of love is not peculiar to my system, but is unavoidable on any hypothesis. The three affections, which compose this passion, are evidently distinct, and has each of them its distinct object. 'Tis certain, therefore, that 'tis only by their relation they produce each other. But the relation of passions is not alone sufficient. 'Tis likewise necessary, there shou'd be a relation of ideas. The beauty of one person never inspires us with love for another. This then is a sensible proof of the double relation of impressions and ideas From one instance so evident as this we may form a judgment of the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">关于爱情的这种说法并不是我的体系所特有的，但在任何假设下都是不可避免的。构成这种激情的三种情感显然是不同的，而且每一种情感都有其独特的目标。因此，可以肯定的是，只有通过它们之间的关系，它们才能相互产生。但是，仅仅有激情的关系是不够的。同样必要的是，还应该有一种观念的关系。一个人的美不会激发我们对另一个人的爱。这就是印象和观念的双重关系的一个明显的证据。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This may also serve in another view to illustrate what I have insisted on concerning the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred I have observ'd, that tho' self be the object of the first set of passions, and some other person of the second, yet these objects cannot alone be the causes of the passions; as having each of them a relation to two contrary affections, which must from the very first moment destroy each other. Here then is the situation of the mind, as I have already describ'd it. It has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a passion; that passion, when produc'd, naturally tums the view to a certain object. But this not being sufficient to produce the passion, there is requir'd some other emotion, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas may set these principles in action, and bestow on them their first impulse. This situation is still more remarkable with regard to the appetite of generation. Sex is not only the object, but also the cause of the appetite. We not only turn our view to it, when actuated by that appetite; but the reflecting on it suffices to excite the appetite. But as this cause loses its force by too great frequency, 'tis necessary it shou'd be quicken'd by some new impulse; and that impulse we find to arise from the <i class="calibre10">beauty</i> of the <i class="calibre10">person</i>; that is, from a double relation of impressions and ideas. Since this double relation is necessary where an affection has both a distinct cause, and object, how much more so, where it has only a distinct object, without any determinate cause?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这也可以从另一个角度说明我所坚持的关于骄傲和谦卑、爱和恨的起源，我已经注意到，尽管自己是第一组激情的对象，其他一些人是第二组激情的对象，但这些对象不能单独成为激情的原因；因为它们各自与两种相反的情感有关，它们必须从一开始就相互摧毁。这就是我已经描述过的心灵的情况。它的某些器官自然适合于产生一种激情；这种激情一旦产生，就会自然地把视线转向某个对象。但这还不足以产生激情，还需要一些其他的情感，通过印象和观念的双重关系，使这些原则发挥作用，并给予它们最初的推动力。这种情况在生成的欲望方面更为突出。性不仅是食欲的对象，也是食欲的原因。当我们被这种食欲所驱使时，我们不仅把目光转向它；而且对它的思考也足以激发食欲。但是，由于这种原因由于过于频繁而失去了力量，因此有必要通过某种新的推动力来加速它；我们发现这种推动力来自于<i class="calibre10">人</i>的<i class="calibre10">美</i>；也就是说，来自于印象和观念的双重关系。既然这种双重关系在一种感情有明确的原因和对象的情况下是必要的，那么在它只有一个明确的对象而没有任何确定的原因的情况下，就更有必要了。</p></div>

'Tis their constant union alone, with which we are acquainted; and 'tis from the constant union the necessity arises. If objects had not an uniform and regular conjunction with each other, we shou'd never arrive at any idea of cause and effect; and even after all, the necessity, which enters into that idea, is nothing but a determination of the mind to pass from one object to its usual attendant, and infer the existence of one from that of the other. Here then are two particulars, which we are to consider as essential to necessity, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the constant <i class="calibre10">union</i> and the <i class="calibre10">inference</i> of the mind; and wherever we discover these we must acknowledge a necessity. As the actions of matter have no necessity, but what is deriv'd from these circumstances, and it is not by any insight into the essence of bodies we discover their connexion, the absence of this insight, while the union and inference remain, will never, in any case, remove the necessity. 'Tis the observation of the union, which produces the inference; for which reason it might be thought sufficient, if we prove a constant union in the actions of the mind, in order to establish the inference, along with the necessity of these actions. But that I may bestow a greater force on my reasoning, I shall examine these particulars apart, and shall first prove from my experience, that our actions have a constant union with our motives, tempers, and circumstances, before I consider the inferences we draw from it.</p>

When any phænomena are constantly and invariably conjoin'd together, they acquire such a connexion in the imagination, that it passes from one to the other, without any doubt or hesitation. But below this there are many inferior degrees of evidence and probability, nor does one single contrariety of experiment entirely destroy all our reasoning. The mind balances the contrary experiments, and deducting the inferior from the superior, proceeds with that degree of assurance or evidence, which remains. Even when these contrary experiments are entirely equal, we remove not the notion of causes and necessity; but supposing that the usual contrariety proceeds from the operation of contrary and conceal'd causes, we conclude, that the chance or indifference lies only in our judgment on account of our imperfect knowledge, not in the things themselves, which are in every case equally necessary, tho' to appearance not equally constant or certain. No union can be more constant and certain, than that of some actions with some motives and characters; and if in other cases the union is uncertain, 'tis no more than what happens in the operations of body, nor can we conclude any thing from the one irregularity, which will not follow equally from the other.</p>

The same kind of reasoning runs thro' politics, war, commerce, economy, and indeed mixes itself so entirely in human life, that 'tis impossible to act or subsist a moment without having recourse to it. A prince, who imposes a tax upon his subjects, expects their compliance. A general, who conducts an army, makes account of a certain degree of courage. A merchant looks for fidelity and skill in his factor or super-cargo. A man, who gives orders for his dinner, doubts not of the obedience of his servants.

		<p class="block_6 cn">我相信我们可以为自由学说的盛行归纳出以下三个原因，无论它在某种意义上是多么荒谬，在其他方面是多么令人难以理解。首先，在我们采取任何行动之后，尽管我们承认我们受到了特殊观点和动机的影响，但我们很难说服自己，我们是被必然性所支配的，而且我们完全不可能采取其他行动；必然性的概念似乎意味着某种力量、暴力和约束，而这些我们都不知道。很少有人能够区分学校里所说的自<i class="calibre10">发的</i>自由和<i class="calibre10">漠不关心</i>的自由；区分与暴力相对的自由和意味着否定必然性和原因的自由。前者甚至是这个词最普通的含义；由于这只是我们要保护的那种自由，我们的想法主要是转向它，而且几乎普遍地将它与另一种自由混为一谈。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, there is a <i class="calibre10">false sensation or experience</i> even of the liberty of indifference; which is regarded as an argument for its real existence. The necessity of any action, whether of matter or of the mind, is not properly a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may consider the action, and consists in the determination of his thought to infer its existence from some preceding objects: As liberty or chance, on the other hand, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain looseness, which we feel in passing or not passing from the idea of one to that of the other. Now we may observe, that tho' in reflecting on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indifference, yet it very commonly happens, that in performing the actions themselves we are sensible of something like it: And as all related or resembling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employ'd as a demonstrative or even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing; because when by a denial of it we are provok'd to try, we feel that it moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself even on that side, on which it did not settle. This image or faint motion, we perswade ourselves, cou'd have been compleated into the thing itself; because, shou'd that be deny'd, we find, upon a second trial, that it can. But these efforts are all in vain; and whatever capricious and irregular actions we may perform; as the desire of showing our liberty is the sole motive of our actions; we can never free ourselves from the bonds of necessity. We may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves; but a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，甚至对冷漠的自由也有一种<i class="calibre10">虚假的感觉或体验</i>；这被视为其真实存在的论据。任何行动的必要性，无论是物质的还是心灵的，都不应该是代理人的品质，而应该是任何有思想或有智慧的人的品质，他可以考虑这个行动，包括他的思想决心，从一些先前的对象推断它的存在。另一方面，自由或偶然，只不过是缺乏这种决心，以及某种松散性，我们在从一个概念到另一个概念的过程中感到或不感到。现在我们可以看到，虽然在思考人类行为时，我们很少感觉到这种松散或冷漠，但在执行行为本身时，我们通常会感觉到类似的情况。由于所有相关或相似的对象都很容易被认为是彼此的，这被用作人类自由的证明，甚至是直观的证明。我们感到我们的行为在大多数情况下都受制于我们的意志，并且想象我们感到意志本身不受制于任何东西；因为当我们通过否定它而被激起尝试时，我们感到它很容易在每一个方面移动，并且甚至在它没有定居的那一面产生它的形象。我们说服自己，这种形象或微弱的运动，本来是可以完成到事物本身的；因为，如果否认了这一点，我们在第二次试验时发现，它可以。但是，这些努力都是徒劳的；无论我们采取什么任性和不规则的行动，由于展示我们的自由的愿望是我们行动的唯一动机，我们永远无法从必然性的束缚中解放出来。我们可以想象自己内心的自由；但旁观者通常可以从我们的动机和性格中推断出我们的行为；即使他不能推断，他也会得出一般结论，如果他完全了解我们的情况和脾气的每一种情况，以及我们的肤色和性格的最隐秘的根源，他就可以推断出。根据前面的学说，这就是必要性的本质。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">A third reason why the doctrine of liberty has generally been better receiv'd in the world, than its antagonist, proceeds from <i class="calibre10">religion</i>, which has been very unnecessarily interested in this question. There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical debates to endeavour to refute any hypothesis by a pretext of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads us into absurdities, 'tis certainly false; but 'tis not certain an opinion is false, because 'tis of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be foreborn, as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general, without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I submit myself frankly to an examination of this kind, and dare venture to affirm, that the doctrine of necessity, according to my explication of it, is not only innocent, but even advantageous to religion and morality.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">自由学说在世界范围内通常比它的对立面更受欢迎的第三个原因来自于<i class="calibre10">宗教</i>，<i class="calibre10">宗教</i>在这个问题上的兴趣是非常不必要的。在哲学辩论中，没有什么推理方法比以其对宗教和道德的危险后果为借口努力驳斥任何假设更常见，但也没有什么更可指责的。当任何观点把我们引向荒谬时，它肯定是错误的；但并不确定一个观点是错误的，因为它有危险的后果。因此，这种话题应该完全被排除在外，因为它无助于发现真理，而只是让反对者的人感到厌恶。我一般都是这样观察的，但并不假装从中得到任何好处。我坦率地接受这种审查，并敢于肯定，根据我对它的解释，必然性的学说不仅是无害的，甚至对宗教和道德都是有利的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I define necessity two ways, conformable to the two definitions of <i class="calibre10">cause</i>, of which it makes an essential part. I place it either in the constant union and conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the mind from the one to the other. Now necessity, in both these senses, has universally, tho' tacitely, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allow'd to belong to the will of man, and no one has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those inferences are founded on the experience'd union of like actions with like motives and circumstances. The only particular in which any one can differ from me, is either, that perhaps he will refuse to call this necessity. But as long as the meaning is understood, I hope the word can do no harm. Or that he will maintain there is something else in the operations of matter. Now whether it be so or not is of no consequence to religion, whatever it may be to natural philosophy. I may be mistaken in asserting, that we have no idea of any other connexion in the actions of body, and shall be glad to be farther instructed on that head: But sure I am, I ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind, but what must readily be allow'd of. Let no one, therefore, put an invidious construction on my words, by saying simply, that I assert the necessity of human actions, and place them on the same footing with the operations of senseless matter. I do not ascribe to the will that unintelligible necessity, which is suppos'd to lie in matter. But I ascribe to matter, that intelligible quality, call it necessity or not, which the most rigorous orthodoxy does or must allow to belong to the will. I change, therefore, nothing in the receiv'd systems, with regard to the will, but only with regard to material objects.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我给必要性下了两个定义，与<i class="calibre10">原因</i>的两个定义相一致，它是<i class="calibre10">原因</i>的一个重要组成部分。我把它放在同类物体的不断结合和联结中，或者放在心灵从一个到另一个的推论中。现在，必要性，在这两种意义上，在学校、讲坛和普通生活中，都普遍地、默许地被认为属于人的意志，而且没有人假装否认，我们可以对人的行为进行推论，而这些推论是建立在类似行为与类似动机和情况的经验结合上的。任何人唯一能与我不同的地方是，也许他拒绝称这种必要性。但只要能理解其含义，我希望这个词不会有什么危害。或者，他将坚持认为在物质的运作中还有别的东西。现在，无论是否如此，对宗教来说都没有任何意义，不管它对自然哲学有什么意义。我可能错误地断言，我们在身体的行动中没有任何其他的联系，并且很高兴在这个问题上得到进一步的指导。但我确信，我没有把任何东西归于心灵的行动，而是归于必须轻易允许的东西。因此，任何人都不要对我的话进行恶意的解释，简单地说，我断言人类行为的必要性，并把它们与无知觉的物质的运作放在同样的地位上。我并没有把那种无法理解的必然性归于意志，这种必然性被认为是存在于物质之中。但我把最严格的正统观念所允许的或必须允许的属于意志的那种可理解的品质归于物质，不管它是否为必然性，都是如此。因此，我没有改变应收制度中关于意志的内容，而只是改变了关于物质对象的内容。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nay I shall go farther, and assert, that this kind of necessity is so essential to religion and morality, that without it there must ensue an absolute subversion of both, and that every other supposition is entirely destructive to all laws both <i class="calibre10">divine</i> and <i class="calibre10">human</i>. 'Tis indeed certain, that as all human laws are founded on rewards and punishments, 'tis suppos'd as a fundamental principle, that these motives have an influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but as 'tis usually conjoin'd with the action, common sense requires it shou'd be esteem'd a cause, and be look'd upon as an instance of that necessity, which I wou'd establish.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This reasoning is equally solid, when apply'd to <i class="calibre10">divine</i> laws, so far as the deity is consider'd as a legislator, and is suppos'd to indict punishment and bestow rewards with a design to produce obedience. But I also maintain, that even where he acts not in his magisterial capacity, but is regarded as the avenger of crimes merely on account of their odiousness and deformity, not only 'tis impossible, without the necessary connexion of cause and effect in human actions, that punishments cou'd be inflicted compatible with justice and moral equity; but also that it cou'd ever enter into the thoughts of any reasonable being to indict them. The constant and universal object of hatred or anger is a person or creature endow'd with thought and consciousness; and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion, 'tis only by their relation to the person or connexion with him. But according to the doctrine of liberty or chance, this connexion is reduc'd to nothing, nor are men more accountable for those actions, which are design'd and premeditated, than for such as are the most casual and accidental. Actions are by their very nature temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in the characters and disposition of the person, who perform'd them, they infix not themselves upon him, and can neither redound to his honour, if good, nor infamy, if evil. The action itself may be blameable; it may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion: But the person is not responsible for it; and as it proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable or constant, and leaves nothing of that nature behind it, 'tis impossible he can, upon its account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. According to the hypothesis of liberty, therefore, a man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the most horrid crimes, as at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character any way concern'd in his actions; since they are not deriv'd from it, and the wickedness of the one can never be us'd as a proof of the depravity of the other. 'Tis only upon the principles of necessity, that a person acquires any merit or demerit from his actions, however the common opinion may incline to the contrary.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这一推理在适用于<i class="calibre10">神</i>的法律时也同样站得住脚，因为神被认为是立法者，并被认为是以产生服从为目的而宣布惩罚和给予奖励。但我也认为，即使在他不以立法者的身份行事，而仅仅因为罪行的可憎和畸形而被视为复仇者的情况下，如果没有人类行为中必要的因果关系，不仅不可能实施符合正义和道德公平的惩罚，而且也不可能进入任何有理智的人的想法中去谴责他们。仇恨或愤怒的恒定和普遍的对象是具有思想和意识的人或生物；当任何犯罪或伤害性行为激起这种激情时，只是由于它们与人的关系或与人的关系。但根据自由或偶然的学说，这种联系被削减为零，人对那些设计和预谋的行为的责任，也比对那些最偶然和意外的行为的责任更大。行为就其本质而言是暂时的和消亡的；如果它们不是来自于实施行为的人的性格和性情中的某些原因，它们就不会影响到他自己，而且如果是好的，也不能使他获得荣誉，如果是坏的，也不能使他蒙羞。行为本身可能是可责备的；它可能违背了所有的道德和宗教规则。但是，这个人并不对它负责；而且，由于它不是从他身上发出来的，不是持久的或恒定的，也没有留下那种性质的东西，因此，他不可能因为它而成为惩罚或报复的对象。因此，根据自由的假设，一个人在犯了最可怕的罪行之后，就像他刚出生时一样纯洁无瑕，他的性格也不会与他的行为有任何关系；因为它们不是由它衍生出来的，一个人的邪恶永远不能作为另一个人堕落的证据。只有在必要的原则下，一个人才能从他的行为中获得任何优点或缺点，无论普通人的意见如何倾向于相反。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But so inconsistent are men with themselves, that tho' they often assert, that necessity utterly destroys all merit and demerit either towards mankind or superior powers, yet they continue still to reason upon these very principles of necessity in all their judgments concerning this matter. Men are not blam'd for such evil actions as they perform ignorantly and casually, whatever may be their consequences. Why? but because the causes of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them alone. Men are less blam'd for such evil actions, as they perform hastily and unpremeditately, than for such as proceed from thought and deliberation. For what reason? but because a hasty temper, tho' a constant cause in the mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every crime, especially if attended with an evident reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for? But by asserting that actions render a person criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal passions or principles in the mind; and when by any alteration of these principles they cease to be just proofs, they likewise cease to be criminal.

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，人与自己是如此的不一致，尽管他们经常断言，必然性完全摧毁了对人类或高级力量的所有优点和缺点，但他们在有关这一问题的所有判断中仍然继续根据这些必然性的原则进行推理。人不应该为他们无知和随意的邪恶行为负责，无论其后果如何。因为这些行为的原因只是一时的，而且只在他们身上终止。人对这种仓促和无预谋的恶行的责备，比对这种经过思考和深思熟虑的恶行的责备要少。因为匆忙的脾气虽然在头脑中是一个持续的原因，但只在间隔时间内起作用，并不影响整个性格。另外，悔改可以消除所有的罪行，特别是如果伴随着明显的生活和行为的改革。这一点该如何解释呢？我们可以断言，行为使一个人成为罪犯，只是因为它们是头脑中犯罪激情或原则的证明；而当这些原则发生任何改变时，它们就不再是公正的证明，它们也不再是罪犯。但根据<i class="calibre10">自由</i>或<i class="calibre10">机会</i>的学说，它们从来不是公正的证据，因此也从来不是犯罪。</p></div>

Every rational creature, 'tis said, is oblig'd to regulate his actions by reason; and if any other motive or principle challenge the direction of his conduct, he ought to oppose it, 'till it be entirely subdu'd, or at least brought to a conformity with that superior principle. On this method of thinking the greatest part of moral philosophy, ancient and modern, seems to be founded; nor is there an ampler field, as well for metaphysical arguments, as popular declamations, than this suppos'd pre-eminence of reason above passion. The eternity, invariableness, and divine origin of the former have been display'd to the best advantage: The blindness, inconstancy, and deceitfulness of the latter have been as strongly insisted on. In order to shew the fallacy of all this philosophy, I shall endeavour to prove <i class="calibre10">first</i>, that reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will; and <i class="calibre10">secondly</i>, that it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will.</p>

I believe it scarce will be asserted, that the first species of reasoning alone is ever the cause of any action. As it's proper province is the world of ideas, and as the will always places us in that of realities, demonstration and volition seem, upon that account, to be totally remov'd, from each other. Mathematics, indeed, are useful in all mechanical operations, and arithmetic in almost every art and profession: But 'tis not of themselves they have any influence. Mechanics are the art of regulating the motions of bodies <i class="calibre10">to some design'd end or purpose</i>; and the reason why we employ arithmetic in fixing the proportions of numbers, is only that we may discover the proportions of their influence and operation. A merchant is desirous of knowing the sum total of his accounts with any person: Why? but that he may learn what sum will have the same <i class="calibre10">effects</i> in paying his debt, and going to market, as all the particular articles taken together.

'Tis also obvious, that this emotion rests not here, but making us cast our view on every side, comprehends whatever objects are connected with its original one by the relation of cause and effect. Here then reasoning takes place to discover this relation; and according as our reasoning varies, our actions receive a subsequent variation. But 'tis evident in this case, that the impulse arises not from reason, but is only directed by it. 'Tis from the prospect of pain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises towards any object: And these emotions extend themselves to the causes and effects of that object, as they are pointed out to us by reason and experience. It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects be indifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give them any influence; and 'tis plain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us.</p>

This consequence is necessary. 'Tis impossible reason cou'd have the latter effect of preventing volition, but by giving an impulse in a contrary direction to our passion; and that impulse, had it operated alone, wou'd have been able to produce volition. Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion, but a contrary impulse; and if this contrary impulse ever arises from reason, that latter faculty must have an original influence on the will, and must be able to cause, as well as hinder any act of volition. But if reason has no original influence, 'tis impossible it can withstand any principle, which has such an efficacy, or ever keep the mind in suspence a moment. Thus it appears, that the principle, which opposes our passion, cannot be the same with reason, and is only call'd so in an improper sense. We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.

According to this principle, which is so obvious and natural, 'tis only in two senses, that any affection can be call'd unreasonable. First, When a passion, such as hope or fear, grief or joy, despair or security, is founded on the supposition of the existence of objects, which really do not exist. Secondly, When in exerting any passion in action, we chuse means insufficient for the design'd end, and deceive ourselves in our judgment of causes and effects. Where a passion is neither founded on false suppositions, nor chuses means insufficient for the end, the understanding can neither justify nor condemn it. 'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. 'Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an <i class="calibre10">Indian</i> or person wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledge'd lesser good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than the latter. A trivial good may, from certain circumstances, produce a desire superior to what arises from the greatest and most valuable enjoyment; nor is there any thing more extraordinary in this, than in mechanics to see one pound weight raise up a hundred by the advantage of its situation. In short, a passion must be accompany'd with some false judgment, in order to its being unreasonable; and even then 'tis not the passion, properly speaking, which is unreasonable, but the judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这个问题上，最初可能出现的情况是，由于没有任何东西可以违背真理或理性，除非是与之相关的东西，而我们的理解力的判断只具有这种参考意义，因此，必须得出结论，激情只有在<i class="calibre10">伴随着</i>某种判断或意见的情况下才可能违背理性。根据这一明显而自然的原则，只有在两种情况下，任何感情都可以被称为不合理的。第一，当一种激情，如希望或恐惧，悲伤或快乐，绝望或安全，是建立在假设对象存在的基础上，而这些对象实际上并不存在。第二，当我们在行动中发挥任何激情时，选择的手段不足以达到设计的目的，并在对原因和结果的判断中欺骗自己。如果一种激情既没有建立在错误的假设上，也没有使用不足以达到目的的手段，那么理解力既不能证明它的正当性，也不能谴责它。宁愿毁灭整个世界，也不愿意抓挠我的手指，这并不违背理智。我宁可自己完全毁灭，也要防止一个完全不认识的<i class="calibre10">印第安人</i>或人的最低限度的不安，这并不违背理智。我甚至宁愿选择我自己承认的较小的利益，也不愿意选择较大的利益，并且对前者比后者有更强烈的感情，这也是不违背道理的。在某些情况下，一个微不足道的好处可能会产生一种欲望，超过从最大和最有价值的享受中产生的欲望；也没有任何事情比机械地看到一磅重物因其位置的优势而提升到一百磅更特别。简而言之，一种激情必须伴随着一些错误的判断，才是不合理的；即使如此，正确地说，不合理的也不是激情，而是判断。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The consequences are evident. Since a passion can never, in any sense, be call'd unreasonable, but when founded on a false supposition, or when it chuses means insufficient for the design'd end, 'tis impossible, that reason and passion can ever oppose each other, or dispute for the government of the will and actions. The moment we perceive the falshood of any supposition, or the insufficiency of any means our passions yield to our reason without any opposition. I may desire any fruit as of an excellent relish; but whenever you convince me of my mistake, my longing ceases. I may will the performance of certain actions as means of obtaining any desir'd good; but as my willing of these actions is only secondary, and founded on the supposition, that they are causes of the propos'd effect; as soon as I discover the falshood of that supposition, they must become indifferent to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">其后果是显而易见的。由于激情在任何意义上都不能被称为不合理，但当它建立在一个错误的假设上时，或者当它使用的手段不足以达到设计的目的时，理性和激情就不可能相互对立，或者为管理意志和行动而争论。当我们意识到任何假设的错误或任何手段的不足时，我们的激情就会屈服于我们的理性，而不会有任何异议。我可以把任何果实当作一种极好的美味来渴望；但只要你让我相信我的错误，我的渴望就会停止。我可以将某些行为作为获得任何期望的好处的手段；但由于我对这些行为的意愿只是次要的，而且是建立在它们是所提议的结果的原因这一假设之上的；一旦我发现这一假设是错误的，它们对我就必须变得无动于衷。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis natural for one, that does not examine objects with a strict philosophic eye, to imagine, that those actions of the mind are entirely the same, which produce not a different sensation, and are not immediately distinguishable to the feeling and perception. Reason, for instance, exerts itself without producing any sensible emotion; and except in the more sublime disquisitions of philosophy, or in the frivolous subtilties of the schools, scarce ever conveys any pleasure or uneasiness. Hence it proceeds, that every action of the mind, which operates with the same calmness and tranquillity, is confounded with reason by all those, who judge of things from the first view and appearance. Now 'tis certain, there are certain calm desires and tendencies, which, tho' they be real passions, produce little emotion in the mind, and are more known by their effects than by the immediate feeling or sensation. These desires are of two kinds; either certain instincts originally implanted in our natures, such as benevolence and resentment, the love of life, and kindness to children; or the general appetite to good, and aversion to evil, consider'd merely as such. When any of these passions are calm, and cause no disorder in the soul, they are very readily taken for the determinations of reason, and are suppos'd to proceed from the same faculty, with that, which judges of truth and falshood. Their nature and principles have been suppos'd the same, because their sensations are not evidently different.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对于一个不以严格的哲学眼光审视对象的人来说，自然会想象，那些心灵的行动是完全一样的，它们不会产生不同的感觉，也不会立即被感觉和知觉所区分。比如说，理性发挥自己的作用时，并不产生任何可感的情绪；除了在哲学的更崇高的讨论中，或在学校的轻浮的狡辩中，很少有任何快乐或不安的表现。因此，每一个以同样的平静和安宁运作的心灵行动，都被所有那些从第一视角和外表判断事物的人与理性相混淆。现在可以肯定的是，有一些平静的欲望和倾向，尽管它们是真正的激情，但在头脑中产生的情感很少，而且更多的是通过其效果而不是通过直接的感觉或感受来了解。这些欲望有两种：一种是最初植入我们天性的某些本能，如仁慈和怨恨，对生命的热爱和对儿童的仁慈；另一种是对善的普遍渴望和对恶的厌恶，仅仅被认为是这样。当这些激情中的任何一种是平静的，并且没有在灵魂中造成混乱时，它们很容易被认为是理性的决定，并且被认为是来自于同一种能力，即判断真理和谬误的能力。它们的性质和原则被认为是一样的，因为它们的感觉没有明显的不同。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Beside these calm passions, which often determine the will, there are certain violent emotions of the same kind, which have likewise a great influence on that faculty. When I receive any injury from another, I often feel a violent passion of resentment, which makes me desire his evil and punishment, independent of all considerations of pleasure and advantage to myself. When I am immediately threaten'd with any grievous ill, my fears, apprehensions, and aversions rise to a great height, and produce a sensible emotion. The common error of metaphysicians has lain in ascribing the direction of the will entirely to one of these principles, and supposing the other to have no influence. Men often act knowingly against their interest: For which reason the view of the greatest possible good does not always influence them. Men often counter-act a violent passion in prosecution of their interests and designs: 'Tis not therefore the present uneasiness alone, which determines them. In general we may observe, that both these principles operate on the will; and where they are contrary, that either of them prevails, according to the <i class="calibre10">general</i> character or <i class="calibre10">present</i> disposition of the person. What we call strength of mind, implies the prevalence of the calm passions above the violent; tho' we may easily observe, there is no man so constantly possess'd of this virtue, as never on any occasion to yield to the solicitations of passion and desire. From these variations of temper proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning the actions and resolutions of men, where there is any contrariety of motives and passions.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">除了这些经常决定意志的平静的激情之外，还有一些同类的剧烈情绪，它们同样对这种能力有很大的影响。当我受到他人的任何伤害时，我常常感到一种强烈的怨恨的激情，这使我渴望他的邪恶和惩罚，而不考虑所有的快乐和对自己的好处。当我立即受到任何严重疾病的威胁时，我的恐惧、忧虑和厌恶就会上升到一个很高的高度，并产生一种感性的情绪。形而上学者的常见错误在于把意志的方向完全归于这些原则中的一个，而认为另一个没有影响。人的行为往往是明知故犯的，违背自己的利益。因此，对最大可能的利益的看法并不总是影响他们。人们在追求自己的利益和计划时，常常会反击一种激烈的激情。因此，决定他们的并不只是目前的不安。一般来说，我们可以观察到，这两种原则都在意志上起作用；而在它们相反的地方，根据人的<i class="calibre10">一般</i>性格或<i class="calibre10">目前的</i>倾向，其中任何一种都占优势。我们所说的精神力量，意味着平静的激情高于暴力的激情；尽管我们可以很容易地观察到，没有一个人经常拥有这种美德，在任何场合都不会屈服于激情和欲望的诱惑。从这些脾气的变化中可以看出，在动机和激情不一致的情况下，对人的行为和决议进行判断是非常困难的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is not in philosophy a subject of more nice speculation than this of the different <i class="calibre10">causes</i> and <i class="calibre10">effects</i> of the calm and violent passions. 'Tis evident passions influence not the will in proportion to their violence, or the disorder they occasion in the temper; but on the contrary, that when a passion has once become a settled principle of action, and is the predominant inclination of the soul, it commonly produces no longer any sensible agitation. As repeated custom and its own force have made every thing yield to it, it directs the actions and conduct without that opposition and emotion, which so naturally attend every momentary gust of passion. We must, therefore, distinguish betwixt a calm and a weak passion; betwixt a violent and a strong one. But notwithstanding this, 'tis certain, that when we wou'd govern a man, and push him to any action, 'twill commonly be better policy to work upon the violent than the calm passions, and rather take him by his inclination, than what is vulgarly call'd his reason. We ought to place the object in such particular situations as are proper to encrease the violence of the passion. For we may observe, that all depends upon the situation of the object, and that a variation in this particular will be able to change the calm and the violent passions into each other. Both these kinds of passions pursue good, and avoid evil; and both of them are encreas'd or diminish'd by the encrease or diminution of the good or evil. But herein lies the difference betwixt them: The same good, when near, will cause a violent passion, which, when remote, produces only a calm one. As this subject belongs very properly to the present question conceding the will, we shall here examine it to the bottom, and shall consider some of those circumstances and situations of objects, which render a passion either calm or violent.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在哲学中，没有比平静和剧烈的激情的不同<i class="calibre10">原因</i>和<i class="calibre10">影响</i>这一主题更美好的猜测了。显然，激情对意志的影响并不与它们的暴力或它们在脾气中造成的混乱相称；相反，当一种激情一旦成为行动的固定原则，成为灵魂的主要倾向时，它通常不再产生任何明显的躁动。由于反复的习惯和它自身的力量使每一件事都向它屈服，它指导着人们的行动和行为，而没有那种反对和情绪，而这种反对和情绪又是那么自然地伴随着每一个瞬间的激情。因此，我们必须区分平静的和软弱的激情；暴力的和强烈的激情。但尽管如此，可以肯定的是，当我们要管理一个人，并推动他采取任何行动时，通常情况下，对暴力的激情而不是平静的激情进行管理是更好的政策，宁可利用他的倾向，也不要利用俗称的理性。我们应该把目标放在适当的情况下，以增加激情的暴力。因为我们可以看到，一切都取决于对象的情况，而这种情况的变化能够使平静的激情和暴力的激情相互转化。这两种激情都追求善，避免恶；它们都因善或恶的增加或减少而增加或减少。但它们之间的区别就在这里。同样的善，当它靠近时，会引起剧烈的激情，而当它远离时，只会产生平静的激情。由于这个问题属于目前承认意志的问题，我们将在这里对其进行深入研究，并将考虑那些使激情变得平静或暴力的情况和对象的情况。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis a remarkable property of human nature, that any emotion, which attends a passion, is easily converted into it, tho' in their natures they be originally different from, and even contrary to each other. 'Tis true; in order to make a perfect union among passions, there is always requir'd a double relation of impressions and ideas; nor is one relation sufficient for that purpose. But tho' this be confirm'd by undoubted experience, we must understand it with its proper limitations, and must regard the double relation, as requisite only to make one passion produce another. When two passions are already produc'd by their separate causes, and are both present in the mind, they readily mingle and unite, tho' they have but one relation, and sometimes without any. The predominant passion swallows up the inferior, and converts it into itself. The spirits, when once excited, easily receive a change in their direction; and 'tis natural to imagine this change will come from the prevailing affection. The connexion is in many respects closer betwixt any two passions, than betwixt any passion and indifference.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">人性的一个显著特点是，任何伴随着激情的情感都很容易转化为激情，尽管它们的本性原本是不同的，甚至是相反的。这是真的；为了在各种激情之间实现完美的结合，总是需要一种印象和观念的双重关系；一种关系也不足以达到这个目的。但是，尽管这一点被毋庸置疑的经验所证实，我们必须以其适当的局限性来理解它，并且必须将双重关系视为只为使一种激情产生另一种激情所必需的。当两种激情已经由它们各自的原因产生，并同时存在于头脑中时，它们很容易混合并结合在一起，尽管它们只有一种关系，有时甚至没有任何关系。主导的激情吞噬了次要的激情，并将其转化为自身。精神一旦被激发，就很容易接受其方向的改变；而且很自然地想象这种改变会来自于主导的感情。在许多方面，任何两种激情之间的联系都比任何激情和冷漠之间的联系更密切。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">When a person is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprice of his mistress, the jealousies and quarrels, to which that commerce is so subject; however unpleasant and related to anger and hatred; are yet found to give additional force to the prevailing passion. 'Tis a common artifice of politicians, when they wou'd affect any person very much by a matter of fact, of which they intend to inform him, first to excite his curiosity; delay as long as possible the satisfying it; and by that means raise his anxiety and impatience to the utmost, before they give him a full insight into the business. They know that his curiosity will precipitate him into the passion they design to raise, and assist the object in its influence on the mind. A soldier advancing to the battle, is naturally inspir'd with courage and confidence, when he thinks on his friends and fellow-soldiers; and is struck with fear and terror, when he reflects on the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore, proceeds from the former naturally encreases the courage; as the same emotion, proceeding from the latter, augments the fear; by the relation of ideas, and the conversion of the inferior emotion into the predominant. Hence it is that in martial discipline, the uniformity and lustre of our habit, the regularity of our figures and motions, with ah the pomp and majesty of war, encourage ourselves and allies; while the same objects in the enemy strike terror into us, tho' agreeable and beautiful in themselves.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since passions, however independent, are naturally transfus'd into each other, if they are both present at the same time; it follows, that when good or evil is plac'd in such a situation, as to cause any particular emotion, beside its direct passion of desire or aversion, that latter passion must acquire new force and violence.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">由于激情，无论多么独立，如果它们同时存在，就会自然而然地相互转化；因此，当善或恶被放置在这样一种情况下，以引起任何特定的情感，除了其直接的欲望或厌恶的激情之外，后一种激情必须获得新的力量和暴力。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This happens, among other cases, whenever any object excites contrary passions. For 'tis observable that an opposition of passions commonly causes a new emotion in the spirits, and produces more disorder, than the concurrence of any two affections of equal force. This new emotion is easily converted into the predominant passion, and encreases its violence, beyond the pitch it wou'd have arriv'd at had it met with no opposition. Hence we naturally desire what is forbid, and take a pleasure in performing actions, merely because they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when opposite to the passions, is seldom able to overcome them; and when it fails of that effect, is apt rather to encrease them, by producing an opposition in our motives and principles.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在其他情况下，只要任何物体激起相反的激情，就会发生这种情况。因为可以看到，激情的对立通常会在精神上引起一种新的情绪，并产生更多的混乱，而不是任何两种同等力量的情感的结合。这种新的情绪很容易转化为主导的激情，并增加其暴力程度，超过它在没有遇到反对时本应达到的程度。因此，我们自然而然地渴望被禁止的东西，并在执行行动时感到高兴，只因为它们是非法的。当责任的概念与激情相对时，很少能够克服它们；当它不能产生这种效果时，反而会通过在我们的动机和原则中产生对立而增加它们。</p></div>

Hence every thing, that is new, is most affecting, and gives us either more pleasure or pain, than what, strictly speaking, naturally belongs to it.

One can consider the clouds, and heavens, and trees, an stones, however frequently repeated, without ever feeling any aversion. But when the fair sex, or music, or good cheer, or any thing, that naturally ought to be agreeable, becomes indifferent, it easily produces the opposite affection.</p>

The facility takes off from the force of the passive habits by rendering the motion of the spirits faint and languid.

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis remarkable, that the imagination and affections have a close union together, and that nothing, which affects the former, can be entirely indifferent to the latter. Wherever our ideas of good or evil acquire a new vivacity, the passions become more violent; and keep pace with the imagination in all its variations. Whether this proceeds from the principle above-mention'd, <i class="calibre10">that any attendant emotion is easily converted into the predominant</i>, I shall not determine.

A general idea, tho' it be nothing but a particular one consider'd in a certain view, is commonly more obscure; and that because particular idea, by which we represent a general one, is ever fix'd or determinate, but may easily be chang'd for other particular ones, which will serve equally in the representation.</p>

Here, says he, <i class="calibre10">they are not philosophers, to whom 'tis easy in their schools to establish the finest maxims and most sublime rules of morality, who decide that interest ought never to prevail above justice.

The same reasons, which render it so easy for philosophers to establish these sublime maxims, tend, in part, to diminish the merit of such a conduct in that people. Philosophers never ballance betwixt profit and honesty, because their decisions are general, and neither their passions nor imaginations are interested in the objects. And tho' in the present case the advantage was immediate to the <i class="calibre10">Athenians</i>, yet as it was known only under the general notion of advantage, without being conceiv'd by any particular idea, it must have had a less considerable influence on their imaginations, and have been a less violent temptation, than if they had been acquainted with all its circumstances: Otherwise 'tis difficult to conceive, that a whole people, unjust and violent as men commonly are, shou'd so unanimously have adher'd to justice, and rejected any considerable advantage.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Any satisfaction, which we lately enjoy'd, and of which the memory is fresh and recent, operates on the will with more violence, than another of which the traces are decay'd, and almost obliterated. From whence does this proceed, but that the memory in the first case assists the fancy, and gives an additional force and vigour to its conceptions? The image of the past pleasure being strong and violent, bestows these qualities on the idea of the future pleasure, which is connected with it by the relation of resemblance. A pleasure, which is suitable to the way of life, in which we are engag'd, excites more our desires and appetites than another, which is foreign to it.

Ourself is intimately present to us, and whatever is related to self must partake of that quality. But where an object is so far remov'd as to have lost the advantage of this relation, why, as it is farther remov'd, its idea becomes still fainter and more obscure, wou'd, perhaps, require a more particular examination.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis obvious, that the imagination can never totally forget the points of space and time, in which we are existent; but receives such frequent advertisements of them from the passions and senses, that however it may turn its attention to foreign and remote objects, it is necessitated every moment to reflect on the present. 'Tis also remarkable, that in the conception of those objects, which we regard as real and existent, we take them in their proper order and situation, and never leap from one object to another, which is distant from it, without running over, at least in a cursory manner, all those objects, which are interpos'd betwixt them. When we reflect, therefore, on any object distant from ourselves, we are oblig'd not only to reach it at first by passing thro all the intermediate space betwixt ourselves and the object, but also to renew our progress every moment; being every moment recall'd to the consideration of ourselves and our present situation. 'Tis easily conceiv'd, that this interruption must weaken the idea by breaking the action of the mind, and hindering the conception from being so intense and continu'd, as when we reflect on a nearer object. The <i class="calibre10">fewer</i> steps we make to arrive at the object, and the <i class="calibre10">smoother</i> the road is, this diminution of vivacity is less sensibly felt, but still may be observ'd more or less in proportion to the degrees of distance and difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很明显，想象力永远不会完全忘记我们所处的空间和时间点；但它从激情和感官中经常收到关于这些空间和时间点的广告，因此，无论它如何将注意力转向陌生和遥远的物体，它都必须每时每刻反思现在。同样值得注意的是，在构思那些我们认为是真实存在的物体时，我们会按照适当的顺序和情况来考虑它们，而不会从一个物体跳到另一个离它很远的物体，而不去考虑，至少以粗略的方式去考虑所有那些介于它们之间的物体。因此，当我们思考任何远离自己的物体时，我们不仅要通过自己和物体之间的所有中间空间来达到它，而且还要每时每刻都要更新我们的进展；每时每刻都要考虑到我们自己和我们现在的情况。我们很容易想到，这种中断一定会削弱思想，因为它破坏了思想的行动，阻碍了概念的强烈和持续，就像我们思考一个较近的对象时一样。我们到达目标的步骤越<i class="calibre10">少</i>，道路越<i class="calibre10">平坦</i>，这种活力的减弱就越不明显，但仍可根据距离和困难的程度而或多或少地观察到。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Here then we are to consider two kinds of objects, the contiguous and remote; of which the former, by means of their relation to ourselves, approach an impression in force and vivacity; the latter by reason of the interruption in our manner of conceiving them, appear in a weaker and more imperfect light. This is their effect on the imagination. If my reasoning be just, they must have a proportion able effect on the will and passions. Contiguous objects must have an influence much superior to the distant and remote. Accordingly we find in common life, that men are principally concern'd about those objects, which are not much remov'd either in space or time, enjoying the present, and leaving what is afar off to the care of chance and fortune. Talk to a man of his condition thirty years hence, and he will not regard you. Speak of what is to happen to-morrow, and he will lend you attention. The breaking of a minor gives us more concern when at home, than the burning of a house, when abroad, and some hundred leagues distant.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这里，我们要考虑两种物体，即邻近的和遥远的；其中前者，由于它们与我们的关系，在力量和活力上接近印象；后者，由于我们对它们的设想方式的中断，在一个较弱和较不完善的光线下出现。这就是它们对想象力的影响。如果我的推理是正确的，它们对意志和激情的影响也一定是相称的。相邻的物体必须比遥远的物体有更大的影响。因此，我们发现在普通生活中，人们主要关心那些在空间或时间上相距不远的物体，享受当下，而把远处的东西留给机会和命运来照顾。跟一个人谈他三十年后的状况，他不会理会你。说到明天要发生的事情，他就会关注你。当我们在家里的时候，一个未成年人被打碎了，比在国外的时候，一个房子被烧毁了，而且是在一百英里以外的地方，更让我们担心。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But farther; tho' distance both in space and time has a considerable effect on the imagination, and by that means on the will and passions, yet the consequence of a removal in space are much inferior to those of a removal in <i class="calibre10">time</i>. Twenty years are certainly but a small distance of time in comparison of what history and even the memory of some may inform them of, and yet I doubt if a thousand leagues, or even the greatest distance of place this globe can admit o£ will so remarkably weaken our ideas, and diminish our passions. A <i class="calibre10">West-India</i> merchant will tell you, that he is not without concern about what passes in <i class="calibre10">Jamaica</i>; tho' few extend their views so far into futurity, as to dread very remote accidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但更远的是，虽然空间和时间上的距离对想象力有相当大的影响，并由此对意志和激情产生影响，但空间上的移动所带来的后果远不如<i class="calibre10">时间</i>上的移动。与历史甚至一些人的记忆相比，20年当然只是一个很小的时间距离，但我怀疑千里之外，甚至是这个地球所能容纳的最大距离，是否会如此明显地削弱我们的思想，降低我们的激情。一个<i class="calibre10">西印度</i>的商人会告诉你，他对<i class="calibre10">牙买加</i>的情况并非不关心；但很少有人会把他们的观点延伸到未来，以至于害怕非常遥远的事故。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The cause of this phænomenon must evidently lie in the different properties of space and time. Without having recourse to metaphysics, any one may easily observe, that space or extension consists of a number of co-existent parts dispos'd in a certain order, and capable of being at once present to the sight or feeling. On the contrary, time or succession, tho' it consists likewise of parts, never presents to us more than one at once; nor is it possible for any two of them ever to be co-existent. These qualities of the objects have a suitable effect on the imagination. The parts of extension being susceptible of an union to the senses, acquire an union in the fancy; and as the appearance of one part excludes not another, the transition or passage of the thought thro' the contiguous parts is by that means render'd more smooth and easy. On the other hand, the incompatibility of the parts of time in their real existence separates them in the imagination, and makes it more <i class="calibre10">difficult</i> for that faculty to trace any long succession or series of events. Every part must appear single and alone, nor an regularly have entrance into the fancy without banishing what is suppos'd to have been immediately precedent. By this means any distance in time causes a greater interruption in the thought than an equal distance in space, and consequently weakens more considerably the idea, and consequently the passions; which depend in a great measure, on the imagination, according to my system.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种现象的原因显然必须在于空间和时间的不同属性。无需求助于形而上学，任何人都可以很容易地观察到，空间或延伸是由一些按一定顺序排列的共存部分组成的，并且能够立即呈现在视觉或感觉中。相反，时间或连续，尽管它也是由部分组成的，但从来没有同时呈现给我们一个以上的部分；其中任何两个部分也不可能同时存在。物体的这些品质对想象力有适当的影响。延伸的部分在感官上容易结合，在想象中也会获得结合；由于一个部分的出现并不排斥另一个部分，思想在相邻部分的过渡或通过就会因此变得更加顺利和容易。另一方面，时间的各个部分在现实存在中的不相容性，使它们在想象中分离，并使这种能力更<i class="calibre10">难以</i>追踪任何长期的连续或系列的事件。每一个部分都必须是单一的和单独的，也没有一个定期的进入幻想，而没有驱逐被认为是紧接在前的东西。通过这种方式，时间上的任何距离都会比空间上的同等距离在思想上造成更大的中断，因此会更大幅度地削弱思想，进而削弱激情；根据我的体系，这些激情在很大程度上取决于想象力。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is another phænomenon of a like nature with the foregoing, viz. <i class="calibre10">the superior effects of the same distance in futurity above that in the past</i>. This difference with respect to the will is easily accounted for. As none of our actions can alter the past, 'tis not strange it shou'd never determine the will. But with respect to the passions the question is yet entire, and well worth the examining.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">还有一个与前述性质相似的现象，即<i class="calibre10">同一距离在未来的效果优于在过去的效果</i>。这种与意志有关的差异很容易解释。由于我们的行为都不能改变过去，所以它永远不能决定意志，这并不奇怪。但在激情方面，这个问题还很完整，而且很值得研究。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Besides the propensity to a gradual progression thro' the points of space and time, we have another peculiarity in our method of thinking, which concurs in producing this phænomenon. We always follow the succession of time in placing our ideas, and from the consideration of any object pass more easily to that, which follows immediately after it, than to that which went before it. We may learn this, among other instances, from the order, which is always observ'd in historical narrations. Nothing but an absolute necessity can oblige an historian to break the order of time, and in his <i class="calibre10">narration</i> give the precedence to an event, which was in <i class="calibre10">reality</i> posterior to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">除了在空间和时间点上有逐步推进的倾向外，我们的思维方法还有一个特点，也是产生这种现象的原因。我们在放置我们的想法时总是遵循时间的连续性，并且从对任何对象的考虑中更容易转到紧随其后的对象上，而不是转到它之前的对象上。我们可以从历史叙述中始终遵守的顺序中了解到这一点，以及其他一些例子。除了绝对的需要，没有什么能迫使历史学家打破时间的顺序，在他的<i class="calibre10">叙述</i>中给一个事件以优先权，而这个事件<i class="calibre10">实际上</i>是在另一个事件之后的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This will easily be appIy'd to the question in hand, if we reflect on what I have before observ'd, that the present situation of the person is always that of the imagination, and that 'tis from thence we proceed to the conception of any distant object. When the object is past, the progression of the thought in passing to it from the present is contrary to nature, as proceeding from one point of time to that which is preceding, and from that to another preceding, in opposition to the natural course of the succession. On the other hand, when we turn our thought to a future object, our fancy flows along the stream of time, and arrives at the object by an order, which seems most natural, passing always from one point of time to that which is immediately posterior to it. This <i class="calibre10">easy</i> progression of ideas favours the imagination, and makes it conceive its object in a stronger and fuller light, than when we are continually oppos'd in our passage, and are oblig'd to overcome the difficulties arising from the natural propensity of the fancy. A small degree of distance in the past has, therefore, a greater effect, in interrupting and weakening the conception, than a much greater in the future. From this effect of it on the imagination is deriv'd its influence on the will and passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我们思考一下我之前所观察到的，即人的目前状况总是想象中的状况，并且我们从那里开始构思任何遥远的物体，那么这就很容易适用于眼前的问题。当对象是过去的时候，思想的进展从现在开始就违背了自然，因为从一个时间点到之前的时间点，再从之前的时间点到另一个时间点，与自然的继承过程相反。另一方面，当我们把思想转向一个未来的对象时，我们的想象力沿着时间的流向流动，并以一种似乎最自然的顺序到达对象，总是从一个时间点到紧随其后的时间点。这种思想的<i class="calibre10">轻松</i>进展有利于想象力，并使它以更强大和更充分的光线来构想它的目标，而不是当我们在我们的通道中不断地对立，并不得不克服由幻想的自然倾向所产生的困难。因此，过去的一小段距离比未来的一大段距离在中断和削弱概念方面具有更大的作用。从它对想象力的这种影响，可以推导出它对意志和激情的影响。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is another cause, which both contributes to the same effect, and proceeds from the same quality of the fancy, by which we are determin'd to trace the succession of time by a similar succession of ideas. When from the present instant we consider two points of time equally distant in the future and in the past, 'tis evident, that, abstractedly consider'd, their relation to the present is almost equal. For as the future will <i class="calibre10">sometime</i> be present, so the past was <i class="calibre10">once</i> present. If we cou'd, therefore, remove this quality of the imagination, an equal distance in the past and in the future, wou'd have a similar influence. Nor is this only true, when the fancy remains fix'd, and from the present instant surveys the future and the past; but also when it changes its situation, and places us in different periods of time. For as on the one hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present instant and the future object, we find the future object approach to us, and the past retire, and become more distant: So on the other hand, in supposing ourselves existent in a point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and the past, the past approaches to us, and the future becomes more distant. But from the property of the fancy above-mention'd we rather chuse to fix our thought on the point of time interpos'd betwixt the present and the future, than on that betwixt the present and the past. We advance, rather than retard our existence; and following what seems the natural succession of time, proceed from past to present, and from present to future. By which means we conceive the future as flowing every moment nearer us, and the past as retiring. An equal distance, therefore, in the past and in the future, has not the same effect on the imagination; and that because we consider the one as continually encreasing, and the other as continually diminishing. The fancy anticipates the course of things. and surveys the object in that condition, to which it tends, as well as in that, which is regarded as the present.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">还有一个原因，它既有助于产生同样的效果，又来自于同样的幻想质量，通过这个原因，我们被确定为通过类似的观念的连续来追踪时间的连续。当我们从现在开始考虑未来和过去的两个同样遥远的时间点时，很明显，抽象地考虑，它们与现在的关系几乎是相等的。因为未来<i class="calibre10">有一天</i>会变成现在，过去也<i class="calibre10">曾经</i>是现在。因此，如果我们能够消除想象力的这一特性，过去和未来的距离相等，就会产生类似的影响。这也不仅仅是当想象力保持固定，从现在的瞬间观察未来和过去时才是真的；而且当它改变它的情况，把我们置于不同的时间段时也是如此。因为一方面，当我们假设自己存在于现在的瞬间和未来的物体之间的一个时间点时，我们发现未来的物体接近我们，而过去的物体则退去，变得更加遥远：因此另一方面，当我们假设自己存在于现在和过去之间的一个时间点时，过去的物体接近我们，而未来的物体变得更加遥远。但是，从上述幻想的特性来看，我们宁愿选择将我们的思想固定在现在和未来之间的时间点上，而不是固定在现在和过去之间的时间点上。我们推进而不是延缓我们的存在；按照时间的自然顺序，从过去到现在，又从现在到未来。通过这种方式，我们认为未来每时每刻都在向我们靠近，而过去则在退却。因此，在过去和未来有相同的距离，对想象力的影响是不一样的；这是因为我们认为一个是不断增加的，而另一个是不断减少的。幻想是对事物发展过程的预测，并在它所趋向的那个条件下，以及在被视为现在的那个条件下，对物体进行观察。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus we have accounted for three phænomena, which seem pretty remarkable. Why distance weakens the conception and passion: Why distance in time has a greater effect than that in space: And why distance in past time has still a greater effect than that in future. We must now consider three phænomena, which seem to be, in a manner, the reverse of these: Why a very great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object: Why such a distance in time encreases it more than that in space: And a distance in past time more than that in future. The curiousness of the subject will, I hope, excuse my dwelling on it for some time.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们已经解释了三个现象，这似乎是非常显著的。为什么距离会削弱概念和激情。为什么时间上的距离比空间上的距离有更大的影响。以及为什么过去的距离比未来的距离有更大的影响。我们现在必须考虑三个现象，它们在某种程度上似乎是这些现象的反面。为什么非常远的距离会增加我们对一个物体的敬意和钦佩。为什么这种时间上的距离比空间上的距离更能增加我们的敬意和钦佩。在过去的时间里的距离比在未来的时间里的距离更增加。我希望，这个问题的好奇心将使我在这个问题上停留一段时间。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the first phænomenon, why a great distance encreases our esteem and admiration for an object; 'tis evident that the mere view and contemplation of any greatness, whether successive or extended, enlarges the soul, and give it a sensible delight and pleasure. A wide plain, the ocean, eternity, a succession of several ages; all these are entertaining objects, and excel every thing, however beautiful, which accompanies not its beauty with a suitable greatness. Now when any very distant object is presented to the imagination, we naturally reflect on the interpos'd distance, and by that means, conceiving something great and magnificent, receive the usual satisfaction. But as the fancy passes easily from one idea. to another related to it, and transports to the second all the passions excited by the first, the admiration, which is directed to the distance, naturally diffuses itself over the distant object. Accordingly we find, that 'tis not necessary the object shou'd be actually distant from us, in order to cause our admiration; but that 'tis sufficient, if, by the natural association of ideas, it conveys our view to any considerable distance. A great traveller, 'tho in the same chamber, will pass for a very extraordinary person; as a <i class="calibre10">Greek</i> medal, even in our cabinet, is always esteem'd a valuable curiosity. Here the object, by a natural transition, conveys our view to the distance; and the admiration, which arises from that distance, by another natural transition, returns back to the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从第一个现象开始，为什么遥远的距离会增加我们对一个物体的尊敬和钦佩；很明显，仅仅是对任何伟大事物的观察和思考，无论是连续的还是扩展的，都会扩大灵魂，并给它带来一种明显的喜悦和快乐。广阔的平原、海洋、永恒、连续的几个时代；所有这些都是令人愉快的对象，并且超过了每一件事，不管它有多么美丽，如果没有适当的伟大来伴随它的美丽。现在，当任何非常遥远的物体呈现在想象力面前时，我们自然会思考中间的距离，并通过这种方式，设想一些伟大和宏伟的东西，得到通常的满足。但是，由于想象力很容易从一个想法转移到与之相关的另一个想法，并将第一个想法所激发的所有激情转移到第二个想法上，因此，针对距离的赞叹自然会扩散到遥远的物体上。因此，我们发现，为了引起我们的钦佩，对象不一定要离我们很远；但如果通过观念的自然联系，它能把我们的视线带到相当远的地方，那就足够了。一个伟大的旅行者，即使在同一个房间里，也会被认为是一个非常特别的人；就像一枚<i class="calibre10">希腊</i>奖章，即使在我们的橱柜里，也总是被认为是一种有价值的好奇心。在这里，物体通过一个自然的过渡，把我们的视线带到了远方；而从远方产生的钦佩之情，通过另一个自然的过渡，又回到了物体上。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' every great distance produces an admiration for the distant object, a distance in time has a more considerable effect than that in space. Antient busts and inscriptions are more valu'd than <i class="calibre10">Japan</i> tables: And not to mention the <i class="calibre10">Greeks</i> and <i class="calibre10">Romans</i>, 'tis certain we regard with more veneration the old <i class="calibre10">Chaldeans</i> and <i class="calibre10">Egyptians</i>, than the modern <i class="calibre10">Chinese</i> and <i class="calibre10">Persians</i>, and bestow more fruitless pains to clear up the history and chronology of the former, than it wou'd cost us to make a voyage, and be certainly inform'd of the character, learning and government of the latter.

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管每一个遥远的距离都会产生对遥远物体的钦佩之情，但时间上的距离比空间上的距离有更大的影响。古代的半身像和铭文比<i class="calibre10">日本的</i>桌子更受重视。且不说<i class="calibre10">希腊人</i>和<i class="calibre10">罗马人</i>，可以肯定的是，我们对古老的<i class="calibre10">迦勒底人</i>和<i class="calibre10">埃及人</i>比对现代的<i class="calibre10">中国人</i>和<i class="calibre10">波斯人</i>更怀有敬意，为弄清前者的历史和年代而付出的无益的努力，比我们进行一次远航，确切了解后者的性格、学识和政府要多得多。为了解释这一现象，我不得不说点题外话。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">These principles have an effect on the imagination as well as on the passions. To be convinc'd of this we need only consider the influence of <i class="calibre10">heights</i> and <i class="calibre10">depths</i> on that faculty. Any great elevation of place communicates a kind of pride or sublimity of imagination, and gives a fancy'd superiority over those that lie below; and, <i class="calibre10">visa versa</i>, a sublime and strong imagination conveys the idea of ascent and elevation. Hence it proceeds, that we associate, in a manner, the idea of whatever is good with that of height, and evil with lowness. Heaven is suppos'd to be above, and hell below. A noble genius is call'd an elevate and sublime one. <i class="calibre10">Atque udam spernit humum fugiente penna</i>. On the contrary, a vulgar and trivial conception is stil'd indifferently low or mean. Prosperity is denominated ascent, and adversity descent. Kings and princes are suppos'd to be plac'd at the top of human affairs; as peasants and day-labourers are said to be in the lowest stations. These methods of thinking, and of expressing ourselves, are not of so little consequence as they may appear at first sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这些原则对想象力和激情都有影响。要确信这一点，我们只需要考虑<i class="calibre10">高度</i>和<i class="calibre10">深度</i>对这种能力的影响。任何高度的地方都会传达出一种骄傲或崇高的想象力，并使人觉得比下面的地方更优越；<i class="calibre10">反之</i>，一个崇高和强大的想象力会传达出上升和升高的想法。因此，在某种程度上，我们将任何好的东西与高度联系起来，而将坏的东西与低的联系起来。天堂被认为是在上面，而地狱在下面。一个高尚的天才被称为高尚和崇高的人。<i class="calibre10">Atque udam spernit humum fugiente penna</i>.相反，一个庸俗和琐碎的概念则被称为低级或卑微。繁荣被称为上升，而逆境被称为下降。国王和王子被认为是处于人类事务的顶端；而农民和日工则被认为是处于最低的位置。这些思考和表达的方法，并不像它们乍看之下那么不重要。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis evident to common sense, as well as philosophy, that there is no natural nor essential difference betwixt high and low, and that this distinction arises only from the gravitation of matter, which produces .a motion from the one to the other. The very same direction, which in this part of the globe is call'd <i class="calibre10">ascent</i>, is denominated <i class="calibre10">descent</i> in our antipodes; which can proceed from nothing but the contrary tendency of bodies. Now 'tis certain, that the tendency of bodies, continually operating upon our senses, must produce, from custom, a like tendency in the fancy, and that when we consider any object situated in an ascent, the idea of its weight gives us a propensity to transport it from the place, in which it is situated, to the place immediately below it, and so on, till we come to the ground, which equally stops the body and our imagination. For a like reason we feel a difficulty in mounting, and pass not without a kind of reluctance from the inferior to that which is situated above it; as if our ideas acquir'd a kind of gravity from their objects. As a proof of this, do we not find, that the facility, which is so much study`d in music and poetry, is call'd the fall or cadency of the harmony or period; the idea of facility communicating to us that of descent, in the same manner as descent produces a facility?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">对常识和哲学来说，高和低之间没有自然的或本质的区别，这种区别只是源于物质的引力，它产生了从一个到另一个的运动。同样的方向，在地球的这一部分被称为<i class="calibre10">上升</i>，而在我们的反方向则被称为<i class="calibre10">下降</i>；这只能从身体的相反趋势中产生。现在可以肯定的是，身体的趋势不断地作用于我们的感官，从习惯上讲，必须在幻想中产生一种类似的趋势，当我们考虑任何物体位于上升时，它的重量的想法给了我们一种倾向，要把它从它所在的地方运到紧接着它下面的地方，以此类推，直到我们来到地面，这同样使身体和我们的想象力停止。出于同样的原因，我们在上升时感到困难，并且不无勉强地从低处走到高处；仿佛我们的观念从它们的对象中获得了一种重力。为了证明这一点，我们是不是发现，在音乐和诗歌中经常研究的设施，被称为和谐或时期的下降或节奏；设施的概念向我们传达了下降的概念，其方式与下降产生的设施相同。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since the imagination, therefore, in running from low to high, finds an opposition in its internal qualities and principles, and since the soul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it; it follows, that every thing, which invigorates and inlivens the soul, whether by touching the passions or imagination, naturally conveys to the fancy this inclination for ascent, and determines it to run against the natural stream of its thoughts and conceptions. This aspiring progress of the imagination suits the present disposition of the mind; and the difficulty, instead of extinguishing its vigour and alacrity, has the contrary effect, of sustaining and encreasing it. Virtue, genius, power, and riches are for this reason associated with height and sublimity; as poverty, slavery, and folly are conjoin'd with descent and lowness. Were the case the same with us as <i class="calibre10">Milton</i> represents it to be with the angels, to whom <i class="calibre10">descent is adverse</i>, and who <i class="calibre10">cannot sink without labour and compulsion</i>, this order of things wou'd be entirely inverted; as appears hence, that the very nature of ascent and descent is deriv'd from the difficulty and propensity, and consequently every one of their effects proceeds from that origin.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，想象力在从低处向高处运行时，会在其内部品质和原则中找到一个对立面，而且，当灵魂因喜悦和勇气而升华时，会以某种方式寻求对立面，并急切地投入到任何思想或行动的场景中，在那里它的勇气遇到了可以滋养和使用它的物质。由此可见，每一件振奋和激励灵魂的事情，无论是通过触动激情还是想象力，都会自然而然地将这种上升的倾向传达给想象力，并决定它与它的思想和概念的自然流向相反。想象力的这种向往的进步适合于目前的心态；而困难非但没有熄灭它的活力和敏捷性，反而有相反的效果，即维持和加强它。因此，美德、天才、权力和财富是与高度和崇高联系在一起的；正如贫穷、奴役和愚蠢是与卑微和低下联系在一起的。如果我们的情况与<i class="calibre10">弥尔顿</i>所描述的天使一样，对他们来说，<i class="calibre10">下降是不利的</i>，他们<i class="calibre10">没有劳动和强迫就不能下沉</i>，那么事情的顺序就会完全颠倒；由此可见，上升和下降的本质是由困难和倾向派生的，因此，它们的每一个效果都是由这个起源产生的。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">All this is easily apply'd to the present question, why a considerable distance in time produces a greater veneration for the distant objects than a like removal in space. The imagination moves with more difficulty in passing from one portion of time to another, than in a transition thro' the parts of space; and that because space or extension appears united to our senses, while time or succession is always broken and divided. This difficulty, when join'd with a small distance, interrupts and weakens the fancy: But has a contrary effect in a great removal. The mind, elevated by the vastness of its object, is still farther elevated by the difficulty of the conception; and being oblig'd every moment to renew its efforts in the transition from one part of time to another, feels a more vigorous and sublime disposition, than in a transition thro' the parts of space, where the ideas How along with easiness and facility. In this disposition, the imagination, passing, as is usual, from the consideration of the distance to the view of the distant objects, gives us a proportionable veneration for it; and this is the reason why all the relicts of antiquity are so precious in our eyes, and appear more valuable than what is brought even from the remotest parts of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">所有这些都很容易应用于目前的问题，即为什么在时间上的相当距离会比在空间上的同样距离产生对远方物体的更大敬意。想象力在从时间的一个部分转移到另一个部分时，比在空间的各个部分过渡时更加困难；这是因为空间或延伸在我们的感官看来是统一的，而时间或连续总是被打破和分割的。这种困难，当与小的距离结合在一起时，会打断和削弱想象力。但在巨大的距离中却有相反的效果。心灵因其对象的广袤而升华，又因构想的困难而进一步升华；而且由于每时每刻都必须重新努力从时间的一个部分过渡到另一个部分，因此感觉到一种更有活力和崇高的倾向，而不是在空间的各个部分的过渡中，在那里思想是轻松和便捷的。在这种状态下，想象力像往常一样，从对距离的考虑转向对远方物体的观察，使我们对它产生了相应的敬意；这就是为什么所有的古代遗物在我们眼中是如此珍贵，甚至比从世界最遥远的地方带来的东西更有价值。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The third phænomenon I have remark'd will be a full confirmation of this. 'Tis not every removal in time, which has the effect of producing veneration and esteem. We are not apt to imagine our posterity will excel us, or equal our ancestors. This phænomenon is the more remarkable, because any distance in futurity weakens not our ideas so much as an equal removal in the past. Tho' a removal in the past, when very great, encreases our passions beyond a like removal in the future, yet a small removal has a greater influence in diminishing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我所提到的第三个现象将充分证实这一点。并非每一次迁移都能产生崇敬和尊敬的效果。我们不容易想象我们的后代会超越我们，或与我们的祖先相等。这种现象更加显著，因为未来的任何距离都不会像过去的同等距离那样削弱我们的想法。尽管过去的距离如果非常大，会使我们的激情增加，超过未来的类似距离，但小的距离对减少激情的影响更大。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In our common way of thinking we are plac'd in a kind of middle station betwixt the past and future; and as our imagination finds a kind of difficulty in running along the former, and a facility in following the course of the latter, the difficulty conveys the notion of ascent, and the facility of the contrary. Hence we imagine our ancestors to be, in a manner, mounted above us, and our posterity to lie below us. Our fancy arrives not at the one without effort, but easily reaches the other: Which effort weakens the conception, where the distance is small; but enlarges and elevates the imagination, when attended with a suitable object. As on the other hand, the facility assists the fancy in a small removal, but takes off from its force when it contemplates any considerable distance.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们通常的思维方式中，我们处于一种介于过去和未来之间的中间位置；由于我们的想象力发现沿着前者运行是一种困难，而跟随后者的路线是一种便利，困难传达了上升的概念，而便利则相反。因此，我们想象我们的祖先在某种程度上是在我们之上，而我们的后代则在我们之下。我们的想象力不是不费吹灰之力就能达到这一点，而是很容易就能达到另一点。在距离较小的情况下，这种努力会削弱概念；但在有合适的对象时，则会扩大和提升想象力。另一方面，在距离较小的情况下，这种便利有助于想象力，但当它考虑到任何相当长的距离时，就会减弱它的力量。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be improper, before we leave this subject of the will, to resume, in a few words, all that has been said concerning it, in order to set the whole more distinctly before the eyes of the reader. What we commonly understand by <i class="calibre10">passion</i> is a violent and sensible emotion of mind, when any good or evil is presented, or any object, which, by the original formation of our faculties, is fitted to excite an appetite. By <i class="calibre10">reason</i> we mean affections of the very same kind with the former; but such as operate more calmly, and cause no disorder in the temper: Which tranquillity leads us into a mistake concerning them, and causes us to regard them as conclusions only of our intellectual faculties. Both the <i class="calibre10">causes</i> and <i class="calibre10">efforts</i> of these violent and calm passions are pretty variable, and depend, in a great measure, on the peculiar temper and disposition of every individual. Generally speaking, the violent passions have a more powerful influence on the will; tho' 'tis often found, that the calm ones, when corroborated by reflection, and seconded by resolution, are able to control them in their most furious movements. What makes this whole affair more uncertain, is, that a calm passion may easily be chang'd into a violent one, either by a change of temper, or of the circumstances and situation of the object, as by the borrowing of force from any attendant passion, by custom, or by exciting the imagination. Upon the whole, this struggle of passion and of reason, as it is call'd, diversifies human life, and makes men so different not only from each other, but also from themselves in different times. Philosophy can only account for a few of the greater and more sensible events of this war; but must leave all the smaller and more delicate revolutions, as dependent on principles too line and minute for her comprehension.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们离开这个意志的主题之前，用几句话来恢复所有关于它的说法，以便把整个情况更清楚地摆在读者的眼前，这也许是不恰当的。我们通常所理解的<i class="calibre10">激情</i>是指当任何善或恶出现时，或任何物体出现时，由我们的能力的原始形成，适合于激起食欲的一种剧烈的、可感觉到的心灵情绪。我们所说的<i class="calibre10">理性</i>是指与前者相同的情感；但这种情感的运作更加平静，不会引起脾气的紊乱。这种平静使我们对它们产生了误解，并使我们把它们看作是我们智力的结论。这些暴力和平静的激情的<i class="calibre10">原因</i>和<i class="calibre10">努力</i>都是相当多变的，而且在很大程度上取决于每个人的特殊脾气和性情。一般来说，狂暴的激情对意志有更大的影响；但人们经常发现，平静的激情在得到思考的证实和决心的支持后，能够控制它们最狂暴的运动。使整个事件更不确定的是，平静的激情可能很容易转变为暴力的激情，要么是脾气的变化，要么是对象的环境和状况的变化，比如从任何伴随的激情中借力，通过习俗，或者通过激发想象力。总的来说，这种被称为激情和理性的斗争使人类生活多样化，不仅使人与人之间有很大的不同，而且使人在不同的时代也有很大的不同。哲学只能解释这场战争中一些更重要和更有意义的事件；但必须离开所有较小和更微妙的革命，因为它们取决于她所理解的过于细微的原则。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis easy to observe, that the passions, both direct and indirect, are founded on pain and pleasure, and that in order to produce an affection of any kind, 'tis only requisite to present some good or evil. Upon the removal of pain and pleasure there immediately follows a removal of love and hatred, pride and humility, desire and aversion, and of most of our reflective or secondary impressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">很容易观察到，激情，无论是直接的还是间接的，都是建立在痛苦和快乐之上的，为了产生任何一种感情，只需要提出一些善或恶。痛苦和快乐被消除后，爱和恨、骄傲和谦卑、欲望和厌恶以及我们大多数的反射性或次要印象就会立即被消除。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The impressions, which arise from good and evil most naturally, and with the least preparation are the dared passions of desire and aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear, along with volition. The mind by an <i class="calibre10">original</i> instinct tends to unite itself with the good, and to avoid the evil, tho' they be conceiv'd merely in idea, and be consider'd as to exist in any future period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">最自然地产生于善和恶的印象，而且准备最少的是欲望和厌恶、悲伤和快乐、希望和恐惧等大胆的激情，以及意志力。心灵通过一种<i class="calibre10">原始的</i>本能倾向于将自己与善结合起来，并避免邪恶，尽管它们只是在概念上被设想，并被认为存在于任何未来的时间段。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But supposing that there is an immediate impression of pain or pleasure, and <i class="calibre10">that</i> arising from an object related to ourselves or others, this does not prevent the propensity or aversion, with the consequent emotions, but by concurring with certain dormant principles of the human mind, excites the new impressions of pride or humility, love or hatred. That propensity, which unites us to the object, or separates us from it, still continues to operate, but in conjunction with the <i class="calibre10">indirect</i> passions, which arise from a double relation of impressions and ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，假设有一个直接的痛苦或快乐的印象，而且<i class="calibre10">是</i>由一个与我们自己或他人有关的物体引起的，这并不能阻止倾向或厌恶，以及随之而来的情绪，而是通过与人类心灵的某些休眠原则相配合，激发出骄傲或谦卑、爱或恨的新印象。这种将我们与对象结合在一起或将我们与对象分开的倾向仍在继续发挥作用，但与<i class="calibre10">间接的</i>激情结合在一起，后者是由印象和观念的双重关系产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">These indirect passions, being always agreeable or uneasy, give in their turn additional force to the direct passions, and encrease our desire and aversion to the object. Thus a suit of fine cloaths produces pleasure from their beauty; and this pleasure produces the direct passions, or the impressions of volition and desire. Again, when these cloaths are consider'd as belonging to ourself, the double relation conveys to us the sentiment of pride, which is an indirect passion; and the pleasure, which attends that passion, returns back to the direct affections, and gives new force to our desire or volition, joy or hope.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这些间接的激情，总是令人愉快或不安，反过来给直接的激情以额外的力量，并增加我们对目标的欲望和厌恶。因此，一件漂亮的衣服会因其美丽而产生愉悦感；这种愉悦感会产生直接激情，或意志和欲望的印象。同样，当这些衣服被视为属于我们自己时，这种双重关系向我们传达了骄傲的情绪，这是一种间接的激情；而伴随着这种激情的快乐又回到了直接的情感中，并给我们的欲望或意志、快乐或希望带来了新的力量。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Beside good and evil, or in other words, pain and pleasure, the direct passions frequently arise from a natural impulse or instinct, which is perfectly unaccountable. Of this kind is the desire of punishment to our enemies, and of happiness to our friends; hunger, lust, and a few other bodily appetites. These passions, properly speaking, produce good and evil, and proceed not from them, like the other affections.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">除了善与恶，或者换句话说，痛苦与快乐，直接的激情经常来自一种自然的冲动或本能，这是完全无法解释的。这类欲望包括对敌人的惩罚和对朋友的幸福；饥饿、情欲和其他一些身体上的欲望。正确地说，这些激情产生了善和恶，并不像其他情感那样来自它们。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">None of the direct affections seem to merit our particular attention, except hope and fear, which we shall here endeavour to account for. 'Tis evident that the very same event, which by its certainty wou'd produce grief or joy, gives always rise to fear or hope, when only probable and uncertain. In order, therefore, to understand the reason why this circumstance makes such a considerable difference, we must reflect on what I have already advanc'd in the preceding book concerning the nature of probability.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">除了希望和恐惧之外，没有任何一种直接情感值得我们特别注意，我们将在此努力说明这一点。很明显，同样的事件，如果它是确定的，就会产生悲伤或快乐，但如果只是可能的和不确定的，就会引起恐惧或希望。因此，为了理解为什么这种情况会产生如此大的差异，我们必须思考我在上一本书中已经提出的关于概率的性质的内容。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Probability arises from an opposition of contrary chances or causes, by which the mind is not allow'd to fix on either side, but is incessantly tost from one to another, and at one moment is determin'd to consider an object as existent, and at another moment as the contrary. The imagination or understanding, call it which you please, fluctuates betwixt the opposite views; and tho' perhaps it may be oftner turn'd to the one side than the other, 'tis impossible for it, by reason of the opposition of causes or chances, to rest on either. The <i class="calibre10">pro</i> and <i class="calibre10">con</i> of the question alternately prevail; and the mind, surveying the object in its opposite principles, finds such a contrariety as utterly destroys all certainty and establish'd opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">概率产生于相反的机会或原因的对立，由于这种对立，思想不允许固定在任何一方，而是不断地从一个转向另一个，在某一时刻被确定为存在的对象，而在另一时刻则是相反的。想象力或理解力，随你怎么说，在两种相反的观点之间波动；尽管它可能更经常地转向一边而不是另一边，但由于原因或机会的对立，它不可能停留在任何一方。问题的<i class="calibre10">正方</i>和<i class="calibre10">反方</i>交替占上风；心灵在其相反的原则下审视对象时，发现这样的反差完全破坏了所有的确定性和既定的意见。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Suppose, then, that the object, conceding whose reality we are doubtful, is an object either of desire or aversion, 'tis evident, that, according as the mind turns itself either to the one side or the other, it must feel a momentary impression of joy or sorrow. An object, whose existence we desire, gives satisfaction, when we reflect on those causes, which produce it; and for the same reason excites grief or uneasiness from the opposite consideration: So that as the understanding, in all probable questions, is divided betwixt the contrary points of view, the affections must in the same manner be divided betwixt opposite emotions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那么，假设我们对其真实性表示怀疑的对象是一个欲望或厌恶的对象，那么很明显，根据心智的转向，它必须感受到短暂的快乐或悲伤的印象。当我们思考产生它的原因时，我们渴望的对象的存在会给我们带来满足感；而出于同样的原因，我们会因相反的考虑而感到悲伤或不安。因此，在所有可能的问题上，理解力被划分在相反的观点之间，情感也必须以同样的方式被划分在相反的情绪之间。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Now if we consider the human mind, we shall find, that with regard to the passions, 'tis not of the nature of a wind instrument of music, which in running over all the notes immediately loses the sound after the breath ceases; but rather resembles a string-instrument, where after each stroke the vibrations still retain some sound, which gradually and insensibly decays. The imagination is extreme quick and agile; but the passions are slow and restive: For which reason, when any object is presented, that affords a variety of views to the one, and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion, but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other. According as the probability inclines to good or evil, the passion of joy or sorrow predominates in the composition: Because the nature of probability is to cast a superior number of views or chances on one side; or, which is the same thing, a superior number of returns of one passion; or since the dispers'd passions are collected into one, a superior degree of that passion. That is, in other words, the grief and joy being intermingled with each other, by means of the contrary views of the imagination, produce by their union the passions of hope and fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，如果我们考虑人类的思想，我们会发现，就激情而言，它不像音乐的管乐器那样，在呼吸停止后，所有的音符都会立即失去声音；而是像一个弦乐器，在每次演奏后，振动仍然保留一些声音，这些声音逐渐地、不可见地衰减。想象力是极端迅速和敏捷的；但激情是缓慢和不安的。因此，当任何物体出现时，对一个人来说有各种不同的看法，对另一个人来说有各种不同的情绪；尽管想象力可能会非常迅速地改变它的看法；每一次划动都不会产生一个清晰明确的激情音符，但一种激情总是与另一种激情混在一起，混淆不清。根据概率倾向于善或恶，快乐或悲伤的激情在作品中占主导地位。因为概率的本质是把更多的观点或机会投向一方；或者说，这是同一件事，是一种激情的更多回报；或者说，由于分散的激情汇集成一种，这种激情的程度更高。也就是说，换句话说，悲伤和快乐相互交织，通过想象力的相反观点，通过它们的结合产生希望和恐惧的激情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Upon this head there may be started a very curious question conceding that contrariety of passions, which is our present subject. 'Tis observable, that where the objects of contrary passions are presented at once, beside the encrease of the predominant passion (which has been already explain'd, and commonly arises at their first shock or rencounter) it sometimes happens, that both the passions exist successively, and by short intervals; sometimes, that they destroy each other, and neither of them takes place; and sometimes that both of them remain united in the mind. It may, therefore, be ask'd, by what theory we can explain these variations, and to what general principle we can reduce them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这个问题上，可以开始讨论一个非常奇怪的问题，即承认激情的反差，这就是我们现在的主题。可以看到，当相反的激情对象同时出现时，除了占主导地位的激情增加外（这一点已经解释过了，通常是在它们第一次冲击或相遇时产生的），有时会发生，两种激情相继存在，而且间隔时间很短；有时，它们互相破坏，没有一个发生；有时，它们两个在头脑中保持统一。因此，人们可能会问，我们可以用什么理论来解释这些变化，我们可以用什么一般原则来减少它们。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">When the contrary passions arise from objects entirely different, they take place alternately, the want of relation in the ideas separating the impressions from each other, and preventing their opposition. Thus when a man is afflicted for the loss of a law-suit, and joyful for the birth of a son, the mind running from the agreeable to the calamitous object, with whatever celerity it may perform this motion, can scarcely temper the one affection with the other, and remain betwixt them in a state of indifference.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">当相反的激情由完全不同的对象产生时，它们就会交替发生，思想中的关系的缺乏将印象彼此分开，并阻止它们的对立。因此，当一个人因诉讼失败而感到痛苦，又因儿子的出生而感到高兴时，无论他的思想如何迅速地从愉快的对象跑到灾难性的对象，都几乎无法用另一种感情来调节这一种感情，而在它们之间保持一种冷漠的状态。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It more easily attains that calm situation, when the same event is of a mixt nature, and contains something adverse and something prosperous in its different circumstances. For in that case, both the passions, mingling with each other by means of the relation, become mutually destructive, and leave the mind in perfect tranquility.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">当同一事件具有混合性质，并且在其不同的情况下包含一些不利和有利的东西时，它更容易达到这种平静的状况。因为在这种情况下，两种激情通过这种关系相互交融，变得相互破坏，并使心灵处于完美的平静之中。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But suppose, in the third place, that the object is not a compound of good or evil, but is consider'd as probable or improbable in any degree; in that case I assert, that the contrary passions will both of them be present at once in the soul, and instead of destroying and tempering each other, will subsist together, and produce a third impression or affection by their union. Contrary passions are not capable of destroying each other, except when their contrary movements exactly encounter, and are opposite in their direction, as well as in the sensation they produce. This exact encounter depends upon the relations of those ideas, from which they are deriv'd, and is more or less perfect, according to the degrees of the relation. In the case of probability the contrary chances are so far related, that they determine concerning the existence or nonexistence of the same object. But this relation is far from being perfect; since some of the chances lie on the side of existence, and others on that of non-existence; which are objects altogether incompatible. Tis impossible by one steady view to survey the opposite chances, and the events dependent on them; but 'tis necessary, that the imagination shou'd run alternately from the one to the other. Each view of the imagination produces its peculiar passion, which decays away by degrees, and is follow'd by a sensible vibration after the stroke. The incompatibility of the views keeps the passions from shocking in a direct line, if that expression may be a1low'd; and yet their relation is sufficient to mingle their fainter emotions. 'Tis after this manner that hope and fear arise from the different mixture of these opposite passions of grief and joy, and from their imperfect union and conjunction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，第三点，假设对象不是善或恶的复合体，而是在任何程度上被认为是可能的或不可能的；在这种情况下，我断言，相反的激情将同时存在于灵魂中，而不是破坏和节制对方，将一起存在，并通过它们的结合产生第三个印象或感情。相互对立的激情不可能相互破坏，除非它们相反的运动正好相遇，而且在方向上和它们产生的感觉上都是相反的。这种确切的相遇取决于这些观念的关系，它们是由这些观念派生出来的，并且根据关系的程度，或多或少是完美的。在概率的情况下，相反的机会是如此的相关，以至于它们决定了同一个物体的存在或不存在。但这种关系远非完美；因为有些机会位于存在的一边，而另一些则位于不存在的一边；这些对象是完全不相容的。通过一个稳定的视角来观察相反的机会和依赖于它们的事件是不可能的；但想象力从一个到另一个交替运行是必要的。想象力的每一种观点都会产生其特有的激情，这种激情会逐渐消退，并在中风之后产生明显的震动。这些观点的不相容性使激情不能直接冲击，如果这种表达方式可以降低的话；但它们之间的关系足以使它们更微弱的情感混合在一起。正是按照这种方式，希望和恐惧产生于悲伤和欢乐这些相反的激情的不同混合，以及它们的不完全结合和结合。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Upon the whole, contrary passions succeed each other alternately, when they arise from different objects: They mutually destroy each other, when they proceed from different parts of the same: And they subsist both of them, and mingle together, when they are deriv'd from the contrary and incompatible chances or possibilities, on which any one object depends. The influence of the relations of ideas is plainly seen in this whole affair. If the objects of the contrary passions be totally different, the passions are like two opposite liquors in different bottles, which have no influence on each other. If the objects be intimately connected, the passions are like an <i class="calibre10">alcali</i> and an <i class="calibre10">acid</i>, which, being mingled, destroy each other. If the relation be more imperfect, and consists in the contradictory views of the same object, the passions are like oil and vinegar, which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and incorporate.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">总的来说，当相反的激情从不同的对象中产生时，它们就会交替地继承。当它们从同一物体的不同部分产生时，它们相互破坏：而当它们从任何一个物体所依赖的相反和不相容的机会或可能性中产生时，它们同时存在，并混合在一起。在这整个事件中，思想关系的影响是显而易见的。如果相反的激情的对象是完全不同的，那么这些激情就像装在不同瓶子里的两种相反的酒，对彼此没有影响。如果对象是密切相关的，那么激情就像<i class="calibre10">碱</i>和<i class="calibre10">酸</i>，它们混合在一起就会相互破坏。如果这种关系更不完美，包括对同一对象的矛盾看法，那么激情就像油和醋，无论如何混合，都不会完美地结合和融合。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The passions of fear and hope may arise when the chances are equal on both sides, and no superiority can be discover'd in the one above the other. Nay, in this situation the passions are rather the strongest, as the mind has then the least foundation to rest upon, and is toss'd with the greatest uncertainty. Throw in a superior degree of probability to the side of grief you immediately see that passion diffuse itself over the composition, and tincture it into fear. Encrease the probability, and by that means the grief, the fear prevails still more and more, till at last it runs insensibly, as the joy continually diminishes, into pure grief, after you have brought it to this situation, diminish the grief, after the same manner that you encreas'd it; by diminishing the probability on that side, and you'll see the passion clear every moment, 'till it changes insensibly into hope; which again runs, after the same manner, by slow degrees, into joy, as you encrease that part of the composition by the encrease of the probability. Are not these as plain proofs, that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief and joy, as in optics 'tis a proof, that a colour'd ray of the sun passing thro' a prism, is a composition of two others, when, as you diminish or encrease the quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably more or less in the composition?

		<p class="block_6 cn">当双方的机会均等时，恐惧和希望的激情可能会出现，而且无法发现一个人比另一个人有优势。不，在这种情况下，这种激情反而是最强烈的，因为这时人们的心态是最没有基础可言的，而且被最大的不确定性所折腾。如果在悲痛的一方加入更多的可能性，你会立即看到激情在成分中弥漫开来，并将其染成恐惧。增加概率，并通过这种方式增加悲伤，恐惧就会越来越多，直到最后，随着快乐的不断减少，它就会不由自主地变成纯粹的悲伤，在你把它带到这种情况之后，按照你增加它的方式减少悲伤。你会看到激情每时每刻都很清晰，'直到它不经意地变成希望；希望又以同样的方式，通过缓慢的程度，变成快乐，因为你通过增加概率来增加那部分成分。这些不正是恐惧和希望的激情是悲伤和快乐的混合体的明证吗，就像在光学中，当你减少或增加其中一种的数量时，你会发现它在成分中按比例的增加或减少，这就是证明，一条彩色的太阳光穿过棱镜，是由另外两种组成的。我相信，无论是自然哲学还是道德哲学，都没有更有力的证明。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，不仅是在善恶不确定的地方，就其<i class="calibre10">存在</i>而言，而且就其<i class="calibre10">种类</i>而言，恐惧或希望也会产生。如果有人告诉他，他的一个儿子突然被杀了，他不会怀疑这个人的真实性，显然，在他得到确切的信息之前，这个事件所引起的激情不会变成纯粹的悲痛。这里有一个确定的邪恶，但它的种类是不确定的。因此，我们在这种情况下感受到的恐惧没有丝毫喜悦的成分，只是源于幻想在其对象之间的波动。尽管问题的每一方在这里都产生了同样的激情，但这种激情不能稳定下来，而是从想象中得到一种颤抖和不稳定的运动，在其原因和感觉上类似于悲伤和欢乐的混合和争论。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">From these principles we may account for a phænomenon in the passions, which at first sight seems very extraordinary, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that surprize is apt to change into fear, and every thing that is unexpected affrights us. The most obvious conclusion from this is, that human nature is in general pusilanimous; since upon the sudden appearance of any object we immediately conclude it to be an evil, and without waiting till we can examine its nature, whether it be good or bad, are at first affected with fear. This I say is the most obvious conclusion; but upon farther examination we shall find that the phænomenon is otherwise to be accounted for. The suddenness and strangeness of an appearance naturally excite a commotion in the mind, like every thing for which we are not prepar'd, and to which we are not accustom'd. This commotion, again, naturally produces a curiosity or inquisitiveness, which being very violent, from the strong and sudden impulse of the object, becomes uneasy, and resembles in its fluctuation and uncertainty, the sensation of fear or the mix'd passions of grief and joy. This image of fear naturally converts into the thing itself, and gives us a real apprehension of evil, as the mind always forms its judgments more from its present disposition than from the nature of its objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">根据这些原则，我们可以解释激情中的一种现象，这种现象乍一看似乎很不寻常，<i class="calibre10">即</i>惊讶很容易变成恐惧，每一件出乎意料的事情都会让我们感到不安。由此得出的最明显的结论是，人类的本性一般都是胆小怕事的；因为任何物体的突然出现，我们都会立即断定它是邪恶的，而且不等我们审视它的性质，不管它是好是坏，一开始就会受到恐惧的影响。我说这是最明显的结论；但经过进一步的研究，我们会发现，这种现象的原因是其他的。一个外表的突然性和陌生性自然会在头脑中激起一阵骚动，就像我们没有准备好的、不习惯的每一件事。这种骚动又自然产生了一种好奇心或探究性，这种好奇心或探究性由于对象的强烈和突然的冲动而变得非常剧烈，并在其波动和不确定性中类似于恐惧的感觉或悲伤和快乐的混合激情。这种恐惧的形象自然而然地转化为事物本身，并给我们一种对邪恶的真正理解，因为心灵总是更多地从其目前的处置而不是从其对象的性质形成其判断。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus all kinds of uncertainty have a strong connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cause any opposition of passions by the opposite views and considerations they present to us. A person, who has left his friend in any malady, will feel more anxiety upon his account, than if he were present, tho' perhaps he is not only incapable of giving him assistance, but likewise of judging of the event of his sickness. In this case, tho' the principal object of the passion, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> the life or death of his friend, be to him equally uncertain when present as when absent; yet there are a thousand little circumstances of his friend's situation and condition, the knowledge of which fixes the idea, and prevents that fluctuation and uncertainty so near ally'd to fear. Uncertainty is, indeed, in one respect as near ally'd to hope as to fear, since it makes an essential part in the composition of the former passion; but the reason, why it inclines not to that side, is, that uncertainty alone is uneasy, and has a relation of impressions to the uneasy passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，所有种类的不确定性都与恐惧有着密切的联系，尽管它们并没有因为它们向我们展示的相反的观点和考虑而引起任何激情的对抗。一个人，如果他的朋友身患疾病，他就会因为他的原因而感到更加焦虑，尽管他可能不仅无法给他提供帮助，而且也无法判断他的病情。在这种情况下，尽管激情的主要目标，<i class="calibre10">即</i>他的朋友的生死，对他来说，在场时和不在场时同样不确定；但他的朋友的处境和状况有无数的小情况，对这些情况的了解可以固定这种想法，并防止那种与恐惧密切相关的波动和不确定性。的确，在某一方面，不确定性与希望和恐惧一样接近，因为它是构成前一种激情的重要部分；但是，为什么它不倾向于那一方，原因是只有不确定性才是不安的，并且与不安的激情有印象的关系。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But this principle of the connexion of fear with uncertainty I carry farther, and observe that any doubt produces that passion, even tho' it presents nothing to us on any side but what is good and desire able. A virgin, on her bridal night goes to bed full of fears and apprehensions, tho' she expects nothing but pleasure of the highest kind, and what she has long wish`d for. The newness and greatness of the event, the confusion of wishes and joys, so embarrass the mind, that it knows not on what passion to fix itself; from whence arises a fluttering or unsettledness of the spirits, which being, in some degree, uneasy, very naturally degenerates into fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但这个恐惧与不确定的关系的原则，我更进一步指出，任何怀疑都会产生这种激情，即使它在任何方面都没有给我们带来任何好处和愿望。一个处女在新婚之夜充满恐惧和忧虑地上床睡觉，尽管她所期待的只是最高级的快乐和她长久以来所希望的东西。事件的新奇和重大，愿望和欢乐的混乱，使人的思想如此窘迫，以至于它不知道该把自己固定在什么激情上；由此产生了精神上的浮动或不稳定，这在某种程度上是不安的，非常自然地退化为恐惧。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Truth is of two kinds, consisting either in the discovery of the proportions of ideas, consider'd as such, or in the conformity of our ideas of objects to their real existence. 'Tis certain, that the former species of truth, is not desir'd merely as truth, and that 'tis not the justness of our conclusions, which alone gives the pleasure. For these conclusions are equally just, when we discover the equality of two bodies by a pair of compasses, as when we learn it by a mathematical demonstration; and tho' in the one case the proofs be demonstrative, and in the other only sensible, yet generally speaking, the mind acquiesces with equal assurance in the one as in the other. And in an arithmetical operation, where both the truth and the assurance are of the same nature, as in the most profound algebraical problem, the pleasure is very inconsiderable, if rather it does not degenerate into pain: Which is an evident proof, that the satisfaction, which we sometimes receive from the discovery of truth, proceeds not from it, merely as such, but only as endow'd with certain qualities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">真理有两种，一种是发现观念的比例，认为是这样，另一种是我们对物体的观念与它们的真实存在相一致。可以肯定的是，前一种真理并不仅仅是作为真理而需要的，而且我们的结论的公正性并不是唯一给人带来快乐的。因为当我们通过一对罗盘发现两个物体的平等性时，和通过数学演示了解它时，这些结论同样是公正的；尽管在一种情况下，证明是示范性的，而在另一种情况下，只是感性的，但一般说来，心灵对这一种和另一种的默认是同样肯定的。而在一个算术运算中，真理和保证都具有相同的性质，就像在最深奥的代数问题中一样，快乐是非常微不足道的，如果说它没有退化成痛苦的话。这是一个明显的证据，说明我们有时从发现真理中得到的满足感，并不是从它本身得到的，而只是因为它被赋予了某些品质。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The first and most considerable circumstance requisite to render truth agreeable, is the genius and capacity, which is employ'd in its invention and discovery. What is easy and obvious is never valu'd; and even what is <i class="calibre10">in itself</i> difficult, if we come to the knowledge of it without difficulty, and without any stretch of thought or judgment, is but little regarded. We love to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians; but shou'd receive small entertainment from a person, who shou'd barely inform us of the proportions of lines and angles, tho' we repos'd the utmost confidence both in his judgment and veracity. In this case 'tis sufficient to have ears to learn the truth. We never are oblig'd to fix our attention or exert our genius; which of all other exercises of the mind is the most pleasant and agreeable.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">使真理令人满意的第一个也是最重要的情况，是用于发明和发现真理的天才和能力。容易和明显的东西从不被重视；甚至<i class="calibre10">本身</i>就很难的东西，如果我们不费吹灰之力就能了解它，不需要任何思考或判断，也不会被重视。我们喜欢追踪数学家的演示；但如果一个人勉强告诉我们线条和角度的比例，尽管我们对他的判断力和真实性都抱有极大的信心，但我们从他那里得到的娱乐却很少。在这种情况下，只要有耳朵就能了解真相。我们从来没有必要固定我们的注意力或发挥我们的天才；在所有其他的思维练习中，这是最令人愉快和高兴的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' the exercise of genius be the principal source of that satisfaction we receive from the sciences, yet I doubt, if it be alone sufficient to give us any considerable enjoyment. The truth we discover must also be of some importance. 'Tis easy to multiply algebraical problems to infinity, nor is there any end in the discovery of the proportions of conic sections; tho' few mathematicians take any pleasure in these researches, but turn their thoughts to what is more useful and important. Now the question is, after what manner this utility and importance operate upon us? The difficulty on this head arises from hence, that many philosophers have consum'd their time, have destroy'd their health, and neglected their fortune, in the search of such truths, as they esteem'd important and useful to the world, tho' it appear'd from their whole conduct and behaviour, that they were not endow'd with any share of public spirit, nor had any concern for the interests of mankind. Were they convinc'd, that their discoveries were of no consequence, they wou'd entirely lose all relish for their studies, and that tho' the consequences be entirely indifferent to them; which seems to be a contradiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管天才的发挥是我们从科学中得到的满足感的主要来源，但我怀疑，仅仅是它是否足以给我们带来任何相当大的享受。我们发现的真理也必须具有一定的重要性。将代数问题乘以无穷大是很容易的，发现圆锥曲线的比例也没有任何意义；尽管很少有数学家对这些研究感到高兴，而是将他们的思想转向更有用和更重要的东西。现在的问题是，这种实用性和重要性是以何种方式作用于我们的？这方面的困难来自于，许多哲学家为了寻找他们认为重要的、对世界有用的真理，耗费了他们的时间，毁掉了他们的健康，忽略了他们的财富，尽管从他们的整个行为和表现来看，他们没有任何公共精神，也没有对人类的利益有任何关注。如果他们相信他们的发现没有任何意义，他们就会完全失去对研究的兴趣，尽管后果对他们来说是完全无所谓的；这似乎是一个矛盾。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To remove this contradiction, we must consider, that there are certain desires and inclinations, which go no farther than the imagination, and are rather the faint shadows and images of passions, than any real affections. Thus, suppose a man, who takes a survey of the fortifications of any city; considers their strength and advantages, natural or acquir'd; observes the disposition and contrivance of the bastions, ramparts, mines, and other military works; 'tis plain, that in proportion as all these are fitted to attain their ends, he will receive a suitable pleasure and satisfaction. This pleasure, as it arises from the utility, not the form of the objects, can be no other than a sympathy with the inhabitants, for whose security all this art is employ'd; tho' 'tis possible, that this person, as a stranger or an enemy, may in his heart have no kindness for them, or may even entertain a hatred against them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了消除这种矛盾，我们必须考虑到，有一些欲望和倾向，除了想象之外，并没有走得更远，而是激情的微弱影子和图像，而不是任何真正的情感。因此，假设一个人对任何城市的防御工事进行调查；考虑它们的力量和优势，无论是天然的还是获得的；观察堡垒、城墙、地雷和其他军事工程的布局和安排；很明显，如果所有这些都适合达到它们的目的，他将得到适当的快乐和满足。这种快乐，因为它来自于物体的效用，而不是形式，除了对居民的同情之外，没有别的了，因为所有这些艺术都是为了他们的安全而使用的；尽管这个人作为一个陌生人或敌人，有可能在心里对他们没有好感，甚至可能对他们怀有仇恨。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It may indeed be objected, that such a remote sympathy is a very slight foundation for a passion, and that so much industry and application, as we frequently observe in philosophers, can never be deriv'd from so inconsiderable an original. But here I return to what I have already remark'd, that the pleasure of study consists chiefly in the action of the mind. and the exercise of the genius and understanding in discovery or comprehension of any truth. If the importance of the truth be requisite to compleat the pleasure, 'tis not on account of any considerable addition, which of itself it brings to our enjoyment, but only because 'tis, in some measure, requisite to fix our attention. When we are careless and inattentive, the same action of the understanding has no effect upon us, nor is able to convey any of that satisfaction, which arises from it, when we are in another disposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">的确，有人反对说，这种遥远的同情对于一种激情来说是非常微不足道的基础，而且我们经常在哲学家身上看到的那么多的努力和应用，是不可能从如此微不足道的原点中得到的。但在这里，我又回到了我已经说过的，学习的乐趣主要在于思想的行动，以及在发现或理解任何真理时对天才和理解力的锻炼。如果真理的重要性是完成快乐的必要条件，那也不是因为它本身给我们的享受带来了任何可观的补充，而只是因为在某种程度上，它是固定我们注意力的必要条件。当我们漫不经心，注意力不集中时，理解力的同一行动对我们没有影响，也不能传达任何满足感，而当我们处于另一种状态时，这种满足感就会产生。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But beside the action of the mind, which is the principal foundation of the pleasure, there is likewise requir'd a degree of success in the attainment of the end, or the discovery of that truth we examine. Upon this head I shall make a general remark, which may be useful on many occasions, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that where the mind pursues any end with passion; tho' that passion be not deriv'd originally from the end, but merely from the action and pursuit; yet by the natural course of the affections, we acquire a concern for the end itself, and are uneasy under any disappointment we meet with in the pursuit of it. This proceeds from the relation and parallel direction of the passions above-mention'd.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，除了作为快乐的主要基础的思想行动之外，在达到目的或发现我们所研究的真理方面也需要一定程度的成功。在这个问题上，我要做一个一般性的评论，这在很多场合都是有用的，那<i class="calibre10">就是</i>当人们带着激情去追求任何目的时，尽管这种激情不是最初来自于目的，而只是来自于行动和追求；但通过情感的自然过程，我们获得了对目的本身的关注，并且在追求它的过程中遇到任何失望都会感到不安。这是由上述激情的关系和平行方向产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To illustrate all this by a similar instance, I shall observe, that there cannot be two passions more nearly resembling each other, than those of hunting and philosophy, whatever disproportion may at first sight appear betwixt them. 'Tis evident, that the pleasure of hunting consists in the action of the mind and body; the motion, the attention, the difficulty, and the uncertainty. 'Tis evident likewise, that these actions must be attended with an idea of utility, in order to their having any effect upon us. A man of the greatest fortune, and the farthest remov'd from avarice, tho' he takes a pleasure in hunting after partridges and pheasants, feels no satisfaction in shooting crows and magpies; and that because he considers the first as fit for the table, and the other as entirely useless. Here 'tis certain, that the utility or importance of itself causes no real passion, but is only requisite to support the imagination; and the same person, who over-looks a ten times greater profit in any other subject, is pleas'd to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers, after having employ'd several hours in hunting after them. To make the parallel betwixt hunting and philosophy more compleat, we may observe, that tho' in both cases the end of our action may in itself be despis'd, yet in the heat of the action we acquire such an attention to this end, that we are very uneasy under any disappointments, and are sorry when we either miss our game, or fall into any error in our reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了用一个类似的例子来说明这一切，我想说的是，不可能有两种激情比打猎和哲学更接近，无论它们之间乍看之下有什么不相称之处。很明显，打猎的乐趣在于身心的活动；运动、注意力、困难和不确定性。同样明显的是，这些行动必须伴随着实用的想法，才能对我们产生任何影响。一个最富有的人，一个最不贪婪的人，尽管他以狩猎鹧鸪和野鸡为乐，但对射杀乌鸦和喜鹊并不感到满意；这是因为他认为前者适合上桌，而后者则完全无用。这里可以肯定的是，实用性或重要性本身并没有引起真正的激情，而只是支持想象力的必要条件；同样一个人，如果忽视了其他方面十倍以上的利益，在用了几个小时的时间打猎后，带回家半打木鸡或鸻鸟，就会感到很高兴。为了使打猎和哲学之间的平行关系更加完整，我们可以注意到，虽然在这两种情况下，我们行动的目的本身可能被轻视，但在行动的热潮中，我们获得了对这个目的的关注，以至于我们对任何失望都感到非常不安，当我们错过我们的游戏，或在我们的推理中陷入任何错误时，都会感到遗憾。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If we want another parallel to these affections, we may consider the passion of gaming, which affords a pleasure from the same principles as hunting and philosophy. It has been remark'd, that the pleasure of gaming arises not from interest alone; since many leave a sure gain for this entertainment: Neither is it deriv'd from the game alone; since the same persons have no satisfaction, when they play for nothing: But proceeds from both these causes united, tho' separately they have no effect. 'Tis here, as in certain chymical preparations, where the mixture of two clear and transparent liquids produces a third, which is opaque and colour'd.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果我们想与这些情感作另一种比较，我们可以考虑博彩的热情，它所带来的快乐与狩猎和哲学的原理相同。有人说，博彩的乐趣不单单来自于兴趣；因为许多人为了这种娱乐而离开了可靠的收益。它也不是单单从游戏中产生的；因为同样的人在白玩的时候没有满足感：而是从这两个原因联合起来产生的，尽管它们单独没有效果。在这里，就像在某些糜烂的制剂中，两种清澈透明的液体混合在一起，产生了第三种不透明的颜色。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The interest, which we have in any game, engages our attention, without which we can have no enjoyment, either in that or in any other action. Our attention being once engag'd, the difficulty, variety, and sudden reverses of fortune, still farther interest us; and 'tis from that concern our satisfaction arises. Human life is so tiresome a scene, and men generally are of such indolent dispositions, that whatever amuses them, tho' by a passion mixt with pain, does in the main give them sensible pleasure. And this pleasure is here encreas'd by the nature of the objects, which being sensible, and of a narrow compass, are enter'd into with facility, and are agreeable to the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们对任何游戏的兴趣都会吸引我们的注意力，没有这种兴趣，我们就不能享受到任何乐趣，无论是在那方面还是在任何其他行动方面。我们的注意力一旦被吸引住了，困难、变化和命运的突然逆转就会进一步引起我们的兴趣；而我们的满足感正是来自于这种关注。人类的生活是如此令人厌烦，而人一般都有这种懒惰的性格，因此，凡是能使他们感到快乐的事情，尽管是与痛苦混在一起的激情，但主要是给他们带来明显的快乐。这种快乐在这里是由于对象的性质而增加的，这些对象是感性的，而且范围很窄，可以很容易地进入，并为想象力所喜爱。</p></div>

Some people have an insatiable desire of knowing the actions and circumstances of their neighbours, tho' their interest be no way concern'd in them, and they must entirely depend on others for their information; in which case there is no room for study or application.

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been prov'd at large, that the influence of belief is at once to inliven and infix any idea in the imagination, and prevent all kind of hesitation and uncertainty about it. Both these circumstances are advantageous. By the vivacity of the idea we interest the fancy, and produce, tho' in a lesser degree, the same pleasure, which arises from a moderate passion. As the vivacity of the idea gives pleasure, so its certainty prevents uneasiness, by fixing one particular idea in the mind, and keeping it from wavering in the choice of its objects. 'Tis a quality of human nature, which is conspicuous on many occasions, and is common both to the mind and body, that too sudden and violent a change is unpleasant to us, and that however any objects may in themselves be indifferent, yet their alteration gives uneasiness. As 'tis the nature of doubt to cause a variation in the thought, and transport us suddenly from one idea to another, it must of consequence be the occasion of pain. This pain chiefly takes place, where interest, relation, or the greatness and novelty of any event interests us in it. 'Tis not every matter of fact, of which we have a curiosity to be inform'd; neither are they such only as we have an interest to know. 'Tis sudicient if the idea strikes on us with such force, and concerns us so nearly, as to give us an uneasiness in its instability and inconstancy. A stranger, when he arrives first at any town, may be entirely indifferent about knowing the history and adventures of the inhabitants; but as he becomes farther acquainted with them, and has liv'd any considerable time among them, he acquires the same curiosity as the natives. When we are reading the history of a nation, we may have an ardent desire of clearing up any doubt or difficulty, that occurs in it; but become careless in such researches, when the ideas of these events are, in a great measure, obliterated.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning, that it may silence, without convincing an antagonist, and requires the same intense study to make us sensible of its force, that was at first requisite for its invention. When we leave our closet, and engage in the common affairs of life, its conclusions seem to vanish, like the phantoms of the night on the appearance of the morning; and 'tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we had attain'd with difficulty. This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of reasoning, where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first propositions, and where we often lose sight of all the most receiv'd maxims, either of philosophy or common life. I am not, however, without hopes, that the present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances; and that our reasonings concerning <i class="calibre10">morals</i> will corroborate whatever has been said concerning the <i class="calibre10">understanding</i> and the <i class="calibre10">passions</i>. Morality is a subject that interests us above all others: We fancy the peace of society to be at stake in every decision concerning it; and 'tis evident, that this concern must make our speculations appear more real and solid, than where the subject is, in a great measure, indifferent to ns. What affects us, we conclude can never be a chimera; and as our passion is engag'd on the one side or the other, we naturally think that the question lies within human comprehension; which, in other cases of this nature, we are apt to entertain some doubt of. Without this advantage I never should have ventur'd upon a third volume of such abstruse philosophy, in an age, wherein the greatest part of men seem agreed to convert reading into an amusement, and to reject every thing that requires any considerable degree of attention to be comprehended.</p>

In order, therefore, to judge of these systems, we need only consider, whether it be possible, from reason alone, to distinguish betwixt moral good and evil, or whether there must concur some other principles to enable us to make that distinction.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">If morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions, 'twere in vain to take such pains to inculcate it; and nothing wou'd be more fruitless than that multitude of rules and precepts, with which all moralists abound. Philosophy is commonly divided into <i class="calibre10">speculative</i> and <i class="calibre10">practical</i>; and as morality is always comprehended under the latter division, 'tis supposed to influence our passions and actions, and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the understanding. And this is confirm'd by common experience, which informs us, that men are often govern'd by their duties, and are deter'd from some actions by the opinion of injustice, and impell'd to others by that of obligation.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果道德对人类的激情和行为自然没有影响，那么花这么大的力气来灌输它也是徒劳的；没有什么比所有道德家都充斥着大量的规则和戒律更没有结果了。哲学通常分为<i class="calibre10">推测性的</i>和<i class="calibre10">实践性的</i>；由于道德总是包含在后者之下，所以它被认为会影响我们的激情和行动，并超越理解力的冷静和懒惰的判断。这一点被常见的经验所证实，它告诉我们，人常常被他们的责任所支配，并因不公正的观点而阻止某些行为，又因义务的观点而促使其他行为。</p></div>

An active principle can never be founded on an inactive; and if reason be inactive in itself, it must remain so in all its shapes and appearances, whether it exerts itself in natural or moral subjects, whether it considers the powers of external bodies, or the actions of rational beings.</p>

Whatever, therefore, is not susceptible of this agreement or disagreement, is incapable of being true or false, and can never be an object of our reason. Now 'tis evident our passions, volitions, and actions, are not susceptible of any such agreement or disagreement; being original facts and realities, compleat in themselves, and implying no reference to other passions, volitions, and actions.

Actions may be laudable or blameable; but they cannot be reasonable or unreasonable: Laudable or blameable, therefore, are not the same with reasonable or unreasonable. The merit and demerit of actions frequently contradict, and sometimes controul our natural propensities. But reason has no such influence. Moral distinctions, therefore, are not the offspring of reason. Reason is wholly inactive, and can never be the source of so active a principle as conscience, or a sense of morals.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But perhaps it may be said, that tho' no will or action can be immediately contradictory to reason, yet we may find such a contradiction in some of the attendants of the action, that is, in its causes or effects.

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但也许可以说，虽然没有任何意志或行动可以立即与理性相矛盾，但我们可以在行动的某些伴随物中，即在其原因或结果中发现这种矛盾。行动可能会引起判断，或者是由判断<i class="calibre10">间接</i>引起的，当判断与激情同时存在时；通过一种滥用的说话方式，哲学不允许这样做，同样的矛盾可能会因此而被归于行动。这个真理或谬误在多大程度上可以成为道德的源泉，现在要考虑的是。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It has been observ'd, that reason, in a strict and philosophical sense, can have an influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it excites a passion by informing us of the existence of something which is a proper object of it; or when it discovers the connexion of causes and effects, so as to afford us means of exerting any passion. These are the only kinds of judgment, which can accompany our actions, or can be said to produce them in any manner; and it must be allow'd, that these judgments may often be false and erroneous. A person may be affected with passion, by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an object, which has no tendency to produce either of these sensations, or which produces the contrary to what is imagin'd. A person may also take false measures for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct, instead of forwarding the execution of any project. These false judgments may be thought to affect the passions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be said to render them unreasonable, in a figurative and improper way of speaking. But tho' this be acknowledge'd, 'tis easy to observe, that these errors are so far from being the source of all immorality, that they are commonly very innocent, and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fall into them. They extend not beyond a mistake of <i class="calibre10">fact</i>, which moralists have not generally suppos'd criminal, as being perfectly involuntary. I am more to be lamented than blam'd, if I am mistaken with regard to the influence of objects in producing pain or pleasure, or if I know not the proper means of satisfying my desires. No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral character. A fruit, for instance, that is really disagreeable, appears to me at a distance, and thro' mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious. Here is one error. I choose certain means of reaching this fruit, which are not proper for my end. Here is a second error; nor is there any third one, which can ever possibly enter into our reasonings concerning actions. I ask, therefore, if a man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been? Or if it be possible to imagine, that such errors are the sources of all immorality?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">据观察，在严格的哲学意义上，理性对我们行为的影响只有两种方式。一是当它通过告诉我们存在着某种适当的激情对象而激发激情；二是当它发现了原因和结果的联系，从而为我们提供了施加任何激情的手段。这些是唯一的几种判断，它们可以伴随着我们的行为，或者可以说以任何方式产生这些行为；必须允许这些判断经常是错误的，是错误的。一个人可能会受到激情的影响，因为他认为痛苦或快乐存在于一个物体中，而这个物体并没有产生这两种感觉的趋势，或者产生了与想象中相反的感觉。一个人也可能采取错误的措施来达到他的目的，并可能通过他愚蠢的行为来延缓而不是推进任何项目的实施。这些错误的判断可能被认为会影响到与之相关的激情和行动，并可能被说成是使它们变得不合理，这是一种比喻性的、不恰当的说话方式。但是，尽管承认这一点，我们不难发现，这些错误远不是所有不道德的根源，它们通常是非常无辜的，并没有给不幸陷入其中的人带来任何形式的罪过。它们的范围不超过<i class="calibre10">事实</i>的错误，道德家一般不认为这是犯罪，因为它完全是非自愿的。如果我对产生痛苦或快乐的物体的影响有误，或者我不知道满足我的欲望的适当方法，我更应该感到遗憾而不是责备。没有人可以把这种错误看作是我道德品质的缺陷。例如，一个真正令人厌恶的水果，在远处看来，我误以为它是令人愉快和美味的。这就是一个错误。我选择了某些手段来达到这个果实，而这些手段并不适合我的目的。这是第二个错误；也没有第三个错误，它不可能进入我们关于行动的推理中。因此，我问，如果一个人在这种情况下，犯了这两个错误，是否会被视为恶性和犯罪，无论这些错误是如何不可避免的？或者是否可以想象，这种错误是所有不道德的根源？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">And here it may be proper to observe, that if moral distinctions be deriv'd from the truth or falshood of those judgments, they must take place wherever we form the judgments; nor will there be any difference, whether the question be concerning an apple or a kingdom, or whether the error be avoidable or unavoidable. For as the very essence of morality is suppos'd to consist in an agreement or disagreement to reason, the other circumstances are entirely arbitrary, and can never either bestow on any action the character of virtuous or vicious, or deprive it of that character. To which we may add, that this agreement or disagreement, not admitting of degrees, all virtues and vices wou'd of course be equal.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在此，也许应该指出，如果道德上的区别来自于这些判断的真假，那么无论我们在哪里形成判断，它们都必须发生；无论问题是关于一个苹果还是一个王国，也无论错误是可以避免的还是不可避免的，都不会有任何区别。因为道德的本质被认为是由对理性的同意或不同意组成的，其他情况完全是任意的，既不能赋予任何行为以良性或恶性的特征，也不能剥夺它的这种特征。对此，我们可以补充说，这种同意或不同意，不允许有程度之分，所有的美德和恶行当然是平等的。</p></div>

'Tis certain, that an action, on many occasions, may give rise to false conclusions in others; and that a person, who thro' a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine with my neighbour's wife, may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my own. In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood; only with this difference, which is material, that I perform not the action with any intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another, but merely to satisfy my lust and passion. It causes, however, a mistake and false judgment by accident; and the falshood of its effects may be ascribed, by some odd figurative way of speaking, to the action itself.

		<p class="block_6 en">If the thought and understanding were alone capable of fixing the boundaries of right and wrong, the character of virtuous and vicious either must lie in some relations of objects, or must be a matter of fact, which is discovered by our reasoning. This consequence is evident. As the operations of human understanding divide themselves into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of fact; were virtue discover'd by the understanding; it must be an object of one of these operations, nor is there any third operation of the understanding, which can discover it. There has been an opinion very industriously propagated by certain philosophers, that morality is susceptible of demonstration; and tho' no one has ever been able to advance a single step in those demonstrations; yet 'tis taken for granted, that this science may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra. Upon this supposition, vice and virtue must consist in some relations; since 'tis allow'd on all hands, that no matter of fact is capable of being demonstrated. Let us, therefore, begin with examining this hypothesis, and endeavour, if possible, to fix those moral qualities, which have been so long the objects of our fruitless researches. Point out distinctly the relations, which constitute morality or obligation, that we may know wherein they consist, and after what manner we must judge of them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">如果只有思想和理解力能够确定正确和错误的界限，那么美德和恶德的特征要么必须存在于某些对象的关系中，要么必须是一个事实，由我们的推理来发现。这个结果是很明显的。由于人类理解力的操作分为两种，一种是观念的比较，另一种是事实的推断；如果美德是由理解力发现的，那么它一定是这些操作中的一个对象，也不存在任何第三种理解力的操作，可以发现它。某些哲学家一直在努力宣传一种观点，即道德是可以被证明的；尽管没有人能够在这些证明中前进一步；但人们认为这是理所当然的，这门科学可以达到与几何或代数同样的确定性。根据这一假设，罪恶和美德必须有某种关系；因为大家都认为，任何事实都是可以证明的。因此，让我们从研究这个假设开始，如果可能的话，努力确定那些道德品质，这些道德品质长期以来一直是我们无果的研究对象。明确指出构成道德或义务的关系，以便我们知道它们在哪里，以及我们必须以何种方式来判断它们。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Shou'd it be asserted, that the sense of morality consists in the discovery of some relation, distinct from these, and that our enumeration was not compleat, when we comprehended all demonstrable relations under four general heads: To this I know not what to reply, till some one be so good as to point out to me this new relation.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I must, therefore, on this occasion, rest contented with requiring the two following conditions of any one that wou'd undertake to clear up this system. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, As moral good and evil belong only to the actions of the mind, and are deriv'd from our situation with regard to external objects, the relations, from which these moral distinctions arise, must lie only betwixt internal actions, and external objects, and must not be applicable either to internal actions, compared among themselves, or to external objects, when placed in opposition to other external objects. For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations, if these relations cou'd belong to internal actions consider'd singly, it wou'd follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent of our situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if these moral relations cou'd be apply'd to external objects, it wou'd follow, that even inanimate beings wou'd be susceptible of moral beauty and deformity. Now it seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can be discover'd betwixt our passions, volitions and actions, compared to external objects, which relation might not belong either to these passions and volitions, or to these external objects, compar'd among <i class="calibre10">themselves</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在这种情况下，我必须满足于要求任何承诺澄清这一体系的人具备以下两个条件。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，由于道德上的善与恶只属于心灵的行动，而且是由我们对外部物体的情况派生出来的，因此，产生这些道德区别的关系必须只存在于内部行动和外部物体之间，而且既不适用于内部行动之间的比较，也不适用于外部物体与其他外部物体的对比。因为道德被认为与某些关系有关，如果这些关系属于单独考虑的内部行为，那么就会出现这样的情况，即我们可能在自己身上犯了罪，而且与我们的情况无关，与宇宙有关。同样，如果这些道德关系可以适用于外部物体，那么，即使是无生命的生物，也会有道德上的美和畸形的可能性。现在似乎很难想象，在我们的激情、意志和行动之间可以发现任何关系，与外部物体相比，这种关系可能既不属于这些激情和意志，也不属于这些外部物体<i class="calibre10">之间</i>的比较。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But it will be still more difficult to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">second</i> condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the principles of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral good and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, 'tis not only suppos'd, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the same, when consider'd by every rational creature, but their effects are also suppos'd to be necessarily the same; and 'tis concluded they have no less, or rather a greater, influence in directing the will of the deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own species. These two particulars are evidently distinct. 'Tis one thing to know virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws, <i class="calibre10">obligatory</i> on every rational mind, 'tis not sufficient to shew the relations upon which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt the relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so necessary, that in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have its influence; tho' the difference betwixt these minds be in other respects immense and infinite. Now besides what I have already prov'd, that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any action; besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in treating of the understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect, such as this is suppos'd to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the simple consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe, consider'd in themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each other. 'Tis only by experience we learn their influence and connexion; and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience. Thus it will be impossible to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">first</i> condition required to the system of eternal rational measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible to shew those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded: And 'tis as impossible to fulfil the <i class="calibre10">second</i> condition; because we cannot prove <i class="calibre10">a priori</i>, that these relations, if they really existed and were perceiv'd, wou'd be universally forcible and obligatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但要满足<i class="calibre10">第二个</i>条件就更难了，这是证明这一制度合理的必要条件。根据那些坚持在道德上的善与恶之间存在抽象的理性差异，以及事物的自然适合与不适合之间的原则，我们不仅认为这些关系是永恒不变的，在每个有理性的生物看来都是一样的，而且它们的效果也被认为必然是一样的；我们的结论是，它们在指导神的意志方面的影响不比在管理我们人类的理性和道德方面的影响小，或者说更大。这两个特点显然是不同的。了解美德是一回事，使意志符合美德是另一回事。因此，为了证明对与错的衡量标准是永恒的法则，对每一个有理性的人都是<i class="calibre10">强制性的</i>，仅仅说明它们所依据的关系是不够的。我们还必须指出关系和意志之间的联系；并且必须证明这种联系是如此必要，以至于在每一个有理智的头脑中，它必须发生并产生影响；尽管这些头脑之间的差异在其他方面是巨大的和无限的。现在，除了我已经证明的，即使在人性中，也没有任何关系可以单独产生任何行动；除此之外，我说，在处理理解力时，已经证明没有任何因果关系，如这一假设，可以通过经验以外的方式发现，而且我们可以假装通过对对象的简单考虑来获得任何安全。宇宙中的所有生命，就其本身而言，似乎完全是松散的，相互独立的。只有通过经验，我们才能了解它们的影响和联系；而这种影响我们永远不应该超越经验。因此，我们不可能满足永恒理性的是非衡量体系所要求的<i class="calibre10">第一个</i>条件；因为我们不可能显示出这些关系，而这种区分可能建立在这些关系之上。同样不可能满足<i class="calibre10">第二个</i>条件；因为我们无法<i class="calibre10">先验</i>地证明这些关系，如果它们真的存在并被感知到，就会是普遍的强制和义务。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But to make these general reflections more clear and convincing, we may illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of moral good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death. This is acknowledge'd by all mankind, philosophers as well as the people; the question only arises among philosophers, whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be discover'd by demonstrative reasoning, or be felt by an internal sense, and by means of some sentiment, which the reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This question will soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the same relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas, and the discovery of their relations; and if the same relations have different characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters are not discover' d merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to this trial, let us chuse any inanimate object, such as an oak or elm; and let us suppose, that by the dropping of its seed, it produces a sapling below it, which springing up by degrees, at last overtops and destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this instance there be wanting any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or ingratitude? Is not the one tree the cause of the other's existence; and the latter the cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a child murders his parent? 'Tis not sufficient to reply, that a choice or will is wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give rise to any <i class="calibre10">different</i> relations, but is only the cause from which the action is deriv'd; and consequently produces the <i class="calibre10">same</i> relations, that in the oak or elm arise from some other principles. 'Tis a will or choice, that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of matter and motion, that determine a sapling to destroy the oak, from which it sprung. Here then the same relations have different causes; but still the relations are the same: And as their discovery is not in both cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion does not arise from such a discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，为了使这些一般性的思考更加清晰和令人信服，我们可以通过一些特殊的例子来说明，在这些例子中，这种道德上的善或恶的特征是最普遍的。在人类能够犯下的所有罪行中，最可怕和最不自然的是忘恩负义，特别是当它对父母犯下的时候，并出现在更明显的伤口和死亡的例子中。这一点是全人类都承认的，哲学家和人民都承认；问题只是在哲学家中出现了，这种行为的罪过或道德畸形是通过证明性推理发现的，还是通过内在的感觉，通过对这种行为的反思自然产生的某种情感来感受的。如果我们能在其他物体中显示出同样的关系，而没有任何罪过或不公正的概念，那么这个问题很快就会被判定为反对前者的意见。理性或科学只不过是对观念进行比较，并发现它们之间的关系；如果同样的关系有不同的特征，那么显然就会发现，这些特征并不只是由理性发现的。因此，为了对这一事件进行试验，让我们选择任何无生命的物体，如橡树或榆树；让我们假设，由于它的种子掉落，它下面产生了一棵树苗，这棵树逐渐长大，最后压倒并摧毁了母树。我想问，在这种情况下，是否缺少任何关系，而这种关系是可以从弑君或忘恩负义中发现的？难道这棵树不是另一棵树存在的原因，而后者则是前者毁灭的原因，就像孩子谋杀父母一样？回答说缺乏选择或意愿是不够的。因为在弑君的情况下，意志并不产生任何<i class="calibre10">不同的</i>关系，而只是行为产生的原因；因此产生的关系与橡树或榆树产生于其他原则的关系<i class="calibre10">相同</i>。这是一种意志或选择，决定了一个人要杀死他的父母；它们是物质和运动的规律，决定了一棵树苗要摧毁它所产生的橡树。在这里，同样的关系有不同的原因；但这些关系仍然是相同的：由于它们的发现在这两种情况下都没有伴随着不道德的概念，因此，这种概念并不是由这种发现产生的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But to chuse an instance, still more resembling; I would fain ask any one, why incest in the human species is criminal, and why the very same action, and the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and deformity? If it be answer'd, that this action is innocent in animals, because they have not reason sufficient to discover its turpitude; but that man, being endow'd with that faculty, which <i class="calibre10">ought</i> to restrain him to his duty, the same action instantly becomes criminal to him; should this be said, I would reply, that this is evidently arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this turpitude, the turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the decisions of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect. According to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and appetite, and will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the same virtues and vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human creatures. All the difference is, that our superior reason may serve to discover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame or praise: But still this discovery supposes a separate being in these moral distinctions, and a being, which depends only on the will and appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be distinguish'd from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the same relations, with respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore wou'd also be susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality consisted in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality, but can never hinder these duties from existing; since they must antecedently exist, in order to their being perceiv'd. Reason must find them, and can never produce them. This argument deserves to be weigh'd, as being, in my opinion, entirely decisive.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但要选择一个更相似的例子；我很想问任何人，为什么人类的乱伦是犯罪，而同样的行为和同样的关系在动物身上却没有丝毫的道德败坏和畸形？如果有人回答说，这种行为在动物身上是无罪的，因为它们没有足够的理智来发现它的污秽；但人由于被赋予了那种<i class="calibre10">应该</i>约束他的职责的能力，同样的行为对他来说立刻就变成了犯罪；如果这样说，我想回答说，这显然是在兜圈子的说法。因为在理性能够觉察到这种不道德行为之前，这种不道德行为必须存在；因此，它与我们理性的决定无关，是它们的目标，而不是它们的效果。那么，根据这个系统，每一种动物，只要有感觉，有食欲，有意志；也就是说，每一种动物都必须有所有相同的美德和恶习，我们为这些美德和恶习赋予人类生物以褒贬。所有的区别在于，我们的高级理性可以用来发现恶习或美德，并通过这种方式来增加责备或赞美。但这种发现仍然假定在这些道德区别中存在着一种独立的存在，而且这种存在只取决于意志和食欲，而且在思想和现实中都可以与理性区分开来。动物与人类之间的关系是相同的，因此，如果道德的本质包含在这些关系中，它们也会受到相同的道德的影响。他们缺乏足够的理性，可能会妨碍他们认识到道德的责任和义务，但绝不可能妨碍这些责任的存在；因为它们必须先存在，才能被认识到。理性必须找到它们，但永远无法产生它们。这个论点值得权衡，因为在我看来，它是完全决定性的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any relations, that are the objects of science; but if examin'd, will prove with equal certainty, that it consists not in any <i class="calibre10">matter of fact</i>, which can be discover'd by the understanding. This is the <i class="calibre10">second</i> part of our argument; and if it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of reason. But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason? Take any action allow'd to be vicious: Wilful murder, for instance. Examine it in all lights, and see if you can find that matter of fact, or real existence, which you call <i class="calibre10">vice</i>. In which-ever way you take it, you find only certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object. You never can find it, till you turn your reflection into your own breast, and find a sentiment of disapprobation, which arises in you, towards this action. Here is a matter of fact; but 'tis the object of feeling, not of reason. It lies in yourself, not in the object. So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compar'd to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind: And this discovery in morals, like that other in physics, is to be regarded as a considerable advancement of the speculative sciences; tho', like that too, it has little or no influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us more, than our own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite to the regulation of our conduct and behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个推理也不仅仅证明，道德不包括任何关系，而这些关系是科学的对象；但如果加以研究，将同样肯定地证明，它不包括任何<i class="calibre10">事实问题</i>，而这些<i class="calibre10">事实问题</i>是可以通过理解力发现的。这是我们论证的<i class="calibre10">第二</i>部分；如果它能被证明，我们可以得出结论，道德不是理性的对象。但是，要证明罪恶和美德不是我们可以通过理性推断出的事实问题，还有什么困难吗？以任何被认为是邪恶的行为为例：比如说，故意杀人。从各种角度来审视它，看看你是否能找到你所说的<i class="calibre10">恶行</i>的事实或真实存在。无论你以何种方式看待它，你都只能找到某些激情、动机、意志和思想。在这种情况下，不存在其他的事实问题。只要你考虑对象，恶习就完全逃不过你的眼睛。你永远也找不到它，直到你把你的思考转向你自己的胸膛，发现在你心中产生的对这种行为的不赞成的情绪。这是一个事实；但这是感觉的对象，不是理性的对象。它在于你自己，而不在于对象。因此，当你宣称任何行为或性格是邪恶的，你没有任何意思，只是从你的天性结构来看，你在思考它时有一种责备的感觉或情绪。因此，邪恶和美德可以被比作声音、颜色、热和冷，根据现代哲学，它们不是物体的品质，而是心灵的感知。在道德方面的这一发现，就像在物理学方面的其他发现一样，应被视为投机科学的一大进步；尽管也像物理学一样，它对实践几乎没有影响。没有什么比我们自己的快乐和不安的情绪更真实，也没有什么比这更让我们关心的了；如果这些情绪对美德有利，对恶习不利，那么对于规范我们的行为和举止就没有什么必要了。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may, perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, <i class="calibre10">is</i>, and <i class="calibre10">is not</i>, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an <i class="calibre10">ought</i>, or an <i class="calibre10">ought not</i>. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this <i class="calibre10">ought</i>, or <i class="calibre10">ought not</i>, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv'd by reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我忍不住要在这些推理中加入一个观点，也许会发现它有一定的重要性。在我迄今为止遇到的每一个道德体系中，我总是注意到，作者以普通的推理方式进行了一段时间，确定了上帝的存在，或对人类事务进行了观察；突然间，我惊讶地发现，我没有看到通常的命题交配，<i class="calibre10">是</i>和<i class="calibre10">不是</i>，而是没有一个命题不与<i class="calibre10">应该</i>或<i class="calibre10">不应该</i>相关联。这种变化是难以察觉的，但却是最后的结果。因为这个 "<i class="calibre10">应该</i>"或 "<i class="calibre10">不应该</i>"表达了某种新的关系或肯定，所以有必要对其进行观察和解释；同时还应该给出一个理由，说明这种新的关系是如何从与之完全不同的其他关系中演绎出来的，这似乎是完全不可想象的。但是，由于作者通常不使用这种预防措施，我将冒昧地向读者推荐它；我相信，这种小小的关注将颠覆所有庸俗的道德体系，并让我们看到，罪恶和美德的区别并不仅仅建立在物体的关系上，也不是由理性来感知的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus the course of the argument leads us to conclude, that since vice and virtue are not discoverable merely by reason, or the comparison of ideas, it must be by means of some impression or sentiment they occasion, that we are able to mark the difference betwixt them. Our decisions concerning moral rectitude and depravity are evidently perceptions; and as all perceptions are either impressions or ideas, the exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the other. Morality, therefore, is more properly felt than judg'd of; tho' this feeling or sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle, that we are apt to confound it with an idea, according to our common custom of taking all things for the same, which have any near resemblance to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，论证的过程使我们得出结论，既然恶习和美德不能仅仅通过理性或观念的比较来发现，那么就必须通过它们所引起的某种印象或情感，我们才能标明它们之间的区别。我们关于道德正确和堕落的决定显然是一种感知；由于所有的感知要么是印象，要么是观念，排除其中的一个就是另一个有说服力的论据。因此，道德与其说是判断，不如说是感觉；尽管这种感觉或情感通常是如此柔和，以至于我们很容易把它与观念混为一谈，根据我们把所有事物视为同一事物的共同习惯，只要彼此有任何相似之处。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The next question is, Of what nature are these impressions, and after what manner do they operate upon us? Here we cannot remain long in suspense, but must pronounce the impression arising from virtue, to be agreeable, and that proceeding from vice to be uneasy. Every moment's experience must convince us of this. There is no spectacle so fair and beautiful as a noble and generous action; nor any which gives us more abhorrence than one that is cruel and treacherous. No enjoyment equals the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be oblig'd to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may afford us instances of this pleasure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain, which arises from vice.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">接下来的问题是，这些印象是什么性质的，它们以什么方式作用于我们？在这里，我们不能长期悬而未决，而必须宣布由美德产生的印象是令人满意的，而由恶习产生的印象则是令人不安的。每一刻的经验都必须使我们相信这一点。没有什么景象比高尚和慷慨的行为更公平和美丽；也没有什么景象比残忍和奸诈的行为更让我们厌恶。没有任何享受能与我们从我们所爱的人和所尊敬的人的陪伴中得到的满足相提并论；因为所有惩罚中最大的惩罚就是不得不与我们所憎恨或谴责的人一起度过一生。一部戏剧或罗曼史都可以为我们提供这样的例子：美德给我们带来的快乐，以及由恶习产生的痛苦。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now since the distinguishing impressions, by which moral good or evil is known, are nothing but <i class="calibre10">particular</i> pains or pleasures; it follows, that in all enquiries concerning these moral distinctions, it will be sufficient to shew the principles, which make us feel a satisfaction or uneasiness from the survey of any character, in order to satisfy us why the character is laudable or blameable. An action, or sentiment, or character is virtuous or vicious; why? because its view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind. In giving a reason, therefore, for the pleasure or uneasiness, we sufficiently explain the vice or virtue. To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to <i class="calibre10">feel</i> a satisfaction of a particular kind from the contemplation of a character. The very <i class="calibre10">feeling</i> constitutes our praise or admiration. We go no farther; nor do we enquire into the cause of the satisfaction. We do not infer a character to be virtuous, because it pleases: But in feeling that it pleases after such a particular manner, we in effect feel that it is virtuous. The case is the same as in our judgments conceding all kinds of beauty, and tastes, and sensations. Our approbation is imply'd in the immediate pleasure they convey to us.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，在所有关于这些道德区别的调查中，只要说明使我们从对任何性格的观察中感到满意或不安的原则，就足以让我们知道为什么这个性格是值得赞扬的或可责备的。一个行为，或情感，或性格是美德的或恶毒的；为什么？ 因为它的观点会引起一种特定的快乐或不安。因此，在给出快乐或不安的理由时，我们就充分地解释了恶行或美德。拥有美德的感觉，无非是从对一个人物的沉思中<i class="calibre10">感受到</i>一种特殊的满足。这种<i class="calibre10">感觉</i>构成了我们的赞美或钦佩。我们没有走得更远；我们也没有探究这种满足的原因。我们不会因为一个人物让我们高兴而推断它是有德行的。但是，在感觉到它以这样一种特殊的方式取悦于人时，我们实际上就感觉到它是有德行的。这种情况与我们对各种美感、品味和感觉的判断是一样的。我们的赞许隐含在它们给我们带来的直接快乐中。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I have objected to the system, which establishes eternal rational measures of right and wrong, that 'tis impossible to shew, in the actions of reasonable creatures, any relations, which are not found in external objects; and therefore, if morality always attended these relations, 'twere possible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or vicious. Now it may, in like manner, be objected to the present system, that if virtue and vice be determin'd by pleasure and pain, these qualities must, in every case, arise from the sensations; and consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite a satisfaction or uneasiness. But tho' this objection seems to be the very same, it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in the other. For, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, 'tis evident, that under the term <i class="calibre10">pleasure</i>, we comprehend sensations, which are very different from each other, and which have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite to make them be express'd by the same abstract term. A good composition of music and a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and what is more, their goodness is determin'd merely by the pleasure. But shall we say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or sentiments of any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as the satisfaction is different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them from being confounded, and makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not to the other. Nor is every sentiment of pleasure or pain, which arises from characters and actions, of that <i class="calibre10">peculiar</i> kind, which makes us praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are hurtful to us; but may still command our esteem and respect. 'Tis only when a character is considered in general, without reference to our particular interest, that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally good or evil. 'Tis true, those sentiments, from interest and morals, are apt to be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our interest and real villainy or baseness. But this hinders not, but that the sentiments are, in themselves, distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may preserve himself from these illusions. In like manner, tho' 'tis certain a musical voice is nothing but one that naturally gives a <i class="calibre10">particular</i> kind of pleasure; yet 'tis difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an enemy is agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear, who has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise to what deserves it.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the passions, in order to remark a still more considerable difference among our pains and pleasures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the passion. Now virtue and vice are attended with these circumstances. They must necessarily be plac'd either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure or uneasiness; and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from inanimate objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is, perhaps, the most considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind.</p>

For as the number of our duties is, in a manner, infinite, 'tis impossible that our original instincts should extend to each of them, and from our very first infancy impress on the human mind all that multitude of precepts, which are contain'd in the completest system of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to the usual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles produce all that variety we observe in the universe, and every thing is carry'd on in the easiest and most simple manner.

Frequent and rare depend upon the number of examples we have observ'd; and as this number may gradually encrease or diminish, 'twill be impossible to fix any exact boundaries betwixt them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was any thing, which cou'd be call'd natural in this sense, the sentiments of morality certainly may; since there never was any nation of the world, nor any single person in any nation, who was utterly depriv'd of them, and who never, in any instance, shew'd the least approbation or dislike of manners.

Shou'd it, therefore, be demanded, whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial, I am of opinion, that 'tis impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to this question. Perhaps it will appear afterwards, that our sense of some virtues is artificial, and that of others natural.

For in the first sense of the word, Nature, as opposed to miracles, both vice and virtue are equally natural; and in the second sense, as oppos'd to what is unusual, perhaps virtue will be found to be the most unnatural. At least it must be own'd, that heroic virtue, being as unusual, is as little natural as the most brutal barbarity. As to the third sense of the word, 'tis certain, that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of nature. For however it may be disputed, whether the notion of a merit or demerit in certain actions be natural or artificial, 'tis evident, that the actions themselves are artificial, and are perform'd with a certain design and intention; otherwise they cou'd never be rank'd under any of these denominations. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that the character of natural and unnatural can ever, in any sense, mark the boundaries of vice and virtue.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus we are still brought back to our first position, that virtue is distinguished by the pleasure, and vice by the pain, that any action, sentiment or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation.

		<p class="block_6 en">It appears, therefore, that all virtuous actions derive their merit only from virtuous motives, and are consider'd merely as signs of those motives. From this principle I conclude, that the first virtuous motive, which bestows a merit on any action, can never be a regard to the virtue of that action, but must be some other natural motive or principle. To suppose, that the mere regard to the virtue of the action, may be the first motive, which produc'd the action, and render'd it virtuous, is to reason in a circle. Before we can have such a regard, the action must be really virtuous; and this virtue must be deriv'd from some virtuous motive: And consequently the virtuous motive must be different from the regard to the virtue of the action. A virtuous motive is requisite to render an action virtuous. An action must be virtuous, before we em have a regard to its virtue.

A man that really feels no gratitude in his temper, is still pleas'd to perform grateful actions, and thinks he has, by that means, fulfill'd his duty. Actions are at first only consider'd as signs of motives: But 'tis usual, in this case, as in all others, to fix our attention on the signs, and neglect, in some measure, the thing signify'd.

		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，难道道德感或责任感不可能在没有任何其他动机的情况下产生一种行动吗？我回答说，可以。但这并不反对目前的学说。当任何美德的动机或原则在人性中普遍存在时，一个人如果觉得自己的内心缺乏这种动机，就可能因此而憎恨自己，并可能出于某种责任感而在没有动机的情况下实施行动，以便通过实践获得这种美德的原则，或者至少尽可能地向自己掩饰他缺乏这种原则的事实。一个人如果在他的脾气中真的没有感激之情，他仍然乐意做感激之事，并认为他已经通过这种方式履行了他的职责。行为起初只是被认为是动机的标志。但是，在这种情况下，就像在所有其他情况下一样，我们通常会把注意力放在迹象上，而在某种程度上忽略了所象征的东西。但是，尽管在某些情况下，一个人可能仅仅出于道德上的义务而采取某种行动，但这仍然假定在人性中存在一些独特的原则，这些原则能够产生这种行动，其道德上的美感使这种行动成为有价值的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Now to apply all this to the present case; I suppose a person to have lent me a sum of money, on condition that it be restor'd in a few days; and also suppose, that after the expiration of the term agreed on, he demands the sum: I ask, <i class="calibre10">What reason or motive have I to restore the money?</i> It will, perhaps, be said, that my regard to justice, and abhorrence of villainy and knavery, are sufficient reasons for me, if I have the least grain of honesty, or sense of duty and obligation. And this answer, no doubt, is just and satisfactory to man in his civiliz'd state, and when train'd up according to a certain discipline and education. But in his rude and more <i class="calibre10">natural</i> condition, if you are pleas'd to call such a condition natural, this answer wou'd be rejected as perfectly unintelligible and sophistical. For one in that situation wou'd immediately ask you, <i class="calibre10">Wherein consists this honesty and justice, which you find in restoring a loan, and abstaining from the property of others?</i> It does not surely lie in the external action. It must, therefore, be plac'd in the motive, from which the external action is deriv'd. This motive can never be a regard to the honesty of the action. For 'tis a plain fallacy to say, that a virtuous motive is requisite to render an action honest, and at the same time that a regard to the honesty is the motive of the action. We can never have a regard to the virtue of an action, unless the action be antecedently virtuous. No action can be virtuous, but so far as it proceeds from a virtuous motive. A virtuous motive, therefore, must precede the regard to the virtue; and 'tis impossible, that the virtuous motive and the regard to the virtue can be the same.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, it may be affirm'd, that there is no such passion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, of services, or of relation to ourself. 'Tis true, there is no human, and indeed no sensible, creature, whose happiness or misery does not, in some measure, affect us, when brought near to us, and represented in lively colours: But this proceeds merely from sympathy, and is no proof of such an universal affection to mankind, since this concern extends itself beyond our own species. An affection betwixt the sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature; and this passion not only appears in its peculiar symptoms, but also in inflaming every other principle of affection, and raising a stronger love from beauty, wit, kindness, than what wou'd otherwise flow from them. Were there an universal love among all human creatures, it wou'd appear after the same manner. Any degree of a good quality wou'd cause a stronger affection than the same degree of a bad quality wou'd cause hatred; contrary to what we find by experience. Men's tempers are different, and some have a propensity to the tender, and others to the rougher, affections: But in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is nothing but the object both of love and hatred, and requires some other cause, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas, may excite these passions. In vain wou'd we endeavour to elude this hypothesis. There are no phænomena that point out any such kind affection to men, independent of their merit, and every other circumstance. We love company in general; but 'tis as we love any other amusement. An <i class="calibre10">Englishman</i> in <i class="calibre10">Italy</i> is a friend: A <i class="calibre10">European</i> in <i class="calibre10">China</i>; and perhaps a man wou'd be belov'd as such, were we to meet him in the moon.

Tis according to their general force in human nature, that we blame or praise. In judging of the beauty of animal bodies, we always carry in our eye the economy of a certain species; and where the limbs and features observe that proportion, which is common to the species, we pronounce them handsome and beautiful. In like manner we always consider the natural and usual force of the passions, when we determine concerning vice and virtue; and if the passions depart very much from the common measures on either side, they are always disapprove'd as vicious. A man naturally loves his children better than his nephews, his nephews better than his cousins, his cousins better than strangers, where every thing else is equal.

In other creatures these two particulars generally compensate each other. If we consider the lion as a voracious and carnivorous animal, we shall easily discover him to be very necessitous; but if we tum our eye to his make and temper, his agility, his courage, his arms, and his force, we shall find, that his advantages hold proportion with his wants.

Most fortunately, therefore, there is conjoin'd to those necessities, whose remedies are remote and obscure, another necessity, which having a present and more obvious remedy, may justly be regarded as the first and original principle of human society. This necessity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the sexes, which unites them together, and preserves their union, till a new tye takes place in their concern for their common offspring. This new concern becomes also a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a more numerous society; where the parents govern by the advantage of their superior strength and wisdom, and at the same time are restrain'd in the exercise of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their children. In a little time, custom and habit operating on the tender minds of the children, makes them sensible of the advantages, which they may reap from society, as well as fashions them by degrees for it, by rubbing off those rough corners and untoward affections, which prevent their coalition.</p>

So far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves, I am of opinion, that tho' it be rare to meet with one, who loves any single person better than himself; yet 'tis as rare to meet with one, in whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not over-balance all the selfish. Consult common experience: Do you not see, that tho' the whole expence of the family be generally under the direction of the master of it, yet there are few that do not bestow the largest part of their fortunes on the pleasures of their wives, and the education of their children, reserving the smallest portion for their own proper use and entertainment. This is what we may observe concerning such as have those endearing ties; and may presume, that the case would be the same with others, were they plac'd in a like situation. But tho' this generosity must be acknowledge'd to the honour of human nature, we may at the same time remark, that so noble an affection, instead of fitting men for large societies, is almost as contrary to them, as the most narrow selfishness. For while each person loves himself better than any other single person, and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance, this must necessarily produce an opposition of passions, and a consequent opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the new-establish'd union.</p>

We are perfectly secure in the enjoyment of the first. The second may be ravish'd from us, but can be of no advantage to him who deprives us of them. The last only are both expos'd to the violence of others, and may be transfer'd without suffering any loss or alteration; while at the same time, there is not a sufficient quantity of them to supply every one's desires and necessities.

The idea of justice can never serve to this purpose, or be taken for a natural principle, capable of inspiring men with an equitable conduct towards each other. That virtue, as it is now understood, wou'd never have been dream'd of among rude and savage men. For the notion of injury or injustice implies an immorality or vice committed against some other person: And as every immorality is deriv'd from some defect or unsoundness of the passions, and as this defect must be judg'd of, in a great measure, from the ordinary course of nature in the constitution of the mind; 'twill be easy to know, whether we be guilty of any immorality, with regard to others, by considering the natural, and usual force of those several affections, which are directed towards them. Now it appears, that in the original frame of our mind, our strongest attention is confin'd to ourselves; our next is extended to our relations and acquaintance; and 'tis only the weakest which reaches to strangers and indifferent persons. This partiality, then, and unequal affection, must not only have an influence on our behaviour and conduct in society, but even on our ideas of vice and virtue; so as to make us regard any remarkable transgression of such a degree of partiality, either by too great an enlargement, or contraction of the affections, as vicious and immoral. This we may observe in our common judgments concerning actions, where we blame a person, who either centers all his affections in his family, or is so regardless of them, as, in any opposition of interest, to give the preference to a stranger, or mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural uncultivated ideas of morality, instead of providing a remedy for the partiality of our affections, do rather conform themselves to that partiality, and give it an additional force and influence.</p>

For when men, from their early education in society, have become sensible of the infinite advantages that result from it, and have besides acquir'd a new affection to company and conversation; and when they have observ'd, that the principal disturbance in society arises from those goods, which we call external, and from their looseness and easy transition from one person to another; they must seek for a remedy, by putting these goods, as far as possible, on the same footing with the fix'd and constant advantages of the mind and body. This can be done after no other manner, than by a convention enter'd into by all the members of the society to bestow stability on the possession of those external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and industry. By this means, every one knows what he may safely possess; and the passions are restrain'd in their partial and contradictory motions. Nor is such a restraint contrary to these passions; for if so, it cou'd never be enter'd into, nor maintain'd; but it is only contrary to their heedless and impetuous movement. Instead of departing from our own interest, or from that of our nearest friends, by abstaining from the possessions of others, we cannot better consult both these interests, than by such a convention; because it is by that means we maintain society, which is so necessary to their well-being and subsistence, as well as to our own.</p>

I observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the possession of his goods, <i class="calibre10">provided</i> he will act in the same manner with regard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of his conduct. When this common sense of interest is mutually express'd, and is known to both, it produces a suitable resolution and behaviour.

Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the stability of possession the less deriv'd from human conventions, that it arises gradually, and acquires force by a slow progression, and by our repeated experience of the inconveniences of transgressing it. On the contrary, this experience assures us still more, that the sense of interest has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and abstinence are founded.

A man's property is some object related to him. This relation is not natural, but moral, and founded on justice. 'Tis very preposterous, therefore, to imagine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully comprehending the nature of justice, and shewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of men.

Benevolence to strangers is too weak for this purpose; and as to the other passions, they rather inflame this avidity, when we observe, that the larger our possessions are, the more ability we have of gratifying all our appetites. There is no passion, therefore, capable of controlling the interested affection, but the very affection itself, by an alteration of its direction. Now this alteration must necessarily take place upon the least reflection; since 'tis evident, that the passion is much better satisfy'd by its restraint, than by its liberty, and that in preserving society, we make much greater advances in the acquiring possessions, than in the solitary and forlorn condition, which must follow upon violence and an universal licence. The question, therefore, concerning the wickedness or goodness of human nature, enters not in the least into that other question concerning the origin of society; nor is there any thing to be consider'd but the degrees of men's sagacity or folly. For whether the passion of self-interest be esteemed vicious or virtuous, 'tis all a case; since itself alone restrains it: So that if it be virtuous, men become social by their virtue; if vicious, their vice has the same effect.</p>

Human nature being compos'd of two principal parts, which are requisite in all its actions, the affections and understanding; 'tis certain, that the blind motions of the former, without the direction of the latter, incapacitate men for society: And it may be allow'd us to consider separately the effects, that result from the separate operations of these two component parts of the mind.

They easily perceiv'd, if every man had a tender regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires, that the jealousy of interest, which justice supposes, could no longer have place; nor would there be any occasion for those distinctions and limits of property and possession, which at present are in use among mankind. Encrease to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues, and more valuable blessings.

		<p class="block_6 en">Nor need we have recourse to the fictions of poets to learn this; but beside the reason of the thing, may discover the same truth by common experience and observation. 'Tis easy to remark, that a cordial affection renders all things common among friends; and that married people in particular mutually lose their property, and are unacquainted with the <i class="calibre10">mine</i> and <i class="calibre10">thine</i>, which are so necessary, and yet cause such disturbance in human society. The same effect arises from any alteration in the circumstances of mankind; as when there is such a plenty of any thing as satisfies all the desires of men: In which case the distinction of property is entirely lost, and every thing remains in common. This we may observe with regard to air and water, tho' the most valuable of all external objects; and may easily conclude, that if men were supplied with every thing in the same abundance, or if <i class="calibre10">every one</i> had the same affection and tender regard for <i class="calibre10">every one</i> as for himself; justice and injustice would be equally unknown among mankind.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们也不必求助于诗人的虚构来了解这一点；除了事情的原因之外，还可以通过普通的经验和观察发现同样的真理。我们不难发现，亲切的感情使朋友之间的一切都变得共同了；尤其是已婚人士相互失去了他们的财产，并且不了解<i class="calibre10">我的</i>和<i class="calibre10">你的</i>，这在人类社会中是如此必要，但却造成了如此的混乱。人类环境的任何改变都会产生同样的效果；比如说，当任何东西都能满足人们的所有欲望时，就会出现这种充足的情况。在这种情况下，财产的区别就完全消失了，所有的东西都是共同的。我们可以在空气和水方面观察到这一点，虽然它们是所有外部物品中最有价值的；并且可以很容易地得出结论，如果人们以同样丰富的方式获得每样东西，或者如果<i class="calibre10">每个人</i>对<i class="calibre10">每个人</i>都有同样的感情和温柔的关怀，那么正义和不正义在人类中也会同样不存在。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Here then is a proposition, which, I think, may be regarded as certain, <i class="calibre10">that 'tis only from the selfishness and confin'd generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin</i>. If we look backward we shall find, that this proposition bestows an additional force on some of those observations, which we have already made on this subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这里有一个命题，我认为它可以被看作是确定的，<i class="calibre10">即 "只有从人的自私和狭隘的慷慨，以及自然界为他的需求所提供的微薄供给中，才有了正义的起源</i>。如果我们向后看，我们会发现，这个命题给我们在这个问题上已经提出的一些意见带来了额外的力量。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">First</i>, we may conclude from it, that a regard to public interest, or a strong extensive benevolence, is not our first and original motive for the observation of the rules of justice; since 'tis allow'd, that if men were endow'd with such a benevolence, these rules would never have been dreamt of.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">首先</i>，我们可以从中得出结论，对公共利益的关注，或强烈的广泛的仁爱之心，并不是我们遵守正义规则的第一和最初的动机；因为我们允许，如果人们被赋予这样的仁爱之心，这些规则就不会被梦想出来。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, we may conclude from the same principle, that the sense of justice is not founded on reason, or on the discovery of certain connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and universally obligatory. For since it is confest, that such an alteration as that above-mention'd, in the temper and circumstances of mankind, wou'd entirely alter our duties and obligations, 'tis necessary upon the common system, <i class="calibre10">that the sense of virtue is deriv'd from reason</i>, to shew the change which this must produce in the relations and ideas. But 'tis evident, that the only cause, why the extensive generosity of man, and the perfect abundance of every thing, wou'd destroy the very idea of justice, is because they render it useless; and that, on the other hand, his confin'd benevolence, and his necessitous condition, give rise to that virtue, only by making it requisite to the publick interest, and to that of every individual. 'Twas therefore a concern for our own, and the publick interest, which made us establish the laws of justice; and nothing can be more certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas, which gives us this concern, but our impressions and sentiments, without which every thing in nature is perfectly indifferent to us, and can never in the least affect us. The sense of justice, therefore, is not founded on our ideas, but on our impressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">其次</i>，我们可以从同一原则中得出结论，即正义感不是建立在理性上，也不是建立在发现某些观念的联系和关系上，这些观念是永恒的、不变的和普遍的义务。因为人们承认，在人类的脾气和环境中出现上述这种变化，就会完全改变我们的责任和义务，所以根据共同的制度，<i class="calibre10">即美德感来自理性</i>，就必须说明这在关系和观念中必须产生的变化。但显而易见的是，人的广泛慷慨和每样东西的完全丰富会破坏正义的概念，唯一的原因是它们使正义变得毫无用处；另一方面，他的有限的仁慈和他窘迫的状况会产生这种美德，只有通过使它对公共利益和每个人的利益都是必要的。因此，是对我们自己和公众利益的关注，使我们建立了正义的法则；没有什么比这更肯定的了，不是任何观念的关系给了我们这种关注，而是我们的印象和情感，没有这种印象和情感，自然界的每一件事对我们来说都是完全漠不关心的，而且丝毫不能影响我们。因此，正义感不是建立在我们的观念上，而是建立在我们的印象上。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, we may farther confirm the foregoing proposition, <i class="calibre10">that those impressions, which give rise to this sense of justice, are not natural to the mind of man, but arise from artifice and human conventions</i>. For since any considerable alteration of temper and circumstances destroys equally justice and injustice; and since such an alteration has an effect only by changing our own and the publick interest; it follows, that the first establishment of the rules of justice depends on these different interests. But if men pursu'd the publick interest naturally, and with a hearty affection, they wou'd never have dream'd of restraining each other by these rules; and if they pursu'd their own interest, without any precaution, they wou'd run head-long into every kind of injustice and violence. These rules, therefore, are artificial, and seek their end in an oblique and indirect manner; nor is the interest, which gives rise to them, of a kind that cou'd be pursu'd by the natural and inartificial passions of men.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">第三</i>，我们可以进一步证实前述命题，<i class="calibre10">即那些引起这种正义感的印象，并不是人的心灵所自然产生的，而是来自于人工和人类习惯</i>。因为，既然脾气和环境的任何重大改变都会同样破坏正义和非正义；既然这种改变只有通过改变我们自己和公众的利益才能产生效果；因此，正义规则的最初确立取决于这些不同的利益。但是，如果人们自然而然地追求公共利益，并且怀有深厚的感情，他们就不会梦想用这些规则来约束对方；如果他们追求自己的利益，没有任何预防措施，他们就会一头撞上各种不公正和暴力。因此，这些规则是人为的，是以一种斜的和间接的方式寻求其目的；引起这些规则的利益也不是一种可以由人的自然和非人为的激情来追求的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To make this more evident, consider, that tho' the rules of justice are establish'd merely by interest, their connexion with interest is somewhat singular, and is different from what may be observ'd on other occasions. A single act of justice is frequently contrary to <i class="calibre10">public interest</i>; and were it to stand alone, without being follow'd by other acts, may, in itse1£ be very prejudicial to society. When a man of merit, of a beneficent disposition, restores a great fortune to a miser, or a seditious bigot, he has acted justly and laudably, but the public is a real sufferer. Nor is every single act of justice, consider'd apart, more conducive to private interest, than to public; and 'tis easily conceiv'd how a man may impoverish himself by a signal instance of integrity, and have reason to wish, that with regard to that single act, the laws of justice were for a moment suspended in the universe. But however single acts of justice may be contrary, either to public or private interest, 'tis certain, that the whole plan or scheme is highly conducive, or indeed absolutely requisite, both to the support of society, and the well-being of every individual. 'Tis impossible to separate the good from the ill. Property must be stable, and must be fix'd by general rules. Tho' in one instance the public be a sufferer, this momentary ill is amply compensated by the steady prosecution of the rule, and by the peace and order, which it establishes in society. And even every individual person must find himself a gainer, on balancing the account; since, without justice, society must immediately dissolve, and every one must fall into that savage and solitary condition, which is infinitely worse than the worst situation that can possibly be suppos'd in society. When therefore men have had experience enough to observe, that whatever may be the consequence of any single act of justice, perform'd by a single person, yet the whole system of actions, concurr'd in by the whole society, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part; it is not long before justice and property take place. Every member of society is sensible of this interest: Every one expresses this sense to his fellows, along with the resolution he has taken of squaring his actions by it, on condition that others will do the same. No more is requisite to induce any one of them to perform an act of justice, who has the first opportunity. This becomes an example to others. And thus justice establishes itself by a kind of convention or agreement; that is, by a sense of interest, suppos'd to be common to all, and where every single act is perform'd in expectation that others are to perform the like. Without such a convention, no one wou'd ever have dream'd, that there was such a virtue as justice, or have been induc'd to conform his actions to it. Taking any single act, my justice may be pernicious in every respect; and 'tis only upon the supposition, that others are to imitate my example, that I can be induc'd to embrace that virtue; since nothing but this combination can render justice advantageous, or afford me any motives to conform my self to its rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了使这一点更加明显，请考虑一下，虽然正义的规则仅仅是由利益建立起来的，但它们与利益的关系有些奇怪，而且与在其他场合观察到的情况不同。单一的正义行为经常违背<i class="calibre10">公共利益</i>；如果它单独存在，而没有其他行为的跟进，那么它可能会对社会造成很大的损害。当一个有能力、有爱心的人把一大笔财富还给一个守财奴或一个煽动性的偏执者时，他的行为是公正的、值得称赞的，但公众却是一个真正的受害者。也不是每一个单一的正义行为，单独来看，都比公共利益更有利于私人利益；我们很容易想象，一个人可能会因为一个明显的正直的例子而使自己陷入贫困，并且有理由希望，就这一单一行为而言，正义的法则在宇宙中暂时中止。但是，不管单一的正义行为如何违背公共或私人利益，可以肯定的是，整个计划或方案对社会的支持和每个人的福祉都是非常有利的，甚至是绝对必要的。我们不可能把好的和坏的分开。财产必须是稳定的，而且必须由一般的规则来确定。尽管在某一情况下，公众会受到伤害，但这种短暂的伤害会因规则的稳定实施以及它在社会中建立的和平和秩序而得到充分的补偿。甚至每一个人都会发现自己是一个受益者，因为如果没有正义，社会必须立即解体，每个人都必须陷入野蛮和孤独的状态，这比社会中可能出现的最糟糕的情况还要糟糕。因此，当人们有足够的经验观察到，无论一个人的任何单一正义行为的后果如何，但整个社会的整个行动体系，对整体和每个部分都是无限有利的；不久，正义和财产就会发生。社会的每一个成员都能感受到这种利益。每个人都向他的伙伴们表达了这种意识，同时也表达了他通过这种方式来平衡自己行为的决心，条件是其他人也会这样做。不需要更多的东西来促使他们中任何一个有机会的人执行正义的行为。这就成为其他人的榜样。因此，正义通过一种惯例或协议建立起来；也就是说，通过一种被认为是所有人都有的利益感，在这种情况下，每一个人的行为都是为了期望其他人也能这样做。如果没有这样的约定，没有人会梦想有正义这样的美德，也没有人会促使他的行为符合正义的要求。以任何一个行为来说，我的正义可能在各方面都是有害的；而只有在假设别人会模仿我的榜样时，我才能被诱导去接受这种美德；因为除了这种结合，没有任何东西能使正义变得有利，或给我任何动机使我自己遵守它的规则。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">After men have found by experience, that their selfishness and confin'd generosity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate them for society; and at the same time have observ'd, that society is necessary to the satisfaction of those very passions, they are naturally induc'd to lay themselves under the restraint of such rules, as may render their commerce more safe and commodious. To the imposition then, and observance of these rules, both in general, and in every particular instance, they are at first induc'd only by a regard to interest; and this motive, on the first formation of society, is sufficiently strong and forcible. But when society has become numerous, and has encreas'd to a tribe or nation, this interest is more remote; nor do men so readily perceive, that disorder and confusion follow upon every breach of these rules, as in a more narrow and contracted society. But tho' in our own actions we may frequently lose sight of that interest, which we have in maintaining order, and may follow a lesser and more present interest, we never fail to observe the prejudice we receive, either mediately or immediately, from the injustice of others; as not being in that case either blinded by passion, or byass'd by any contrary temptation. Nay when the injustice is so distant from us, as no way to affect our interest, it still displeases us; because we consider it as prejudicial to human society, and pernicious to every one that approaches the person guilty of it. We partake of their uneasiness by <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>; and as every thing, which gives uneasiness in human actions, upon the general survey, is call'd Vice, and whatever produces satisfaction, in the same manner, is denominated Virtue; this is the reason why the sense of moral good and evil follows upon justice and injustice. And tho' this sense, in the present case, be deriv'd only from contemplating the actions of others, yet we fail not to extend it even to our own actions. The general rule reaches beyond those instances, from which it arose; while at the same time we naturally <i class="calibre10">sympathize</i> with others in the sentiments they entertain of us. <i class="calibre10">Thus self-interest is the original motive to the</i> establishment <i class="calibre10">of justice: but a</i> sympathy <i class="calibre10">with public interest is the source of the</i> moral approbation, <i class="calibre10">which attends that virtue</i>.</p>

This, no doubt, must have its effect; but nothing can be more evident, than that the matter has been carry'd too far by certain writers on morals, who seem to have employ'd their utmost efforts to extirpate all sense of virtue from among mankind. Any artifice of politicians may assist nature in the producing of those sentiments, which she suggests to us, and may even on some occasions, produce alone an approbation or esteem for any particular action; but 'tis impossible it should be the sole cause of the distinction we make betwixt vice and virtue.

		<p class="block_6 en">It follows, therefore, that the general rule, <i class="calibre10">that possession must be stable</i>, is not apply' d by particular judgments, but by other general rules, which must extend to the whole society, and be inflexible either by spite or favour. To illustrate this, I propose the following instance. I first consider men in their savage and solitary condition; and suppose, that being sensible of the misery of that state, and foreseeing the advantages that wou'd result from society, they seek each other's company, and make an offer of mutual protection and assistance. I also suppose, that they are endow'd with such sagacity as immediately to perceive, that the chief impediment to this project of society and partnership lies in the avidity and selfishness of their natural temper; to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the stability of possession, and for mutual restraint and forbearance. I am sensible, that this method of proceeding is not altogether natural; but besides that I here only suppose those reflections to be form'd at once, which in fact arise insensibly and by degrees; besides this, I say, 'tis very possible, that several persons, being by different accidents separated from the societies, to which they formerly belong'd, may be oblig'd to form a new society among themselves; in which case they are entirely in the situation above-mention'd.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，一般规则，即<i class="calibre10">占有必须是稳定的</i>，不是由特定的判断来适用的，而是由其他一般规则来适用的，这些规则必须延伸到整个社会，并且因怨恨或恩惠而不灵活。为了说明这一点，我举出以下例子。我首先考虑到人在野蛮和孤独的状态下；并假设他们意识到这种状态的苦难，并预见到社会将带来的好处，他们寻求彼此的陪伴，并提出相互保护和帮助。我还认为，他们具有这样的智慧，能够立即察觉到这个社会和伙伴关系项目的主要障碍在于他们自然脾气的狂热和自私；为了弥补这一点，他们签订了一个协议，以稳定占有，并相互约束和忍耐。我知道，这种行事方式并不完全是自然的；但除此之外，我在这里只是假设那些思考是立即形成的，而事实上这些思考是不经意地和逐步形成的；此外，我说，"几个人由于不同的意外而脱离了他们以前所属的社会，这是很有可能的，他们可能不得不在他们之间形成一个新的社会；在这种情况下，他们完全处于上面提到的情况。</p></div>

This relation, then, is a species of cause and effect; and as property is nothing but a stable possession; deriv'd from the rules of justice, or the conventions of men, 'tis to be consider'd as the same species of relation. But here we may observe, that as the power of using any object becomes more or less certain, according as the interruptions we may meet with are more or less probable; and as this probability may increase by insensible degrees; 'tis in many cases impossible to determine when possession begins or ends; nor is there any certain standard, by which we can decide such controversies. A wild boar, that falls into our snares, is deem'd to be in our possession, if it be impossible for him to escape. But what do we mean by impossible?

		<p class="block_6 en">However useful, or even necessary, the stability of possession may be to human society, 'tis attended with very considerable inconveniences. The relation of fitness or suitableness ought never to enter into consideration, in distributing the properties of mankind; but we must govern ourselves by rules, which are more general in their application, and more free from doubt and uncertainty. Of this kind is present possession upon the first establishment of society; and afterwards occupation, prescription, accession, and succession. As these depend very much on chance, they must frequently prove contradictory both to men's wants and desires; and persons and possessions must often be very ill adjusted. This is a grand inconvenience, which calls for a remedy. To apply one directly, and allow every man to seize by violence what he judges to be fit for him, wou'd destroy society; and therefore the rules of justice seek some medium betwixt a rigid stability, and this changeable and uncertain adjustment. But there is no medium better than that obvious one, that possession and property shou'd always be stable, except when the proprietor consents to bestow them on some other person. This rule can have no ill consequence, in occasioning wars and dissentions; since the proprietor's consent, who alone is concern'd, is taken along in the alienation: And it may serve to many good purposes in adjusting property to persons. Different parts of the earth produce different commodities; and not only so, but different men both are by nature fitted for different employments, and attain to greater perfection in any one, when they confine themselves to it alone. All this requires a mutual exchange and commerce; for which reason the translation of property by consent is founded on a law of nature, as well as its stability without such a consent.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">无论占有的稳定性对人类社会多么有用，甚至是必要，它都有相当多的不便之处。在分配人类财产时，不应考虑合适与否的关系；但我们必须用规则来管理自己，这些规则的适用范围更广，也更没有疑问和不确定性。这类规则是在社会刚建立时的占有；然后是占有、规定、加入和继承。由于这些在很大程度上取决于机会，它们必须经常被证明与人们的愿望和欲望相矛盾；而且人和财产必须经常被调整得非常糟糕。这是一个巨大的不便，需要采取补救措施。如果直接采用一种方法，允许每个人通过暴力夺取他认为适合自己的东西，就会破坏社会；因此，正义的规则在严格的稳定性和这种易变的、不确定的调整之间寻求某种媒介。但没有比这一明显的媒介更好的了，那就是占有和财产应该永远是稳定的，除非所有者同意将其赠予其他人。这条规则在引起战争和争端方面不会有任何不良后果；因为在转让过程中，只有产权人同意，而产权人是唯一关心的人。而且在调整财产与人之间的关系方面，它可以起到许多良好的作用。地球上不同的地方生产不同的商品；不仅如此，不同的人天生就适合于不同的工作，而且当他们只局限于某项工作时，在任何一项工作中都能达到更完美的效果。所有这一切都需要相互交换和商业；为此，通过同意而进行的财产转换是建立在自然法则之上的，也是在没有这种同意的情况下的稳定。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far is determin'd by a plain utility and interest. But perhaps 'tis from more trivial reasons, that delivery, or a sensible transference of the object is commonly requir'd by civil laws, and also by the laws of nature, according to most me if authors, as a requisite circumstance in the translation of property. The property of an object, when taken for something real, without any reference to morality, or the sentiments of the mind, is a quality perfectly insensible, and even inconceivable; nor can we form any distinct notion, either of its stability or translation. This imperfection of our ideas is less sensibly felt with regard to its stability, as it engages less our attention, and is easily past over by the mind, without any scrupulous examination. But as the translation of property from one person to another is a more remarkable event, the defect of our ideas becomes more sensible on that occasion, and obliges us to turn ourselves on every side in search of some remedy. Now as nothing more enlivens any idea than a present impression, and a relation betwixt that impression and the idea; 'tis natural for us to seek some false light from this quarter. In order to aid the imagination in conceiving the transference of property, we take the sensible object, and actually transfer its possession to the person, on whom we wou'd bestow the property. The suppos'd resemblance of the actions, and the presence of this sensible delivery, deceive the mind, and make it fancy, that it conceives the mysterious transition of the property. And that this explication of the matter is just, appears hence, that men have invented a symbolical delivery, to satisfy the fancy, where the real one is impracticable. Thus the giving the keys of a granary is understood to be the delivery of the corn contain'd in it: The giving of stone and earth represents the delivery of a mannor. This is a kind of superstitious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature, resembling the Roman catholic superstitions in religion. As the Roman catholics represent the inconceivable mysteries of the Christian religion, and render them more present to the mind, by a taper, or habit, or grimace, which is suppos'd to resemble them; so lawyers and moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason, and have endeavour'd by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the transference of property by consent.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">到目前为止，这是由一个简单的效用和利益决定的。但是，也许是出于更微不足道的原因，民法和自然法通常都要求交付，或者物体的明显转移，根据我的大多数作者，作为财产转移的一个必要条件。当一个物体的属性被视为真实的东西时，如果不涉及道德或心灵的情感，它是一种完全不可感知的品质，甚至是不可想象的；我们也无法形成任何明确的概念，无论是其稳定性还是转换。在稳定性方面，我们的观念的这种不完善性感觉不明显，因为它较少引起我们的注意，而且很容易被头脑所忽略，不需要任何严格的检查。但是，由于财产从一个人手中转移到另一个人手中是一个更显著的事件，我们的观念的缺陷在这种情况下变得更加明显，并迫使我们从各方面寻找一些补救措施。现在，没有什么比现在的印象以及这种印象和观念之间的关系更能使任何观念活跃起来了；我们自然会从这个方面寻求一些错误的启示。为了帮助想象力想象财产的转移，我们把可感知的物体，实际地把它的所有权转移给我们想赋予其财产的人。行动的假定相似性和这个可感物的存在，欺骗了头脑，并使它幻想出财产的神秘转移。这种解释是公正的，因此，人们发明了一种象征性的交付方式，以满足人们的幻想，而真正的交付方式是不可行的。因此，给粮仓钥匙被理解为是对粮仓中玉米的交付。给予石头和泥土代表了庄园的交付。这是民法和自然法中的一种迷信做法，类似于罗马天主教徒在宗教方面的迷信。就像罗马天主教徒通过一种被认为与之相似的锥子、习惯或脸部表情来表现基督教中不可想象的奥秘，并使之在人们的脑海中更加清晰；因此，律师和道德家们出于同样的原因，也遇到了类似的发明，并努力通过这些手段来满足他们对财产转让的同意。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I say, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, that a promise is not intelligible naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with society, could never enter into any engagements with another, even tho' they could perceive each other's thoughts by intuition. If promises be natural and intelligible, there must be some act of the mind attending these words, <i class="calibre10">I promise</i>; and on this act of the mind must the obligation depend. Let us, therefore, run over all the facilities of the soul, and see which of them is exerted in our promises.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我说，<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，承诺不是自然可以理解的，也不是人类惯例的先例；一个不熟悉社会的人，永远不可能与另一个人达成任何约定，即使他们可以通过直觉察觉对方的想法。如果承诺是自然的和可理解的，那么在这些话中一定有一些思想行为，即<i class="calibre10">我承诺</i>；而义务一定取决于这种思想行为。因此，让我们回顾一下灵魂的所有设施，看看它们中的哪一个在我们的许诺中得到了发挥。</p></div>

Neither is it the <i class="calibre10">willing</i> of that action, which we promise to perform: For a promise always regards some future time, and the will has an influence only on present actions. It follows, therefore, that since the act of the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces its obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any particular performance, it must necessarily be the <i class="calibre10">willing</i> of that <i class="calibre10">obligation</i>, which arises from the promise. Nor is this only a conclusion of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves, when we say that we are bound by our own consent, and that the obligation arises from our mere will and pleasure. The only question, then, is, whether there be not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind, and such an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into, whose ideas are not confounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of language.</p>

A change of the obligation supposes a change of the sentiment; and a creation of a new obligation supposes some new sentiment to arise. But 'tis certain we can naturally no more change our own sentiments, than the motions of the heavens; nor by a single act of our will, that is, by a promise, render any action agreeable or disagreeable, moral or immoral; which, without that act, wou'd have produc'd contrary impressions, or have been endow'd with different qualities. It wou'd be absurd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new sentiment of pain or pleasure; nor is it possible, that men cou'd naturally fall into so gross an absurdity. A promise, therefore, is <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> something altogether unintelligible, nor is there any act of the mind belonging to it.<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-320" id="calibre_link-199" title="72">72</a></sup> </p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The same truth may be prov'd still more evidently by that reasoning, which prov'd justice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action can be requir'd of us as our duty, unless there be implanted in human nature some actuating passion or motive, capable of producing the action. This motive cannot be the sense of duty. A sense of duty supposes an antecedent obligation: And where an action is not requir'd by any natural passion, it cannot be requir'd by any natural obligation; since it may be omitted without proving any defect or imperfection in the mind and temper, and consequently without any vice. Now 'tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises had no moral obligation, we never shou'd feel any inclination to observe them. This is not the case with the natural virtues. Tho' there was no obligation to relieve the miserable, our humanity wou'd lead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the omission arises from its being a proof, that we want the natural sentiments of humanity.

		<p class="block_6 cn">同样的真理可以通过那个推理更明显地证明，该推理证明一般来说，正义是一种人为的美德。除非在人的本性中植入一些能够产生行动的激情或动机，否则任何行动都不能作为我们的责任而被要求。这种动机不可能是责任感。义务感假定有一个先验的义务。如果一个行为不是由任何自然的激情所要求的，它就不可能是由任何自然的义务所要求的；因为它可以被省略，而不证明心灵和脾气中有任何缺陷或不完善，因此也就没有任何罪恶。现在很明显，我们没有任何动机来引导我们履行承诺，与责任感不同。如果我们认为承诺没有道德上的义务，我们就不会有遵守承诺的倾向。自然美德的情况并非如此。尽管没有义务去救济那些可怜的人，但我们的人性会引导我们去做；而当我们不履行这一义务时，不履行义务的不道德性就会产生，因为这证明我们缺乏人性的自然情感。一个父亲知道照顾他的孩子是他的责任。但他</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to discover these necessities and interests, we must consider the same qualities of human nature, which we have already found to give rise to the preceding laws of society. Men being naturally selfish, or endow'd only with a confin'd generosity, they are not easily induc'd to perform any action for the interest of strangers, except with a view to some reciprocal advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by such a performance. Now as it frequently happens, that these mutual performances cannot be finish'd at the same instant, 'tis necessary, that one party be contented to remain in uncertainty, and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a return of kindness. But so much corruption is there among men, that, generally speaking, this becomes but a slender security; and as the benefactor is here suppos'd to bestow his favours with a view to self interest, this both takes off from the obligation, and sets an example of selfishness, which is the true mother of ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural course of our passions and inclinations, we shou'd perform but few actions for the advantage of others, from disinterested views; because we are naturally very limited in our kindness and affection: And we shou'd perform as few of that kind, out of a regard to interest; because we cannot depend upon their gratitude. Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a manner lost among mankind, and every one reduc'd to his own skill and industry for his well-being and subsistence. The invention of the law of nature, concerning the <i class="calibre10">stability</i> of possession, has already render'd men tolerable to each other; that of the <i class="calibre10">transference</i> of property and possession by consent has begun to render them mutually advantageous: But still these laws of nature, however strictly observ'd, are not sufficient to render them so serviceable to each other, as by nature they are fitted to become. Tho' possession be stable, men may often reap but small advantage from it, while they are possess'd of a greater quantity of any species of goods than they have occasion for, and at the same time suffer by the want of others. The <i class="calibre10">transference</i> of property, which is the proper remedy for this inconvenience, cannot remedy it entirely; because it can only take place with regard to such objects as are <i class="calibre10">present</i> and <i class="calibre10">individual</i>, but not to such as are <i class="calibre10">absent</i> or <i class="calibre10">general</i>. One cannot transfer the property of a particular house, twenty leagues distant; because the consent cannot be attended with delivery, which is a requisite circumstance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten bushels of corn, or five hogsheads of wine, by the mere expression and consent; because these are only general terms, and have no direct relation to any particular heap of corn, or barrels of wine. Besides, the commerce of mankind is not confin'd to the barter of commodities, but may extend to services and actions, which we may exchange to our mutual interest and advantage. Your corn is ripe today; mine will be so to-morrow. 'Tis profitable for us both, that I shou'd labour with you to-day, and that you shou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a return, I know I shou'd be disappointed, and that I shou'd in vain depend upon you gratitude. Here then I leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了发现这些必要性和利益，我们必须考虑人性中的相同品质，我们已经发现这些品质产生了前面的社会规律。人天生是自私的，或者只被赋予了有限的慷慨，他们不容易被诱导为陌生人的利益采取任何行动，除非是为了某种互惠的利益，而他们除了这样的行为之外没有希望获得这种利益。现在经常发生的情况是，这些相互的行为不能在同一时刻完成，因此有必要让一方满足于保持不确定性，并依靠另一方的感激来回报恩情。但人与人之间的腐败如此之多，以至于一般来说，这只是一种微不足道的保障；而且，由于施恩者在这里被认为是为了自己的利益而施恩，这既免除了义务，又树立了一个自私的榜样，而这正是忘恩负义的真正根源。因此，如果我们遵循我们的激情和倾向的自然进程，我们应该从无私的观点出发，为他人的利益做出很少的行动；因为我们的仁慈和爱意自然是非常有限的。而我们出于对利益的考虑，也应该尽量少做这种事，因为我们不能依靠他们的感激。这样一来，人类之间就失去了互相斡旋的机会，每个人都只能靠自己的技能和努力来维持自己的幸福和生计。关于占有的<i class="calibre10">稳定性</i>的自然法则的发明，已经使人们相互容忍；通过同意<i class="calibre10">转让</i>财产和占有的法则已经开始使他们相互有利。但是，这些自然法则，无论如何严格遵守，都不足以使他们相互之间有如此大的好处，就像他们天生就应该成为的那样。尽管占有是稳定的，但人们往往只能从中获得很小的好处，而他们所拥有的任何种类的商品的数量都超过了他们的需要，同时又因其他人的匮乏而受到影响。财产<i class="calibre10">转让</i>是对这种不便的适当补救措施，但不能完全补救；因为它只能对<i class="calibre10">现有的</i>和<i class="calibre10">个别的</i>物品进行转让，而不能对<i class="calibre10">不存在的</i>或<i class="calibre10">一般的</i>物品进行转让。一个人不能转让20里格以外的某个房子的财产；因为这种同意不能伴随着交付，而交付是一个必要的情况。人们也不能仅仅通过表达和同意来转让十蒲式耳的玉米或五桶酒的财产；因为这些只是一般条款，与任何特定的一堆玉米或一桶酒没有直接关系。此外，人类的商业并不局限于商品的交换，而是可以延伸到服务和行动，我们可以交换这些服务和行动以实现我们的共同利益和好处。你的玉米今天已经成熟了，我的玉米明天也会成熟。今天我和你一起劳动，明天你帮助我，这对我们双方都是有利的。我对你没有什么好感，也知道你对我也没有什么好感。因此，我不会为你付出任何努力；如果我以自己的名义与你一起劳动，期望得到回报，我知道我将会失望，我将会徒劳地依赖你的感激。那我就在这里让你独自劳动吧。你也以同样的方式对待我。季节变了，我们都因为缺乏相互信任和安全而失去了收获。</p></div>

And indeed, did the success of their designs depend upon their success in correcting the selfishness and ingratitude of men, they wou'd never make any progress, unless aided by omnipotence, which is alone able to new-mould the human mind, and change its character in such fundamental articles. All they can pretend to, is, to give a new direction to those natural passions, and teach us that we can better satisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I learn to do a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness; because I forsee, that he will return my service, in expectation of another of the same kind, and in order to maintain the same correspondence of good offices with me or with others.

There needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us perceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest experience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each individual perceives the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he immediately performs his part of any contract, as being assur'd, that they will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter into a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to be true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this concert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in the faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to other members of the society.

		<p class="block_6 en">To confirm this, we may subjoin some other reflections concerning that will, which is suppos'd to enter into a promise, and to cause its obligation. 'Tis evident, that the will alone is never suppos'd to cause the obligation, but must be express'd by words or signs, in order to impose a tye upon any man. The expression being once brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, tho' he secretly give a different direction to his intention, and with-hold himself both from a resolution, and from willing an obligation. But tho' the expression makes on most occasions the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one, who shou'd make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any intention of binding himself wou'd not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he knows its meaning, yet if he uses it in jest only, and with such signs as shew evidently he has no serious intention of binding himself, he wou'd not lie under any obligation of performance; but 'tis necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases. where the signs are of a different kind from those of deceit.

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证实这一点，我们可以附上一些关于意愿的其他思考，它被认为是进入承诺并导致其义务。显而易见的是，从来没有人认为只有意志才会导致义务，而是必须通过语言或符号来表达，才能将承诺强加给任何人。表达一旦作为意愿的附属品出现，很快就会成为承诺的主要部分；一个人也不会不受他的话约束，尽管他暗中给自己的意图提供了不同的方向，并使自己既没有决心，也没有愿意承担义务。尽管在大多数情况下，表达方式是承诺的全部内容，但它并不总是如此；一个人如果使用他不知道其含义的任何表达方式，而且他在使用时没有任何约束自己的意图，那么他肯定不会受其约束。不，尽管他知道它的意思，但如果他只是开玩笑地使用它，而且有明显的迹象表明他没有认真地打算约束自己，他就不会有任何履行义务；但是，这些话必须是意志的完美表达，没有任何相反的迹象。不，即使是这样，我们也不能过分地想象，一个人，如果我们凭着敏捷的理解力，从某些迹象中推测出他有欺骗我们的意图，那么，如果我们接受他的表达或口头承诺，他就不会受到约束；但必须把这个结论限制在那些迹象与欺骗不同的情况下。如果承诺的义务仅仅是人类为方便社会而发明的，那么所有这些矛盾都很容易解释；但如果它是<i class="calibre10">真实</i>和<i class="calibre10">自然的</i>东西，由心智或身体的任何行动产生，则永远无法解释。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I shall farther observe, 'that since every new promise imposes a new obligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new obligation arises from his will; 'tis one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagin'd, and may even be compar'd to <i class="calibre10">transubstantiation</i>, or <i class="calibre10">holy orders<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-267" title="73">73</a></sup></i>, where a certain form of words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even of a human creature. But tho' these mysteries be so far alike, 'tis very remarkable, that they differ widely in other particulars, and that this difference may be regarded as a strong proof of the difference of their origins. As the obligation of promises is an invention for the interest of society, 'tis warp'd into as many different forms as that interest requires, and even runs into direct contradictions, rather than lose sight of its object. But as those other monstrous doctrines are merely priestly inventions, and have no public interest in view, they are less disturb'd in their progress by new obstacles; and it must be own'd, that, after the first absurdity, they follow more directly the current of reason and good sense. Theologians clearly perceiv'd, that the external form of words, being mere sound, require an intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this intention being once consider'd as a requisite circumstance, its absence must equally prevent the effect, whether avow'd or conceal'd, whether sincere or deceitful. Accordingly they have commonly determin'd, that the intention of the priest makes the sacrament, and that when he secretly withdraws his intention, he is highly criminal in himself; but still destroys the baptism, or communion, or holy orders. The terrible consequences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place; as the inconvenience of a similar doctrine, with regard to promises, have prevented that doctrine from establishing itse1f. Men are always more concern'd about the present life than the future; and are apt to think the smallest evil, which regards the former, more important than the greatest, which regards the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将进一步指出，"由于每一个新的承诺都会给承诺者带来新的道德义务，而且这种新的义务来自于他的意愿；这是可能被想象到的最神秘和最难以理解的操作之一，甚至可以与<i class="calibre10">超度</i>或<i class="calibre10">神圣的命令</i> <i class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-267" title="73">相提并论</a></sup></i> <i class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-267" title="73"></a></sup></i>，在那里，某种形式的语言，加上某种意图，完全改变了外部物体的性质，甚至是人类的生物。但是，尽管这些奥秘如此相似，非常值得注意的是，它们在其他方面有很大的不同，而且这种不同可以被看作是它们起源不同的有力证明。由于承诺的义务是为了社会的利益而发明的，它被扭曲成这种利益所需要的各种不同的形式，甚至会遇到直接的矛盾，而不是忽视其目标。但是，由于其他那些畸形的学说只是牧师的发明，并没有考虑到公众的利益，所以它们在发展过程中受到的新障碍干扰较少；而且必须承认，在最初的荒谬之后，它们更直接地遵循了理性和理智的潮流。神学家们清楚地认识到，话语的外部形式只是声音，需要有一个意图才能使其产生任何效力；而这种意图一旦被认为是一个必要的情况，它的缺失同样会阻止效果的产生，无论是公开的还是隐瞒的，无论是真诚的还是欺骗的。因此，他们通常认定，牧师的意图造就了圣事，而当他秘密地撤回他的意图时，他本身就是严重的犯罪；但仍然破坏了洗礼、圣餐或圣职。这个教义的可怕后果并不能阻止它的发生；就像类似的教义在承诺方面的不便，也阻止了该教义的建立。人总是对现在的生活比对未来的生活更关心；而且很容易认为涉及前者的最小邪恶比涉及后者的最大邪恶更重要。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">We may draw the same conclusion, concerning the origin of promises, from the <i class="calibre10">force</i>, which is suppos'd to invalidate all contracts, and to free us from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promises have no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the convenience and advantage of society. If we consider aright of the matter, force is not essentially different from any other motive of hope or fear, which may induce us to engage our word, and lay ourselves under any obligation. A man, dangerously wounded, who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him, wou'd certainly be bound to performance; tho' the case be not so much different from that of one, who promises a sum to a robber, as to produce so great a difference in our sentiments of morality, if these sentiments were not built entirely on public interest and convenience.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">关于承诺的起源，我们可以得出同样的结论，因为人们认为这种<i class="calibre10">力量</i>会使所有的合同无效，并使我们摆脱其义务。这样的原则证明，承诺没有自然的义务，只是为了社会的便利和利益而人为设计的。如果我们正确地考虑这个问题，武力与任何其他希望或恐惧的动机没有本质上的区别，后者可能会诱使我们承诺我们的话，并使我们承担任何义务。一个受了重伤的人，如果答应给外科医生一笔钱来治疗他，那么他肯定会履行义务；尽管这种情况与一个答应给强盗一笔钱的人没有太大的区别，以至于在我们的道德情感上产生如此大的差异，如果这些情感不是完全建立在公共利益和便利之上的话。</p></div>

'Tis on the strict observance of those three laws, that the peace and security of human society entirely depend; nor is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among men, where these are neglected. Society is absolutely necessary for the well-being of men; and these are as necessary to the support of society. Whatever restraint they may impose on the passions of men, they are the real offspring of those passions, and are only a more artful and more refin'd way of satisfying them. Nothing is more vigilant and inventive than our passions; and nothing is more obvious, than the convention for the observance of these rules. Nature has, therefore, trusted this affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not plac'd in the mind any peculiar original principles, to determine us to a set of actions, into which the other principles of our frame and constitution were sufficient to lead us. And to convince us the more fully of this truth, we may here stop a moment, and from a review of the preceding reasoning's may draw some new arguments, to prove that those laws, however necessary, are entirely artificial, and of human invention; and consequently that justice is an artificial, and not a natural virtue.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I. The first argument I shall make use of is deriv'd from the vulgar definition of justice. <i class="calibre10">Justice is commonly defin'd</i> to be <i class="calibre10">a constant and perpetual will of giving every one his due</i>. In this definition 'tis supposed, that there are such things as right and property, independent of justice, and antecedent to it; and that they wou'd have subsisted, tho' men had never dreamt of practising such a virtue. I have already observ'd, in a cursory manner, the fallacy of this opinion, and shall here continue to open up a little more distinctly my sentiments on that subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">I.我将使用的第一个论据来自于正义的粗俗定义。<i class="calibre10">公正通常被定义</i>为<i class="calibre10">给予每个人应有的恒定和永久的意愿</i>。在这个定义中，人们认为存在着权利和财产这样的东西，它们是独立于正义的，是正义的前身；而且，即使人们从未梦想过要实行这样的美德，它们也会存在的。我已经粗略地指出了这种观点的谬误，并将在这里继续更明确地阐述我对这个问题的看法。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall begin with observing, that this quality, which we call <i class="calibre10">property</i>, is like many of the imaginary qualities of the <i class="calibre10">peripatetic</i> philosophy, and vanishes upon a more accurate inspection into the subject, when consider'd a-part from our moral sentiments. 'Tis evident property does not consist in any of the sensible qualities of the object. For these may continue invariably the same, while the property changes. Property, therefore, must consist in some relation of the object. But 'tis not in its relation with regard to other external and inanimate objects. For these may also continue invariably the same, while the property changes. This quality, therefore, consists in the relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But 'tis not the external and corporeal relation, which forms the essence of property. For that relation may be the same betwixt inanimate objects, or with regard to brute creatures; tho' in those cases it forms no property. 'Tis, therefore, in some internal relation, that the property consists; that is, in some influence, which the external relations of the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation, which we call <i class="calibre10">occupation</i> or first possession, is not of itself imagin'd to be the property of the object, but only to cause its property. Now 'tis evident, this external relation causes nothing in external objects, and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a sense of duty in abstaining from that object, and in restoring it to the first possessor. These actions are properly what we call <i class="calibre10">justice</i>; and consequently 'tis on that virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue on the property.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我首先要指出的是，这种我们称之为<i class="calibre10">财产</i>的品质，与<i class="calibre10">围观</i>哲学的许多想象中的品质一样，当从我们的道德情感出发，对这个问题进行更准确的检查时，就会消失。很明显，财产并不包含在物体的任何可感知的品质中。因为这些品质可能始终如一，而属性却在变化。因此，属性必须包含在物体的某种关系中。但这并不在于它与其他外部和无生命物体的关系。因为这些关系也可能保持不变，而属性却在变化。因此，这种性质包括物体与智能和理性人的关系。但这并不是构成财产本质的外部和肉体的关系。因为这种关系在无生命的物体之间，或在与畜生的关系方面可能是相同的；尽管在这些情况下，它不构成财产。因此，财产是由某种内部关系构成的；也就是说，是由对象的外部关系对思想和行为的某种影响构成的。因此，我们称之为 "<i class="calibre10">占有</i>"或 "第一占有 "的外部关系，其本身并不被想象为物体的属性，而只是导致其属性。现在很明显，这种外部关系在外部物体中没有引起任何东西，而只是对心灵产生影响，使我们在放弃该物体时有一种责任感，并将其归还给第一占有者。这些行为就是我们所说的<i class="calibre10">正义</i>；因此，财产的性质取决于这种美德，而不是财产上的美德。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If any one, therefore, wou'd assert, that justice is a natural virtue, and injustice a natural vice, he must assert, that abstracting from the notions of <i class="calibre10">property</i>, and <i class="calibre10">right</i> and <i class="calibre10">obligation</i>, a certain conduct and train of actions, in certain external relations of objects, has naturally a moral beauty or deformity, and causes an original pleasure or uneasiness. Thus the restoring a man's goods to him is consider'd as virtuous, not because nature has annex'd a certain sentiment of pleasure to such a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but because she has annex'd that sentiment to such a conduct, with regard to those external objects, of which others have had the first or long possession, or which they have receiv'd by the consent of those, who have had first or long possession. If nature has given us no such sentiment, there is not, naturally, nor antecedent to human conventions, any such thing as property. Now, tho' it seems sufficiently evident, in this dry and accurate consideration of the present subject, that nature has annex'd no pleasure or sentiment of approbation to such a conduct; yet that I may leave as little room for doubt as possible, I shall subjoin a few more arguments to confirm my opinion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，如果有人要断言，正义是一种自然的美德，而不正义是一种自然的恶习，他必须断言，从<i class="calibre10">财产</i>、<i class="calibre10">权利</i>和<i class="calibre10">义务</i>的概念中抽象出来，在对象的某些外部关系中，某种行为和一系列行动自然具有道德上的美感或畸形，并引起一种原始的快乐或不安。因此，把一个人的东西还给他被认为是美德，并不是因为自然界把某种快乐的情绪附在这种行为上，对别人的财产，而是因为她把这种情绪附在这种行为上，对那些别人首先或长期拥有的外部物体，或他们经首先或长期拥有的人同意而得到的东西。如果自然界没有赋予我们这样的情感，那么自然也就不存在财产这样的东西，也不存在人类惯例的前身。现在，尽管在对本主题进行的这种干脆而准确的考虑中，自然界对这种行为没有赋予任何快乐或赞许的情感，这一点似乎很明显；但为了尽可能不给人留下怀疑的余地，我将再附上一些论据来证实我的观点。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">First</i>, If nature had given us a pleasure of this kind, it wou'd have been as evident and discernible as on every other occasion; nor shou'd we have found any difficulty to perceive, that the consideration of such actions, in such a situation, gives a certain pleasure and sentiment of approbation. We shou'd not have been oblig'd to have recourse to notions of property in the definition of justice, and at the same time make use of the notions of justice in the definition of property. This deceitful method of reasoning is a plain proof, that there are contain'd in the subject some obscurities and difficulties, which we are not able to surmount, and which we desire to evade by this artifice.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">首先</i>，如果自然界给了我们这种快乐，它就会像在其他任何场合一样明显和清晰；我们也不应该发现任何困难，即在这种情况下，对这种行为的考虑会带来某种快乐和赞许的情绪。我们不应该被迫在定义正义的时候求助于财产的概念，同时又在定义财产的时候利用正义的概念。这种欺骗性的推理方法是一个明显的证据，说明在这个问题上存在着一些我们无法逾越的模糊和困难，而我们希望通过这种诡计来逃避这些困难。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, Those rules, by which properties, rights, and obligations are determin'd, have in them no marks of a natural origin, but many of artifice and contrivance. They are too numerous to have proceeded from nature: They are changeable by human laws: And have all of them a direct and evident tendency to public good, and the support of civil society. This last circumstance is remarkable upon two accounts. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, because, tho' the cause of the establishment of these laws had been a <i class="calibre10">regard</i> for the public good, as much as the public good is their natural tendency, they wou'd still have been artificial, as being purposely contriv'd and directed to a certain end. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, because, if men had been endow'd with such a strong regard for public good, they wou'd never have restrain'd themselves by these rules; so that the laws of justice arise from natural principles in a manner still more oblique and artificial. 'Tis self-love which is their real origin; and as the self-love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these several interested passions are oblig'd to adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and behaviour. This system, therefore, comprehending the interest of each individual, is of course advantageous to the public; tho' it be not intended for that purpose by the inventors.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">第二</i>，那些确定财产、权利和义务的规则，没有自然起源的痕迹，而是有许多人为和设计的痕迹。它们太多，不可能来自自然。它们是可以通过人类的法律来改变的。它们都有一个直接和明显的倾向，即对公共利益和公民社会的支持。这最后一个情况有两个方面值得注意。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，因为尽管建立这些法律的原因是出于对公共利益的<i class="calibre10">考虑</i>，就像公共利益是它们的自然倾向一样，但它们仍然是人为的，因为它们是有目的地设计和指导某个目标的。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，因为如果人们对公共利益有如此强烈的关注，他们就不会用这些规则来约束自己；因此，正义的法则从自然原则中产生，其方式更加斜率和人为。自爱才是它们的真正来源；由于一个人的自爱自然与另一个人的自爱相反，这几种相关的激情不得不以这样一种方式来调整自己，以便在某种行为和举止体系中达成一致。因此，这个系统包含了每个人的利益，当然对公众是有利的；尽管发明者并不打算为此目的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">II. In the second place we may observe, that all kinds of vice and virtue run insensibly into each other, and may approach by such imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and from this observation we may derive a new argument for the foregoing principle. For whatever may be the case, with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue, 'tis certain, that rights, and obligations, and property, admit of no such insensible gradation, but that a man either has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely oblig'd to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obligation. However civil laws may talk of a perfect <i class="calibre10">dominion</i>, and of an imperfect, 'tis easy to observe, that this arises from a fiction, which has no foundation in reason, and can never enter into our notions of natural justice and equity. A man that hires a horse, tho' but for a day, has as full a right to make use of it for that time, as he whom we call its proprietor has to make use of it any other day; and 'tis evident, that however the use may be bounded in time or degree, the right itself is not susceptible of any such gradation, but is absolute and entire, so far as it extends Accordingly we may observe, that this right both arises and perishes in an instant; and that a man entirely acquires the property of any object by occupation, or the consent of the proprietor; and loses it by his own consent; without any of that insensible gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations. Since, therefore, this is the case with regard to property, and right, and obligations, I ask, how it stands with regard to justice and injustice? After whatever manner you answer this question, you run into inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that justice and injustice admit of degree, and run insensibly into each other, you expressly contradict the foregoing position, that obligation and property are not susceptible of such a gradation. These depend entirely upon justice and injustice, and follow them in all their variations. Where the justice is entire, the property is also entire: Where the justice is imperfect, the property must also be imperfect; And <i class="calibre10">vice versa</i>, if the property admit of no such variations, they must also be incompatible with justice. If you assent, therefore, to this last proposition, and assert, that justice and injustice are not susceptible of degrees, you in effect assert, that they are not <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> either vicious or virtuous; since vice and virtue, moral good and evil, and indeed all <i class="calibre10">natural</i> qualities, run insensibly into each other, and are, on many occasions, undistinguishable.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">二、其次，我们可以看到，各种恶习和美德都不约而同地相互影响，并可能以难以察觉的程度接近，从而使人很难，甚至绝对不可能确定什么时候会发生。其次，我们可以观察到，所有种类的恶习和美德都不约而同地相互影响，并可能以难以察觉的程度接近，以至于很难，甚至绝对不可能确定一个结束，另一个开始；从这个观察中，我们可以为上述原则得出一个新的论据。因为无论情况如何，关于各种恶习和美德，可以肯定的是，权利、义务和财产不允许有这种不可察觉的等级，但一个人要么有充分和完美的财产，要么根本没有；要么完全有义务执行任何行动，要么不承担任何形式的义务。无论民法如何谈论完美的<i class="calibre10">统治权</i>和不完美的统治权，我们都不难发现，这源于一种虚构，它在理性中没有任何基础，也永远无法进入我们的自然正义和公平的概念中。一个人租了一匹马，虽然只租了一天，但他在这段时间内有充分的权利使用它，就像我们称之为马主的人在其他任何一天都有权利使用它一样；很明显，不管使用的时间或程度如何，权利本身是不可能有任何这种分级的，而是绝对和完整的，只要它延伸了。一个人完全是通过占领或业主的同意而获得任何物品的财产；并通过他自己的同意而失去它；没有任何不可知的分级，而这种分级在其他品质和关系中是很明显的。因此，既然在财产、权利和义务方面是这样，我问，在正义和不正义方面是怎样的？无论你以何种方式回答这个问题，你都会遇到难以解决的困难。如果你回答说，正义和非正义是有程度之分的，并且不约而同地相互影响，那么你就明确地违背了前面的立场，即义务和财产是不可能有这种等级的。这些完全取决于正义和非正义，并在其所有的变化中跟随它们。当正义是完整的，财产也是完整的。<i class="calibre10">反之亦然</i>，如果财产不允许有这样的变化，它们也必须与正义不相容。因此，如果你同意这最后一个命题，并断言正义和非正义不可能有程度之分，那么你实际上就断言，它们<i class="calibre10">自然</i>不是恶性或良性的；因为罪恶和美德，道德上的善和恶，以及实际上所有的<i class="calibre10">自然</i>品质，都不可能相互影响，而且在许多情况下，是无法区分的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">And here it may be worth while to observe, that tho' abstract reasoning, and the general maxims of philosophy and law establish this position, <i class="calibre10">that property, and right, and obligation admit not of degrees</i>, yet in our common and negligent way of thinking, we find great difficulty to entertain that opinion, and do even <i class="calibre10">secretly</i> embrace the contrary principle. An object must either be in the possession of one person or another. An action must either be perform'd or not. The necessity there is of choosing one side in these dilemmas, and the impossibility there often is of finding any just medium, oblige us, when we reflect on the matter, to acknowledge, that all property and obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we consider the origin of property and obligation, and find that they depend on public utility, and sometimes on the propensities of the imagination, which are seldom entire on any side; we are naturally inclin'd to imagine, that these moral relations admit of an insensible gradation. Hence it is, that in references, where the consent of the parties leave the referees entire masters of the subject, they commonly discover so much equity and justice on both sides, as induces them to strike a medium, and divide the difference betwixt the parties. Civil judges, who have not this liberty, but are oblig'd to give a decisive sentence on some one side, are often at a loss how to determine, and are necessitated to proceed on the most frivolous reasons in the world. Half rights and obligations, which seem so natural in common life, are perfect absurdities in their tribunal; for which reason they are often oblig'd to take half arguments for whole ones, in order to terminate the affair one way or other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这里，也许值得注意的是，尽管抽象的推理和哲学与法律的一般格言确立了这一立场，<i class="calibre10">即财产、权利和义务不允许有程度之分</i>，但在我们普通和疏忽的思维方式中，我们发现很难接受这一观点，甚至<i class="calibre10">秘密地</i>接受了相反的原则。一个物体必须是由一个人或另一个人拥有的。一个行动要么被执行，要么不被执行。在这些难题中必须选择一方，而且往往不可能找到任何公正的媒介，因此当我们思考这个问题时，有义务承认，所有的财产和义务都是完整的。但另一方面，当我们考虑到财产和义务的起源时，发现它们取决于公共事业，有时取决于想象力的倾向，而想象力在任何方面都很少是完整的；我们自然会倾向于想象，这些道德关系允许有一个不可察觉的等级。因此，在参考资料中，如果当事人同意让裁判员完全主宰这个问题，他们通常会发现双方都很公平和公正，从而促使他们找到一个媒介，将双方之间的分歧分开。民事法官没有这种自由，而必须对某一方作出决定性的判决，他们往往不知如何决定，不得不以世界上最轻率的理由进行裁决。一半的权利和义务，在普通生活中似乎很自然，但在他们的法庭上却是完全荒谬的；因此，他们常常不得不用一半的论据来代替全部的论据，以便以这种或那种方式结束事件。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">III. The third argument of this kind I shall make use of may be explain'd thus. If we consider the ordinary course of human actions, we shall find, that the mind restrains not itself by any general and universal rules; but acts on most occasions as it is determin'd by its present motives and inclination. As each action is a particular individual event, it must proceed from particular principles, and from our immediate situation within ourselves, and with respect to the rest of the universe. If on some occasions we extend our motives beyond those very circumstances, which gave rise to them, and form something like <i class="calibre10">general rules</i> for our conduct, tis easy to observe, that these rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since, therefore, this is the ordinary course of human actions, we may conclude, that the laws of justice, being universal and perfectly inflexible, can never be deriv'd from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination. No action can be either morally good or evil, unless there be some natural passion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and tis evident, that the morality must be susceptible of all the same variations, which are natural to the passion. Here are two persons, who dispute for an estate; of whom one is rich, a fool, and a bachelor; the other poor, a man of sense, and has a numerous family: The first is my enemy; the second my friend. Whether I be actuated in this affair by a view to public or private interest, by friendship or enmity, I must be induc'd to do my utmost to procure the estate to the latter. Nor wou'd any consideration of the right and property of the persons be able to restrain me, were I actuated only by natural motives, without any combination or convention with others. For as all property depends on morality; and as all morality depends on the ordinary course of our passions and actions; and as these again are only directed by particular motives; 'tis evident, such a partial conduct must be suitable to the strictest morality, and cou'd never be a violation of property. Were men, therefore, to take the liberty of acting with regard to the laws of society, as they do in every other affair, they wou'd conduct themselves, on most occasions, by particular judgments, and wou'd take into consideration the characters and circumstances of the persons, as well as the general nature of the question. But 'tis easy to observe, that this wou'd produce an infinite confusion in human society, and that the avidity and partiality of men wou'd quickly bring disorder into the world, if not restrain'd by some general and inflexible principles. 'Twas, therefore, with a view to this inconvenience, that men have establish'd those principles, and have agreed to restrain themselves by general rules, which are unchangeable by spite and favour, and by particular views of private or public interest. These rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain purpose, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature, which accommodate themselves to circumstances, and have no stated invariable method of operation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">III.我将使用的第三个论据是这样解释的。如果我们考虑一下人类行动的普通过程，我们会发现，心灵并不受任何一般和普遍规则的约束；而是在大多数情况下按照它目前的动机和倾向决定的方式行事。由于每个行动都是一个特殊的个体事件，它必须从特殊的原则出发，从我们自身的直接情况出发，以及相对于宇宙的其他部分而言。如果在某些情况下，我们把我们的动机延伸到引起这些动机的环境之外，并为我们的行为形成类似于<i class="calibre10">一般规则的</i>东西，那么很容易发现，这些规则并不是完全僵硬的，而是允许有许多例外。因此，既然这是人类行为的正常过程，我们可以得出结论，正义的法则是普遍的和完全不灵活的，不可能来自自然，也不可能是任何自然动机或倾向的直接产物。除非有某种自然的激情或动机促使我们去做或阻止我们去做，否则任何行为在道德上都不可能是善的或恶的；很明显，道德必须有所有同样的变化，这些变化是激情的自然表现。这里有两个人在争夺财产；其中一个很有钱，是个傻瓜，还是个单身汉；另一个很穷，是个有理智的人，有很多家庭。前者是我的敌人，后者是我的朋友。无论我在这件事上是出于公共利益还是私人利益，是出于友谊还是敌意，我都必须尽最大努力为后者争取到财产。如果我只是出于自然的动机，而不与他人结合或约定，那么任何对人的权利和财产的考虑也不能约束我。因为所有的财产都取决于道德；而所有的道德都取决于我们的激情和行动的正常过程；而这些又只是由特定的动机所引导；很明显，这样的部分行为必须适合最严格的道德，而且永远不会是对财产的违反。因此，如果人们能够像在其他事务中一样，自由地对社会法律采取行动，他们就会在大多数情况下根据特定的判断来行事，并考虑到人的性格和情况，以及问题的一般性质。但很容易观察到，这将在人类社会中产生无限的混乱，如果没有一些普遍和灵活的原则来约束，人们的狂热和偏执将很快给世界带来混乱。因此，考虑到这种不便，人们制定了这些原则，并同意用一般的规则来约束自己，这些规则不会因为怨恨和宠爱，以及私人或公共利益的特殊观点而改变。那么，这些规则是为了某种目的而人为发明的，与人性的普通原则相悖，这些原则适应环境，没有规定不变的操作方法。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Nor do I perceive how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. I see evidently, that when any man imposes on himself general inflexible rules in his conduct with others, he considers certain objects as their property, which he supposes to be sacred and inviolable. But no proposition can be more evident, than that property is perfectly unintelligible without first supposing justice and injustice; and that these virtues and vices are as unintelligible, unless we have motives, independent of the morality, to impel us to just actions, and deter us from unjust ones. Let those motives, therefore, be what they will, they must accommodate themselves to circumstances, and must admit of all the variations, which human affairs, in their incessant revolutions, are susceptible of. They are consequently a very improper foundation for such rigid inflexible rules as the laws of [justice?]; and 'tis evident these laws can only be deriv'd from human conventions, when men have perceiv'd the disorders that result from following their natural and variable principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我也不知道我怎么会在这个问题上轻易犯错。我清楚地看到，当任何一个人在与他人的行为中对自己施加一般的、僵硬的规则时，他就会把某些东西视为他们的财产，他认为这些东西是神圣的、不可侵犯的。但是，没有什么命题能比以下事实更明显了：如果不首先假定正义和非正义，财产是完全不可理解的；除非我们有独立于道德的动机，促使我们采取正义的行动，阻止我们采取非正义的行动，否则这些美德和恶行也是不可理解的。因此，不管这些动机是什么，它们都必须适应环境，而且必须接受所有的变化，而人类事务在不断的变化中是容易发生变化的。因此，它们是像[正义]法则这样僵硬的、不灵活的规则的一个非常不恰当的基础；很明显，这些法则只能从人类的惯例中推导出来，当人们意识到遵循其自然和可变原则所导致的混乱时。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Upon the whole, then, we are to consider this distinction betwixt justice and injustice, as having two different foundations, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> that of <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, when men observe, that 'tis impossible to live in society without restraining themselves by certain rules; and that of <i class="calibre10">morality</i>, when this interest is once observ'd, and men receive a pleasure from the view of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and an uneasiness from such as are contrary to it. 'Tis the voluntary convention and artifice of men, which makes the first interest take place; and therefore those laws of justice are so far to be consider'd as <i class="calibre10">artificial</i>. After that interest is once establish'd and acknowledge'd, the sense of morality in the observance of these rules follows <i class="calibre10">naturally</i>, and of itself; tho' 'tis certain, that it is also augmented by a new <i class="calibre10">artifice</i>, and that the public instructions of politicians, and the private education of parents, contribute to the giving us a sense of honour and duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">总的来说，我们应该把正义和非正义之间的这种区别看作是有两个不同的基础，<i class="calibre10">即</i> <i class="calibre10">利益</i>的基础，当人们观察到，在社会中生活不可能不受某些规则的约束；<i class="calibre10">道德</i>的基础，当这种利益一旦得到遵守，人们就会从那些有利于社会和平的行为中得到快乐，而从那些违背社会和平的行为中得到不安的情绪。正是人们的自愿约定和安排，使第一种利益得以实现；因此，那些正义的法律至今仍被认为是<i class="calibre10">人为的</i>。在这种利益一旦确立并得到承认之后，遵守这些规则的道德感就会<i class="calibre10">自然而然地</i>产生，而且本身就会产生；不过可以肯定的是，这种道德感也会通过一种新的<i class="calibre10">手段</i>得到加强，政治家的公开指示和父母的私人教育都有助于使我们在严格规范我们对他人财产的行为方面产生一种荣誉感和责任感。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Nothing is more certain, than that men are, in a great measure, govern'd by interest, and that even when they extend their concern beyond themselves, 'tis not to any great distance; nor is it usual for them, in common life, to look farther than their nearest friends and acquaintance. 'Tis no less certain, that 'tis impossible for men to consult their interest in so effectual a manner, as by an universal and inflexible observance of the rules of justice, by which alone they can preserve society, and keep themselves from falling into that wretched and savage condition, which is commonly represented as the <i class="calibre10">state of nature</i>. And as this interest, which all men have in the upholding of society, and the observation of the rules of justice, is great, so is it palpable and evident, even to the most rude and uncultivated of human race; and 'tis almost impossible for any one, who has had experience of society, to be mistaken in this particular. Since, therefore, men are so sincerely attach'd to their interest, and their interest is so much concern'd in the observance of justice, and this interest is so certain and avow'd; it may be ask'd, how any disorder can ever arise in, society, and what principle there is in human nature so <i class="calibre10">powerful</i> as to overcome so strong a passion, or so <i class="calibre10">violent</i> as to obscure so clear a knowledge?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">没有什么比人在很大程度上受利益的支配更确定的了，即使他们把自己的关注点扩大到自己以外的地方，也不会到很远的地方；在普通生活中，他们通常也不会把目光投向最近的朋友和熟人以外的地方。同样可以肯定的是，人们不可能以如此有效的方式来考虑他们的利益，就像普遍和灵活地遵守正义的规则一样，只有通过这种方式，他们才能维护社会，使自己不至于陷入通常被称为<i class="calibre10">自然状态</i>的悲惨和野蛮的状态。由于所有人在维护社会和遵守正义规则方面的这种利益是巨大的，因此，即使对人类中最粗鲁和最没有教养的人来说，这种利益也是明显的；而且，任何有社会经验的人几乎不可能在这方面犯错。因此，既然人们如此真诚地重视他们的利益，他们的利益如此关注对正义的遵守，而且这种利益是如此确定和公开的；人们可能会问，社会上怎么会出现任何混乱，人性中有什么原则如此<i class="calibre10">强大</i>，可以克服如此强烈的激情，或者如此<i class="calibre10">猛烈</i>，可以掩盖如此清晰的知识？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It has been observ'd, in treating of the passions, that men are mightily govern'd by the imagination, and proportion their affections more to the light, under which any object appears to them, than to its real and intrinsic value. What strikes upon them with a strong and lively idea commonly prevails above what lies in a more obscure light; and it must be a great superiority of value, that is able to compensate this advantage. Now as every thing, that is contiguous to us, either in space or time, strikes upon us with such an idea, it a proportional effect on the will and passions, and commonly operates with more force than any object, that lies in a more distant and obscure light. Tho' we may be fully convinc'd, that the latter object excels the former, we are not able to regulate our actions by this judgment; but yield to the solicitations of our passions, which always plead in favour of whatever is near and contiguous.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">据观察，在处理激情问题时，人们受想象力的支配，他们的感情更多的是根据任何物体在他们看来的光线，而不是其真实和内在的价值。对他们来说，具有强烈而生动的观念的东西通常要比处于更模糊的光线下的东西更受欢迎；能够弥补这种优势的一定是价值的巨大优势。现在，在空间或时间上与我们相邻的每一件事，都会以这样的观念冲击我们，它对意志和激情的影响是成正比的，通常比任何位于更遥远和晦暗光线下的物体更有力量。尽管我们可能完全相信后一个目标比前一个目标好，但我们却不能根据这一判断来调节我们的行动；而是屈服于我们的激情的诱惑，因为我们的激情总是恳求支持任何近在咫尺的东西。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This is the reason why men so often act in contradiction to their known interest; and in particular why they prefer any trivial advantage, that is present, to the maintenance of order in society, which so much depends on the observance of justice. The consequences of every breach of equity seem to lie very remote, and are not able to counterbalance any immediate advantage, that may be reap'd from it. They are, however, never the less real for being remote; and as all men are, in some degree, subject to the same weakness, it necessarily happens, that the violations of equity must become very frequent in society, and the commerce of men, by that means, be render' d very dangerous and uncertain. You have the same propension, that I have, in favour of what is contiguous above what is remote. You are, therefore, naturally carried to commit acts of injustice as well as me. Your example both pushes me forward in this way by imitation, and also affords me a new reason for any breach of equity, by shewing me, that I should be the cully of my integrity, if I alone shou'd impose on myself a severe restraint amidst the licentiousness of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是为什么人们的行为常常与他们已知的利益相悖的原因；尤其是为什么他们宁愿选择任何目前的微不足道的利益，也不愿维持社会秩序，而社会秩序在很大程度上取决于对正义的遵守。每一次违反公平的后果似乎都很遥远，而且无法抵消任何可能从中获得的直接利益。然而，这些后果并不因其遥远而不真实；由于所有人在某种程度上都受制于同样的弱点，因此必然会发生，违反公平的行为在社会上必须变得非常频繁，而人们的商业也会因此而变得非常危险和不确定。你和我有同样的倾向，认为相邻的东西比遥远的东西更有优势。因此，你和我一样，自然会做出不公正的行为。你的榜样既推动了我在这方面的模仿，也为我违反公平提供了新的理由，因为你告诉我，如果我在别人的放荡不羁中独自对自己施加严格的约束，我就会成为我诚信的骗子。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This quality, therefore, of human nature, not only is very dangerous to society, but also seems, on a cursory view, to be incapable of any remedy. The remedy can only come from the consent of men; and if men be incapable of themselves to prefer remote to contiguous, they will never consent to any thing, which wou'd oblige them to such a choice, and contradict, in so sensible a manner, their natural principles and propensities. Whoever chuses the means, chuses also the end; and if it be impossible for us to prefer what is remote, 'tis equally impossible for us to submit to any necessity, which wou'd oblige us to such a method of acting.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，人性的这种特质不仅对社会非常危险，而且从粗略的角度来看，似乎也没有任何补救的办法。补救措施只能来自于人们的同意；如果人们自己没有能力选择偏远地区而不是相邻地区，他们就永远不会同意任何事情，这将迫使他们做出这样的选择，并以如此明智的方式违背他们的自然原则和倾向。谁选择了手段，谁就选择了目的；如果我们不可能选择遥远的东西，那么我们也同样不可能服从任何迫使我们采取这种行动方式的必要性。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But here 'tis observable, that this infirmity of human nature becomes a remedy to itself, and that we provide against our negligence about remote objects, merely because we are naturally inclin'd to that negligence. When we consider any objects at a distance, all their minute distinctions vanish, and we always give the preference to whatever is in itself preferable, without considering its situation and circumstances. This gives rise to what in an improper sense we call <i class="calibre10">reason</i>, which is a principle, that is often contradictory to those propensities that display themselves upon the approach of the object. In reflecting on any action, which I am to perform a twelve-month hence, I always resolve to prefer the greater good, whether at that time it will be more contiguous or remote; nor does any difference in that particular make a difference in my present intentions and resolutions. My distance from the final determination makes all thou minute differences vanish, nor am I affected by any thing, but the general and more discernable qualities of good and evil. But on my nearer approach, those circumstances, which I at first over-look'd, begin to appear, and have an influence on my conduct and affections. A new inclination to the present good springs up, and makes it difficult for me to adhere inflexibly to my first purpose and resolution. This natural infirmity I may very much regret, and I may endeavour, by all possible means, to free my self from it. I may have recourse to study and reflection within myself; to the advice of friends; to frequent meditation, and repeated resolution: And having experience'd how ineffectual all these are, I may embrace with pleasure any other expedient, by which I may impose a restraint upon myself, and guard against this weakness.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但在这里可以看到，人类本性的这种弱点变成了对自己的补救，我们对远处物体的疏忽作出规定，只是因为我们天生就有这种疏忽的倾向。当我们在远处考虑任何物体时，它们所有的细微差别都消失了，我们总是优先考虑本身比较好的东西，而不考虑其情况和环境。这就产生了我们在不恰当的意义上称之为<i class="calibre10">理性的</i>东西，这是一个原则，它往往与那些在物体接近时显示出来的倾向性相矛盾。在思考任何我将在12个月后执行的行动时，我总是决心倾向于更大的利益，无论那时它是更邻近的还是更遥远的；在这一点上的任何差异也不会使我现在的意图和决议产生差异。我与最终决定的距离使所有细微的差别都消失了，我也不受任何东西的影响，只受一般的、更容易辨别的善恶品质的影响。但当我接近时，那些我起初忽视的情况开始出现，并对我的行为和情感产生影响。一种新的倾向性涌现出来，使我难以坚定地坚持我最初的目的和决心。我可能会对这种自然的弱点感到非常遗憾，我可能会通过一切可能的手段，努力使自己摆脱这种弱点。我可以求助于研究和反思自己的内心；求助于朋友的建议；求助于经常的冥想和反复的决心。在经历了所有这些都是无效的之后，我可能会高兴地接受任何其他的权宜之计，通过这些方法我可以对自己进行约束，并防止这种弱点。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">The only difficulty, therefore, is to find out this expedient, by which men cure their natural weakness, and lay themselves under the necessity of observing the laws of justice and equity, notwithstanding their violent pro pension to prefer contiguous to remote. 'Tis evident such a remedy can never be effectual without correcting this propensity; and as 'tis impossible to change or correct any thing material in our nature, the utmost we can do is to change our circumstances and situation, and render the observance of the laws of justice our nearest interest, and their violation our most remote. But this being impracticable with respect to all mankind, it can only take place with respect to a few, whom we thus immediately interest in the execution of justice. These are the persons, whom we call civil magistrates, kings and their ministers, our governors and rulers, who being indifferent persons to the greatest part of the state, have no interest, or but a remote one, in any act of injustice; and being satisfied with their present condition, and with their part in society, have an immediate interest in every execution of justice, which is so necessary to the upholding of society. Here then is the origin of civil government and society. Men are not able radically to cure, either in themselves or others, that narrowness of soul, which makes them prefer the present to the remote. They cannot change their natures. All they can do is to change their situation, and render the observance of justice the immediate interest of some particular persons, and its violation their more remote. These persons, then, are not only induc'd to observe those rules in their own conduct, but also to constrain others to a like regularity, and inforce the dictates of equity thro' the whole society. And if it be necessary, they may also interest others more immediately in the execution of justice, and create a number of officers, civil and military, to assist them in their government.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，唯一的困难是找到这个权宜之计，通过它，人们可以治愈他们天生的弱点，并使自己必须遵守正义和公平的法律，尽管他们有强烈的倾向于选择邻近的地方。显然，如果不纠正这种倾向，这样的补救措施就不可能有效；由于不可能改变或纠正我们天性中的任何实质性的东西，我们能做的就是改变我们的环境和状况，使遵守正义的法律成为我们最接近的利益，而违反它们则是最遥远的。但是，这对所有的人来说都是不可行的，所以只能对少数人进行改变，而这些人是我们在执行正义方面的直接利益所在。这些人就是我们所说的民政官员、国王和他们的大臣、我们的总督和统治者，他们对国家的大部分人来说是无所谓的人，对任何不公正的行为都没有兴趣，或者只有遥远的兴趣；他们对自己目前的状况和在社会中的角色感到满意，对每一次正义的执行都有直接的兴趣，这对维护社会是如此的必要。这就是公民政府和社会的起源。人无法从根本上治愈自己或他人的那种灵魂的狭隘，这种狭隘使他们宁愿选择现在而不愿选择远方。他们无法改变自己的本性。他们所能做的就是改变自己的处境，使遵守正义成为某些特定人的直接利益，而违反正义的行为则是比较遥远的。那么，这些人不仅要在自己的行为中遵守这些规则，而且还要约束其他人遵守同样的规则，并在整个社会中执行公平的指令。如果有必要，他们还可以让其他人更直接地参与到正义的执行中来，并设立一些民事和军事官员，以协助他们的管理。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But this execution of justice, tho' the principal, is not the only advantage of government. As violent passion hinders men from seeing distinctly the interest they have in an equitable behaviour towards others; so it hinders them from seeing that equity itself, and gives them a remarkable partiality in their own favours. This inconvenience is corrected in the same manner as that above-mention'd. The same persons, who execute the laws of justice, will also decide all controversies concerning them; and being indifferent to the greatest part of the society, will decide them more equitably than every one wou'd in his own cue.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但这种正义的执行，虽然是主要的，但并不是政府的唯一好处。由于剧烈的激情妨碍人们清楚地看到他们在对他人的公平行为中所拥有的利益；所以它也妨碍他们看到公平本身，并使他们在对自己的宠爱中产生明显的偏袒。这种不便可以用上述同样的方式得到纠正。执行正义法律的人，也将决定所有与之有关的争议；由于对社会的大部分人漠不关心，他们的决定将比每个人在自己的线索中更公平。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">By means of these two advantages, in the <i class="calibre10">execution</i> and <i class="calibre10">decision</i> of justice, men acquire a security against each others weakness and passion, as well as against their own, and under the shelter of their governors, begin to taste at ease the sweets of society and mutual assistance. But government extends farther its beneficial influence; and not contented to protect men in those conventions they make for their mutual interest, it often obliges them to make such conventions, and forces them to seek their own advantage, by a concurrence in some common end or purpose. There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value. Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because 'tis easy for them to know each others mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is the abandoning the whole project. But 'tis very difficult, and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou'd agree in any such action; it being difficult for them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difficult for them to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expence, and wou'd lay the whole burden on others. Political society easily remedies both these inconveniences. Magistrates find an immediate interest in the interest of any considerable part of their subjects. They need consult no body but themselves to form any scheme for the promoting of that interest. And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is commented, tho' not immediately, with the failure of the whole, they prevent that failure, because they find no interest in it, either immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours open'd; ramparts rais'd; canals form'd; fleets equip'd; and armies discipline'd; every where, by the care of government, which, tho' compos'd of men subject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the finest and most subtle inventions imaginable, a composition, which is, in some measure, exempted from all these infirmities.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">通过这两个优势，在<i class="calibre10">执行</i>和<i class="calibre10">决定</i>正义的过程中，人们获得了一种安全感，可以抵御对方的弱点和激情，也可以抵御自己的弱点和激情，在他们的统治者的庇护下，开始轻松地品尝社会和互助的甜头。但政府将其有益的影响扩大到更远的地方；它不满足于在人们为其共同利益而制定的那些公约中保护他们，而是经常迫使他们制定这样的公约，并迫使他们通过在某些共同的目的或目标上达成一致来寻求自己的利益。在人类的本性中，没有任何一种品质能在我们的行为中造成更多的致命错误，那就是导致我们喜欢眼前的东西而不喜欢遥远的东西，并使我们对物体的渴望更多的是根据它们的情况而不是它们的内在价值。两个邻居可能会同意把他们共同拥有的一块草地的水抽干；因为他们很容易了解对方的想法；而且每个人都必须意识到，他在自己的部分失败的直接后果是放弃整个项目。但是，要让一千人在任何这样的行动中达成一致是非常困难的，甚至是不可能的；他们很难协调如此复杂的设计，更难执行；而每个人都在寻找借口，以免除自己的麻烦和费用，并将整个负担推给别人。政治社会很容易弥补这两个方面的不便。行政官员发现，他们的任何相当一部分臣民的利益都有直接的利益。除了他们自己，他们不需要咨询任何机构来制定任何促进这种利益的计划。由于在执行过程中，任何一个部分的失败都会被评论为（尽管不是立即的）整体的失败，所以他们会阻止这种失败，因为他们发现这里面没有任何利益，无论是直接的还是遥远的。因此，桥梁的建造；港口的开辟；城墙的建立；运河的形成；舰队的装备；军队的纪律；每一个地方都有政府的关怀，虽然政府是由受人类所有弱点影响的人组成的，但通过一个可以想象的最好和最微妙的发明，成为一个在某种程度上免于所有这些弱点的组成部分。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Though government be an invention very advantageous, and even in some circumstances absolutely necessary to mankind; it is not necessary in all circumstances, nor is it impossible for men to preserve society for some time, without having recourse to such an invention. Men, 'tis true, are always much inclin'd to prefer present interest to distant and remote; nor is it easy for them to resist the temptation of any advantage, that they may immediately enjoy, in apprehension of an evil, that lies at a distance from them: But still this weakness is less conspicuous, where the possessions, and the pleasures of life are few, and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of society. An <i class="calibre10">Indian</i> is but little tempted to dispossess another of his hut, or to steal his bow, as being already provided of the same advantages; and as to any superior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting and fishing, 'tis only casual and temporary, and will have but small tendency to disturb society. And so far am I from thinking with some philosophers, that men are utterly incapable of society without government, that I assert the first rudiments of government to arise from quarrels, not among men of the same society, but among those of different societies. A less degree of riches will suffice to this latter effect, than is requisite for the former. Men fear nothing from public war and violence but the resistance they meet with, which, because they share it in common, seems less terrible; and because it comes from strangers, seems less pernicious in its consequences, than when they are expos'd singly against one whose commerce is advantageous to them, and without whose society 'tis impossible they can subsist. Now foreign war to a society without government necessarily produces civil war. Throw any considerable goods among men, they instantly fall a quarrelling, while each strives to get possession of what pleases him, without regard to the consequences. In a foreign war the most considerable of all goods, life and limbs, are at stake; and as every one shuns dangerous ports, seizes the best arms, seeks excuse for the slightest wounds, the laws, which may be well enough observ'd, while men were calm, can now no longer take place, when they are in such commotion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">尽管政府是一项非常有利的发明，甚至在某些情况下对人类来说是绝对必要的；但它并非在所有情况下都是必要的，人们也不可能在不求助于这种发明的情况下维持社会一段时间。诚然，人们总是更倾向于当前的利益，而不是远方的利益；他们也不容易抵制任何好处的诱惑，因为他们可能立即享受到离他们很远的邪恶。但是，在财产和生活乐趣不多、价值不高的地方，这种弱点就不那么明显了，因为在社会的初级阶段，它们总是这样。一个<i class="calibre10">印第安人</i>很少会剥夺别人的小屋或偷窃他的弓，因为他们已经得到了同样的好处；至于在打猎和捕鱼方面，一个人可能比另一个人更有优势，这只是偶然和暂时的，而且对社会的干扰很小。我与一些哲学家的想法相去甚远，他们认为人们完全不可能在没有政府的情况下建立社会，因此我断言，政府的最初雏形来自于争吵，而不是在同一社会的人之间，而是在不同社会的人之间。对于后一种效果，财富的程度要比前一种效果所需的程度要小。人们对公共战争和暴力没有任何恐惧，只是害怕他们遇到的抵抗，因为他们共同分享这种抵抗，所以似乎不那么可怕；因为这种抵抗来自陌生人，所以其后果似乎不那么有害，而当他们单独面对一个对他们有利的商业，没有这个社会，他们就不可能生存下去。现在，对于一个没有政府的社会来说，对外战争必然产生内战。把任何可观的货物扔给人们，他们马上就会争吵起来，而每个人都会努力占有自己喜欢的东西，而不考虑后果。在一场对外战争中，所有货物中最重要的生命和肢体都处于危险之中；由于每个人都避开危险的港口，夺取最好的武器，为最轻微的伤害寻找借口，当人们平静的时候可以很好地遵守的法律，在他们如此骚动的时候，现在就不能再进行了。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This we find verified in the <i class="calibre10">American</i> tribes, where men live in concord and amity among themselves without any establish'd government; and never pay submission to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when their captain enjoys a shadow of authority, which he loses after their return from the field, and the establishment of peace with the neighbouring tribes. This authority, however, instructs them in the advantages of government, and teaches them to have recourse to it, when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous inventions, their riches and possessions have become so considerable as to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest they have in the preservation of peace and justice. Hence we may give a plausible reason, among others, why all governments are at first monarchical, without any mixture and variety; and why republics arise only from the abuses of monarchy and despotic power. Camps are the true mothers of cities; and as war cannot be administred, by reason of the suddenness of every exigency, without some authority in a single person, the same kind of authority naturally takes place in that civil government, which succeeds the military. And this reason I take to be more natural, than the common one deriv'd from patriarchal government, or the authority of a father, which is said first to take place in one family, and to accustom the members of it to the government of a single person. The state of society without government is one of the most natural states of men, and must subsist with the conjunction of many families, and long after the first generation. Nothing but an encrease of riches and possessions cou'd oblige men to quit it; and so barbarous and uninstructed are all societies on their first formation, that many years must elapse before these can encrease to such a degree, as to disturb men in the enjoyment of peace and concord.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' it be possible for men to maintain a small uncultivated society without government, 'tis impossible they shou'd maintain a society of any kind without justice, and the observance of those three fundamental laws conceding the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises. These are, therefore, antecedent to government, and are suppos'd to impose an obligation before the duty of allegiance to civil magistrates has once been thought o£ Nay, I shall go farther, and assert, that government, <i class="calibre10">upon its first establishment</i>, wou'd naturally be suppos'd to derive its obligation from those laws of nature, and, in particular, from that concerning the performance of promises. When men have once perceiv'd the necessity of government to maintain peace, and execute justice, they wou'd naturally assemble together, wou'd chuse magistrates, determine their power, and <i class="calibre10">promise</i> them obedience. As a promise is suppos'd to be a bond or security already in use, and attended with a moral obligation, 'tis to be consider'd as the original sanction of government, and as the source of the first obligation to obedience. This reasoning appears so natural, that it has become the foundation of our fashionable system of politics, and is in a manner the creed of a party amongst us, who pride themselves, with reason, on the soundness of their philosophy, and their liberty of thought. All men, say they, <i class="calibre10">are born free and equal: Government and superiority can only by establish'd by consent: The consent of men, in establishing government, imposes on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of nature. Men, therefore, are bound to obey their magistrates, only because they promise it; and if they had not given their word, either expressly or tacitly, to preserve allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty</i>. This conclusion, however, when carried so far as to comprehend government in all its ages and situations, is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that tho' the duty of allegiance be at first grafted on the obligation of promises, and be for some time supported by that obligation, yet it quickly takes root of itself, and has an original obligation and authority, independent of all contracts. This is a principle of moment, which we must examine with care and attention, before we proceed any farther.</p>

These philosophers, therefore, quickly observe, that society is as antient as the human species, and those three fundamental laws of nature as antient as society: So that taking advantage of the antiquity, and obscure origin of these laws, they first deny them to be artificial and voluntary inventions of men, and then seek to ingraft on them those other duties, which are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceiv'd in this particular, and having found that <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, as well as <i class="calibre10">civil</i> justice, derives its origin from human conventions, we shall quickly perceive, how fruitless it is to resolve the one into the other, and seek, in the laws of nature, a stronger foundation for our political duties than interest, and human conventions; while these laws themselves are built on the very same foundation. On which ever side we turn this subject, we shall find, that these two kinds of duty are exactly on the same footing, and have the same source both of their <i class="calibre10">first invention</i> and <i class="calibre10">moral obligation</i>.

The same self-love, therefore, which renders men so incommodious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of justice, and is the <i class="calibre10">first</i> motive of their observance. But when men have observ'd, that tho' the rules of justice be sufficient to maintain any society, yet 'tis impossible for them, of themselves, to observe those rules, in large and polish'd societies; they establish government, as a new invention to attain their ends, and preserve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more strict execution of justice. So far, therefore, our <i class="calibre10">civil</i> duties are connected with our <i class="calibre10">natural</i>, that the former are invented chiefly for the sake of the latter; and that the principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature. In this respect, however, that law of nature, concerning the performance of promises, is only compriz'd along with the rest; and its exact observance is to be consider'd as an effect of the institution of government, and not the obedience to government as an effect of the obligation, of a promise.

		<p class="block_6 en">To make this more evident, let us consider, that men will often bind themselves by promises to the performance of what it wou'd have been their interest to perform, independent of these promises; as when they wou'd give others a fuller security, by super-adding a new obligation of interest to that which they formerly lay under. The interest in the performance of promises, besides its moral obligation, is general, avow'd, and of the last consequence in life. Other interests may be more particular and doubtful; and we are apt to entertain a greater suspicion, that men may indulge their humour, or passion, in acting contrary to them. Here, therefore, promises come naturally in play, and are often requir'd for fuller satisfaction and security. But supposing those other interests to be as general and avow'd as the interest in the performance of a promise, they will be regarded as on the same footing, and men will begin to repose the same confidence in them. Now this is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate; without which no government cou'd subsist, nor any peace or order be maintain'd in large societies, where there are so many possessions on the one hand, and so many wants, real or imaginary, on the other. Our civil duties, therefore, must soon detach themselves from our promises, and acquire a separate force and influence. The interest in both is of the very same kind: 'Tis general, avow'd, and prevails in all times and places. There is, then, no pretext of reason for founding the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar to itself. We might as well resolve the obligation to abstain from the possessions of others, into the obligation of a promise, as that of allegiance. The interests are not more distinct in the one case than the other. A regard to property is not more necessary to natural society, than obedience is to civil society or government; nor is the former society more necessary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their well-being and happiness. In short, if the performance of promises be advantageous, so is obedience to government: If the former interest be general, so is the latter: If the one interest be obvious and avow'd, so is the other. And as these two rules are founded on like obligations of interest, each of them must have a peculiar authority, independent of the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">为了使这一点更加明显，让我们考虑一下，人们经常会通过承诺来约束自己，使他们履行他们本来有兴趣履行的事情，而不需要这些承诺；就像他们要给别人一个更充分的保障，在他们以前所承担的利益上再加上一个新的义务。履行承诺的利益，除了它的道德义务外，是一般的、公开的，而且是生活中最后的结果。其他的利益可能更加特殊和可疑；而且我们很容易产生更大的怀疑，认为人们可能会放纵自己的幽默或激情，做出违背承诺的行为。因此，在这里，承诺会自然而然地发挥作用，而且往往需要更充分的满足和安全。但是，如果这些其他利益与履行承诺的利益一样普遍和公开，它们就会被视为处于同样的地位，人们就会开始对它们产生同样的信任。现在，我们的公民义务，或对行政长官的服从，正是这种情况；没有这种义务，任何政府都无法生存，任何和平或秩序都无法在大型社会中维持，因为一方面有这么多财产，另一方面有这么多真实或想象的需求。因此，我们的公民义务必须很快从我们的承诺中分离出来，并获得一种独立的力量和影响。两者的利益是相同的：它是普遍的，公开的，在所有的时间和地点都是如此。因此，没有任何理由将一个人建立在另一个人的基础上；而它们中的每一个人都有自己特有的基础。我们完全可以将放弃他人财产的义务转化为承诺的义务，而不是效忠的义务。一种情况下的利益并不比另一种情况更明显。对财产的重视对于自然社会来说，并不比服从对于公民社会或政府更有必要；前者对于人类的存在，也不比后者对于人类的福祉和幸福更有必要。简而言之，如果履行诺言是有利的，那么对政府的服从也是有利的。如果前者的利益是普遍的，后者的利益也是普遍的。如果一个利益是明显的、公开的，另一个也是如此。由于这两条规则是建立在类似的利益义务之上的，因此它们中的每一条都必须有独立于另一条的特殊权威。</p></div>

And indeed, if we consider the close connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obligations, we shall find this conclusion to be entirely unavoidable. Our interest is always engag'd on the side of obedience to magistracy; and there is nothing but a great present advantage, that can lead us to rebellion, by making us over-look the remote interest, which we have in the preserving of peace and order in society. But tho' a present interest may thus blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard to those of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true colours, as highly prejudicial to public interest, and to our own in particular. This naturally gives us an uneasiness, in considering such seditious and disloyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of vice and moral deformity. 'Tis the same principle, which causes us to disapprove of all kinds of private injustice, and in particular of the breach of promises. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; because we consider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with regard to promises. We blame all disloyalty to magistrates; because we perceive, that the execution of justice, in the stability of possession, its translation by consent, and the performance of promises, is impossible, without submission to government. As there are here two interests entirely distinct from each other, they must give rise to two moral obligations, equally separate and independant. Tho' there was no such thing as a promise in the world, government wou'd still be necessary in all large and civiliz'd societies; and if promises had only their own proper obligation, without the separate sanction of government, they wou'd have but little efficacy in such societies. This separates the boundaries of our public and private duties, and shews that the latter are more dependant on the former, than the former on the latter. <i class="calibre10">Education</i>, and <i class="calibre10">the artifice of politicians</i>, concur to bestow a farther morality on loyalty, and to brand all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy.

		<p class="block_6 en">Lest those arguments shou'd not appear entirely conclusive (as I think they are) I shall have recourse to authority, and shall prove, from the universal consent of mankind, that the obligation of submission to government is not deriv'd from any promise of the subjects. Nor need any one wonder, that tho' I have all along endeavour'd to establish my system on pure reason, and have scarce ever cited the judgment even of philosophers or historians on any article, I shou'd now appeal to popular authority, and oppose the sentiments of the rabble to any philosophical reasoning. For it must be observ'd, that the opinions of men, in this case, carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in a great measure, infallible. The distinction of moral good and evil is founded on the pleasure or pain, which results from the view of any sentiment, or character; and as that pleasure or pain cannot be unknown to the person who feels it, it follows, <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-163" id="calibre_link-388" title="75">75</a></sup>that there is just so much vice or virtue in any character, as every one places in it, and that 'tis impossible in this particular we can ever be mistaken.

A man, who acknowledges himself to be bound to another, for a certain sum, must certainly know whether it be by his own bond, or that of his father; whether it be of his mere goodwill, or for money lent him; and under what conditions, and for what purposes he has bound himself. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral obligation to submit to government, because every one thinks so; it must be as certain, that this obligation arises not from a promise; since no one, whose judgment has not been led astray by too strict adherence to a system of philosophy, has ever yet dreamt of ascribing it to that origin.

		<p class="block_6 en">We find, that magistrates are so far from deriving their authority, and the obligation to obedience in their subjects, from the foundation of a promise or original contract, that they conceal, as far as possible, from their people, especially from the vulgar, that they have their origin from thence. Were this the sanction of government, our rulers wou'd never receive it tacitly, which is the utmost that can be pretended; since what is given tacitly and insensibly can never have such influence on mankind, as what is perform'd expressly and openly. A tacit promise is, where the will is signified by other more diffuse signs than those of speech; but a will there must certainly be in the case, and that can never escape the person's notice, who exerted it, however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest part of the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers, or promis'd to obey them, they wou'd be inclin'd to think very strangely of you; and wou'd certainly reply, that the affair depended not on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. In consequence of this opinion, we frequently see them imagine such persons to be their natural rulers, as are at that time depriv'd of all power and authority, and whom no man, however foolish, wou'd voluntarily chuse; and this merely because they are in that line, which rul'd before, and in that degree of it, which us'd to succeed; tho perhaps in so distant a period, that scarce any man alive cou'd ever have given any promise of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over such as these, because they never consented to it, and wou'd esteem the very attempt of such a free choice a piece of arrogance and impiety? We find by experience, that it punishes them very freely for what it calls treason and rebellion, which, it seems. according to this system, reduces itself to common injustice. If you say, that by dwelling in its dominions, they in effect consented to the establish'd government; I answer, that this can only be, where they think the affair depends on their choice, which few or none, beside those philosophers, have ever yet imagin'd. It never was pleaded as an excuse for a rebel, that the first act he perform'd, after he came to years of discretion, was to levy war against the sovereign of the state; and that while he was a child he cou'd not bind himself by his own consent, and having become a man, show'd plainly, by the first act he perform'd, that he had no design to impose on himself any obligation to obedience. We find, on the contrary, that civil laws punish this crime at the same age as any other, which is criminal, of itself, without our consent; that is, when the person is come to the full use of reason: Whereas to this crime they ought in justice to allow some intermediate time, in which a tacit consent at least might be suppos'd. To which we may add, that a man living under an absolute government, wou'd owe it no allegiance; since, by its very nature, it depends not on consent. But as that is as <i class="calibre10">natural</i> and <i class="calibre10">common</i> a government as any, it must certainly occasion some obligation; and 'tis plain from experience, that men, who are subjected to it, do always think so. This is a clear proof, that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be deriv'd from our consent or promise; and a farther proof is, that when our promise is upon any account expressly engag'd, we always distinguish exactly betwixt the two obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other, than in a repetition of the same promise. Where no promise is given, a man looks not on his faith as broken in private matters, upon account of rebellion; but keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate. As the uniting of them was thought by these philosophers a very subtile invention, this is a convincing proof, that 'tis not a true one; since no man can either give a promise, or be restrain'd by its sanction and obligation unknown to himself.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们发现，行政官员远远没有从承诺或原始合同的基础上获得他们的权力，以及他们的臣民的服从义务，以至于他们尽可能地对他们的人民，特别是对粗俗的人，隐瞒他们来自于此的事实。如果这是政府的认可，我们的统治者绝不会默默地接受它，这是可以假装的最大限度；因为默默地和不明显地给予的东西永远不会像明确和公开地执行的东西那样对人类产生影响。默示的承诺是指，意愿是由其他比语言更广泛的迹象所表示的；但在这种情况下，肯定有一个意愿，而且无论如何沉默或默示，都无法逃过施加意愿的人的眼睛。但是，如果你问国民中最大的一部分人，他们是否曾同意他们的统治者的权威，或承诺服从他们，他们会对你产生非常奇怪的想法；他们肯定会回答说，这件事不取决于他们的同意，而是他们天生就应该这样服从。由于这种看法，我们经常看到他们把这种人想象成他们的自然统治者，因为当时他们被剥夺了所有的权力和权威，而且无论多么愚蠢的人都不会自愿选择这种人；这仅仅是因为他们是在以前统治过的那条线上，而且是在它的那个程度上，我们会继承；尽管也许是在如此遥远的时期，几乎没有任何活着的人能够给予任何服从的承诺。那么，政府对这样的人就没有权力，因为他们从来没有同意过，而且会认为这种自由选择的尝试是一种傲慢和不敬的行为？我们根据经验发现，它对他们所谓的叛国和反叛的惩罚是非常随意的，根据这种制度，这似乎是一种普通的不公正行为。如果你说，他们住在它的领地里，实际上就是同意了已经建立的政府；我回答说，这只能是在他们认为事情取决于他们的选择的情况下，而除了那些哲学家之外，很少有人或没有人想象过这种情况。从来没有人以反叛者为借口，说他在成年后所做的第一件事就是向国家的主权者发动战争；当他还是个孩子的时候，他不可能通过自己的同意来约束自己，而当他成为一个男人的时候，他所做的第一件事就清楚地表明，他没有打算让自己承担任何服从的义务。相反，我们发现，民法对这一罪行的惩罚与任何其他罪行的惩罚相同，而其他罪行本身就是犯罪，不需要我们的同意；也就是说，当一个人充分运用理智的时候。而对于这种罪行，他们应该公正地允许一些中间时间，至少可以认为是默许的。对此，我们可以补充说，一个生活在绝对政府下的人不会对其效忠；因为就其本质而言，它不取决于同意。但是，既然这是一个与其他政府一样<i class="calibre10">自然</i>和<i class="calibre10">普遍的</i>政府，它肯定会产生一些义务；而且根据经验，受制于它的人总是这样认为。这清楚地证明，我们通常不认为我们的忠诚来自我们的同意或承诺；另一个证据是，当我们的承诺在任何情况下被明确约定时，我们总是准确区分这两种义务，并认为其中一种义务比重复同一承诺更有力量。在没有承诺的情况下，一个人不会因为反叛而认为他的信仰在私事上被破坏；而是将荣誉和效忠这两项义务完全区分开来。由于这些哲学家认为将两者结合在一起是一个非常微妙的发明，这就是一个令人信服的证据，证明这不是一个真正的发明；因为没有人能够给出一个承诺，或者受到自己不知道的承诺和义务的约束。</p></div>

They wou'd prove, that our submission to government admits of exceptions, and that an egregious tyranny in the rulers is sufficient to free the subjects from all ties of allegiance. Since men enter into society, say they, and submit themselves to government, by their free and voluntary consent, they must have in view certain advantages, which they propose to reap from it, and for which they are contented to resign their native liberty. There is, therefore. something mutual engag'd on the part of the magistrate, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> protection and security; and 'tis only by the hopes he affords of these advantages, that he can ever persuade men to submit to him. But when instead of protection and security, they meet with tyranny and oppression, they are free'd from their promises, (as happens in all conditional contracts) and return to that state of liberty, which preceded the institution of government. Men wou'd never be so foolish as to enter into such engagements as shou'd turn entirely to the advantage of others, without any view of bettering their own condition. Whoever proposes to draw any profit from our submission, must engage himself, either expressly or tacitly. to make us reap some advantage from his authority; nor ought he to expect, that without the performance of his part we will ever continue in obedience.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">I repeat it: This conclusion is just, tho' the principles be erroneous; and I flatter myself, that I can establish the same conclusion on more reasonable principles. I shall not take such a compass, in establishing our political duties, as to assert, that men perceive the advantages of government; that they institute government with a view to those advantages; that this institution requires a promise of obedience: which imposes a moral obligation to a certain degree, but being conditional, ceases to be binding, whenever the other contracting party performs not his part of the engagement. I perceive, that a promise itself arises entirely from human conventions, and is invented with a view to a certain interest. I seek, therefore, some such interest more immediately connected with government, and which may be at once the original motive to its institution, and the source of our obedience to it. This interest I find to consist in the security and protection, which we enjoy in political society, and which we can never attain, when perfectly free and independent. As interest, therefore, is the immediate sanction of government, the one can have no longer being than the other; and whenever the civil magistrate carries his oppression so far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable, we are no longer bound to submit to it. The cause ceases; the effect must cease also.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我再说一遍。这个结论是公正的，尽管原则是错误的；而且我自鸣得意，我可以在更合理的原则上建立同样的结论。在确定我们的政治责任时，我不会采取这样的方式，即断言人们认识到政府的好处；他们建立政府是为了这些好处；这种制度要求承诺服从：这在一定程度上施加了道德义务，但由于是有条件的，只要另一缔约方不履行他的承诺，就不再有约束力。我意识到，承诺本身完全来自人类的习惯，是为了某种利益而发明的。因此，我在寻找某种与政府更直接相关的利益，它可能同时是政府机构的原始动机和我们服从它的来源。我发现这种利益包括安全和保护，我们在政治社会中享有这种安全和保护，而在完全自由和独立的情况下，我们永远不可能达到这种保护。因此，由于利益是对政府的直接认可，一个政府不可能比另一个政府存在得更久；每当民事裁判员的压迫达到使他的权威完全无法容忍的程度时，我们就不再有义务服从它。原因停止了，结果也必须停止。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far the conclusion is immediate and direct, concerning the natural obligation which we have to allegiance. As to the moral obligation, we may observe, that the maxim wou'd here be false, that <i class="calibre10">when the cause ceases, the effect must cease also</i>. For there is a principle of human nature, which we have frequently taken notice of, that men are mightily addicted to <i class="calibre10">general rules</i>, and that we often carry our maxims beyond those reasons, which first induc'd us to establish them. Where cases are similar in many circumstances, we are apt to put them on the same footing, without considering, that they differ in the most material circumstances, and that the resemblance is more apparent than real. It may, therefore, be thought, that in the case of allegiance our moral obligation of duty will not cease, even tho' the natural obligation of interest, which is its cause, has ceas'd; and that men may be bound by <i class="calibre10">conscience</i> to submit to a tyrannical government against their own and the public interest. And indeed, to the force of this argument I so far submit, as to acknowledge, that general rules commonly extend beyond the principles, on which they are founded; and that we seldom make any exception to them, unless that exception have the qualities of a general rule, and be founded on very numerous and common instances. Now this I assert to be entirely the present case. When men submit to the authority of others, 'tis to procure themselves some security against the wickedness and injustice of men, who are perpetually carried, by their unruly passions, and by their present and immediate interest, to the violation of all the laws of society. But as this imperfection is inherent in human nature, we know that it must attend men in all their states and conditions; and that those, whom we chuse for rulers, do not immediately become of a superior nature to the rest of mankind, upon account of their superior power and authority. What we expect from them depends not on a change of their nature but of their situation, when they acquire a more immediate interest in the preservation of order and the execution of justice. But besides that this interest is only more immediate in the execution of justice among their subjects; besides this, I say, we may often expect, from the irregularity of human nature, that they will neglect even this immediate interest, and be transported by their passions into all the excesses of cruelty and ambition. Our general knowledge of human nature, our observation of the past history of mankind, our experience of present times; all these causes must induce us to open the door to exceptions, and must make is conclude, that we may resist the more violent effects of supreme power, without any crime or injustice.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">到目前为止，关于我们对效忠的自然义务，结论是直接的、直接的。至于道德义务，我们可以看到，这里的格言是错误的，<i class="calibre10">即当原因停止时，结果也必须停止</i>。因为有一个我们经常注意到的人性原则，即人们非常沉迷于<i class="calibre10">一般的规则</i>，而且我们经常把我们的格言带到最初促使我们建立它们的那些理由之外。当案件在许多情况下都很相似时，我们很容易把它们放在同一基础上，而不考虑它们在最重要的情况下是不同的，而且相似性比真实性更明显。因此，人们可能会认为，在效忠的情况下，我们的道德义务不会停止，即使作为其原因的自然利益义务已经停止；人们可能会受到<i class="calibre10">良心</i>的约束，违背自己和公众的利益而服从一个暴政政府。事实上，对于这个论点的力量，我承认，一般的规则通常超越了它们所依据的原则；我们很少对它们作出例外，除非这种例外具有一般规则的特质，并且是建立在非常多和常见的事例之上。现在我断言，这完全是目前的情况。当人们服从于他人的权威时，是为了给自己争取一些安全感，以抵御人们的邪恶和不公正，这些人因其不羁的激情和当前及眼前的利益而不断地违反社会的所有法律。但是，由于这种不完美是人性中固有的，我们知道，它必须伴随着人的所有状态和条件；我们选择的那些统治者，并不因为他们的权力和权威的优越性而立即变得比其他人类更优越。我们对他们的期望不是取决于他们性质的改变，而是取决于他们的处境，当他们在维护秩序和执行正义方面获得更直接的利益时。但是，除了这种利益只是在他们的臣民中更直接地执行正义之外；除此之外，我要说的是，由于人性的不规则性，我们常常可以预期他们甚至会忽视这种直接的利益，而被他们的激情所驱使，陷入残酷和野心的所有过度行为。我们对人性的一般了解，我们对人类过去历史的观察，我们对当今时代的经验；所有这些原因必须促使我们为例外情况打开大门，必须使我们得出结论，我们可以抵制最高权力的更猛烈的影响，而没有任何犯罪或不公正。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Accordingly we may observe, that this is both the general practice and principle of mankind, and that no nation, that cou'd find any remedy, ever yet suffer'd the cruel ravages of a tyrant, or were blam'd for their resistance. Those who took up arms against <i class="calibre10">Dionysius</i> or <i class="calibre10">Nero</i>, or <i class="calibre10">Philip the second</i>, have the favour of every reader in the perusal of their history; and nothing but the most violent perversion of common sense can ever lead us to condemn them. 'Tis certain, therefore, that in all our notions of morals we never entertain such an absurdity as that of passive obedience, but make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression. The general opinion of mankind has some authority in all cases; but in this of morals 'tis perfectly infallible. Nor is it less infallible, because men cannot distinctly explain the principles, on which it is founded. Few persons can carry on this train of reasoning: 'Government is a mere human invention for the interest of society. Where the tyranny of the governor removes this interest, it also removes the natural obligation to obedience. The moral obligation is founded on the natural, and therefore must cease where <i class="calibre10">that</i> ceases; especially where the subject is such as makes us foresee very many occasions wherein the natural obligation may cease, and causes us to form a kind of general rule for the regulation of our conduct in such occurrences.' But tho' this train of reasoning be too subtile for the vulgar, 'tis certain, that all men have an implicit notion of it, and are sensible, that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public interest; and at the same time, that human nature is so subject to frailties and passions, as may easily pervert this institution, and change their governors into tyrants and public enemies. If the sense of common interest were not our original motive to obedience, I wou'd fain ask, what other principle is there in human nature capable of subduing the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to such a submission? Imitation and custom are not sufficient. For the question still recurs, what motive first produces those instances of submission, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the custom? There evidently is no other principle than common interest; and if interest first produces obedience to government, the obligation to obedience must cease, whenever the interest ceases, in any great degree, and in a considerable number of instances.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们可以看到，这既是人类的普遍做法，也是人类的原则，没有一个国家，可以找到任何补救措施，但却遭受暴君的残酷蹂躏，或因反抗而受到责备。那些拿起武器反对<i class="calibre10">狄奥尼修斯</i> <i class="calibre10">或尼禄</i>，或<i class="calibre10">菲利普二世</i>的人，在阅读他们的历史时都会得到每个读者的青睐；除了对常识最激烈的颠倒之外，没有什么能让我们谴责他们。因此，可以肯定的是，在我们所有的道德观念中，我们从来没有接受过被动服从这样的荒唐事，而是允许在更公然的暴政和压迫的情况下进行抵抗。人类的普遍意见在任何情况下都有一定的权威性；但在道德方面，它是完全无懈可击的。因为人们无法清楚地解释它所依据的原则，所以它也不那么无懈可击。很少有人能进行这样的推理："政府只是人类为了社会的利益而发明的。当统治者的暴政取消了这种利益时，它也取消了服从的自然义务。道德义务是建立在自然的基础上的，因此在<i class="calibre10">自然</i>义务停止的地方必须停止；特别是当这个问题使我们预见到许多自然义务可能停止的场合，并使我们形成一种一般规则，在这种情况下规范我们的行为。但是，尽管这套推理对普通人来说过于微妙，但可以肯定的是，所有的人都有一个隐含的概念，并且意识到，他们对政府的服从仅仅是出于公共利益的考虑；同时，人性是如此的脆弱和激情，以至于可能很容易扭曲这一制度，并将他们的统治者变成暴君和公敌。如果共同利益的意识不是我们服从的原始动机，我想问，在人性中还有什么原则能够制服人的自然野心，并迫使他们如此服从？模仿和习惯是不够的。因为问题仍然存在，是什么动机首先产生了我们所模仿的那些屈服的例子，以及产生习俗的那一系列行动？显然，除了共同利益之外，没有其他原则；如果利益首先产生对政府的服从，那么只要利益停止，在很大程度上，在相当多的情况下，服从的义务就必须停止。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Since then such a blind submission is commonly due to magistracy, the next question is, <i class="calibre10">to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard as our lawful magistrates?</i> In order to answer this question, let us recollect what we have already establish'd conceding the origin of government and political society. When men have once experience'd the impossibility of preserving any steady order in society, while every one is his own master, and violates or observes the laws of society, according to his present interest or pleasure, they naturally run into the invention of government, and put it out of their own power, as far as possible, to transgress the laws of society. Government, therefore, arises from the voluntary convention of men; and 'tis evident, that the same convention, which establishes government, will also determine the persons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and ambiguity in this particular. And the voluntary consent of men must here have the greater efficacy, that the authority of the magistrate does <i class="calibre10">at first</i> stand upon the foundation of a promise of the subjects, by which they bind themselves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement. The same promise, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to a particular person, and makes him the object of their allegiance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然这种盲目的服从通常是对行政机构应有的，那么下一个问题是，<i class="calibre10">它是对谁应有的，我们应该把谁看作是我们合法的行政机构？</i>为了回答这个问题，让我们回顾一下我们在承认政府和政治社会的起源时已经确定的内容。当人们一旦体验到不可能维持社会的任何稳定秩序，而每个人都是自己的主人，并根据自己目前的利益或乐趣违反或遵守社会的法律时，他们自然就会发明政府，并尽可能地将其置于自己的权力之外，去违反社会的法律。因此，政府产生于人们的自愿约定；很明显，建立政府的同一约定也将决定由谁来管理，并将消除这方面的所有疑问和含糊之处。人们的自愿同意在这里必须具有更大的效力，因为行政长官的权力<i class="calibre10">首先</i>是建立在臣民的承诺基础上的，他们通过这种承诺来约束自己的服从；就像在其他任何合同或约定中一样。那么，使他们服从的同一承诺，将他们与一个特定的人联系在一起，并使他成为他们效忠的对象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But when government has been establish'd on this footing for some considerable time, and the separate interest, which we have in submission, has produc'd a separate sentiment of morality, the case is entirely alter'd, and a promise is no longer able to determine the particular magistrate; since it is no longer consider'd as the foundation of government. We naturally suppose ourselves born to submission; and imagine, that such particular persons have a right to command, as we on our part are bound to obey. These notions of right and obligation are deriv'd from nothing but the advantage we reap from government, which gives us a repugnance to practise resistance ourselves, and makes us displeas'd with any instance of it in others. But here 'tis remarkable, that in this new state of affairs, the original sanction of government, which is <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, is not admitted to determine the persons, whom we are to obey, as the original sanction did at first, when affairs were on the footing of a <i class="calibre10">promise</i>. A <i class="calibre10">promise</i> fixes and determines the persons, without any uncertainty: But 'tis evident, that if men were to regulate their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar <i class="calibre10">interest</i>, either public or private, they wou'd involve themselves in endless confusion, and wou'd render all government, in a great measure, ineffectual. The private interest of every one is different; and tho' the public interest in itself be always one and the same, yet it becomes the source of as great dissentions, by reason of the different opinions of particular persons concerning it. The same interest, therefore, which causes us to submit to magistracy, makes us renounce itself in the choice of our magistrates, and binds us down to a certain form of government, and to particular persons, without allowing us to aspire to the utmost perfection in either. The case is here the same as in that law of nature conceding the stability of possession. 'Tis highly advantageous, and even absolutely necessary to society, that possession shou'd be stable; and this leads us to the establishment of such a rule: But we find, that were we to follow the same advantage, in assigning particular possessions to particular persons, we shou'd disappoint our end, and perpetuate the confusion, which that rule is intended to prevent. We must, therefore, proceed by general rules, and regulate ourselves by general interests, in modifying the law of nature concerning the stability of possession. Nor need we fear, that our attachment to this law will diminish upon account of the seeming frivolousness of those interests, by which it is determin'd. The impulse of the mind is deriv'd from a very strong interest; and those other more minute interests serve only to direct the motion, without adding any thing to it, or diminishing from it. 'Tis the same case with government. Nothing is more advantageous to society than such an invention; and this interest is sufficient to make us embrace it with ardour and alacrity; tho' we are oblig'd afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by several considerations, which are not of the same importance, and to chuse our magistrates without having in view any particular advantage from the choice.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，当政府已经在这个基础上建立了相当长的时间，而且我们在服从中的单独利益已经产生了一种单独的道德情感，情况就完全改变了，一个承诺不再能够决定特定的行政长官；因为它不再被认为是政府的基础。我们自然而然地认为自己生来就是为了服从；并且想象，这些特定的人有权利指挥，就像我们有义务服从一样。这些关于权利和义务的概念，除了我们从政府中获得的好处外，没有其他原因，这使我们对自己的抵抗行为感到厌恶，并使我们对他人的任何抵抗行为感到不满。但这里值得注意的是，在这种新的事务状况下，政府的原始批准，即<i class="calibre10">利益</i>，不被允许决定我们要服从的人，就像最初事务处于<i class="calibre10">承诺</i>的基础上时，原始批准所做的那样。但很明显的是，如果人们通过对公共或私人的特殊<i class="calibre10">利益</i>的看法来规范他们在这方面的行为，他们就会使自己陷入无尽的混乱之中，并使所有政府在很大程度上失去效力。每个人的私人利益都是不同的；尽管公共利益本身总是相同的，但由于特定的人对它有不同的看法，它也会成为巨大争议的根源。因此，同样的利益，导致我们服从于行政机构，使我们在选择行政人员时放弃了自己，并将我们束缚在某种政府形式和特定的人身上，而不允许我们在任何一种形式中追求最大的完美。这里的情况与自然法则中承认占有的稳定性是一样的。占有的稳定性对社会是非常有利的，甚至是绝对必要的；这使我们建立了这样一条规则：但我们发现，如果我们遵循同样的好处，把特定的占有分配给特定的人，我们就会辜负我们的目的，并使这种混乱永久化，而这种混乱正是这条规则要防止的。因此，在修改有关财产稳定性的自然法则时，我们必须按照一般规则行事，并以一般利益来规范自己。我们也不必担心，我们对这一法则的依恋会因为那些决定它的利益的看似轻率而减少。心灵的冲动来自于一种非常强烈的利益；而其他更细微的利益只是为了引导运动，并没有给它增加任何东西，或减少它。政府的情况也是如此。没有什么比这种发明对社会更有利的了；这种利益足以使我们热切地拥抱它；尽管我们后来不得不通过一些不具有同等重要性的考虑来调节和指导我们对政府的奉献，并在没有考虑到从选择中获得任何特殊好处的情况下选择我们的行政长官。</p></div>

We naturally judge of every thing by comparison; and since in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics, we embrace a long extent of time, a small duration has not in this case a like influence on our sentiments, as when we consider any other object. One thinks he acquires a right to a horse, or a suit of cloaths, in a very short time; but a century is scarce sufficient to establish any new government, or remove all scruples in the minds of the subjects concerning it. Add to this, that a shorter period of time will suffice to give a prince a title to any additional power he may usurp, than will serve to fix his right, where the whole is an usurpation.

In elective monarchies the right of succession has no place by the laws and settled custom; and yet its influence is so natural, that 'tis impossible entirely to exclude it from the imagination, and render the subjects indifferent to the son of their deceas'd monarch. Hence in some governments of this kind, the choice commonly falls on one or other of the royal family; and in some governments they are all excluded. Those contrary phænomena proceed from the same principle. Where the royal family is excluded, 'tis from a refinement in politics, which makes people sensible of their propensity to chuse a sovereign in that family, and gives them a jealousy of their liberty, lest their new monarch, aided by this propensity, shou'd establish his family, and destroy the freedom of elections for the future.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">This leads us to consider the <i class="calibre10">fifth</i> source of authority, viz. <i class="calibre10">positive laws</i>; when the legislature establishes a certain form of government and succession of princes. At first sight it may be thought, that this must resolve into some of the preceding titles of authority. The legislative power, whence the positive law is deriv'd, must either be establish'd by original contract, long possession, present possession, conquest, or succession; and consequently the positive law must derive its force from some of those principles. But here 'tis remarkable, that tho' a positive law can only derive its force from these principles, yet it acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is deriv'd, but loses considerably in the transition; as it is natural to imagine. For instance; a government is establish'd for many centuries on a certain system of laws, forms, and methods of succession. The legislative power, establish'd by this long succession, changes all on a sudden the whole system of government, and introduces a new constitution in its stead. I believe few of the subjects will think themselves bound to comply with this alteration, unless it have an evident tendency to the public good: But will think themselves still at liberty to return to the antient government. Hence the notion of <i class="calibre10">fundamental</i> laws; which are suppos'd to be inalterable by the will of the sovereign: And of this nature the <i class="calibre10">Salic</i> law is understood to be in <i class="calibre10">France</i>. How far these fundamental laws extend is not determin'd in any government; nor is it possible it ever shou'd. There is such an insensible gradation from the most material laws to the most trivial, and from the most antient laws to the most modern, that 'twill be impossible to set bounds to the legislative power, and determine how far it may innovate in the principles of government. That is the work more of imagination and passion than of reason.</p>

In this particular, the study of history confirms the reasonings of true philosophy; which, shewing us the original qualities of human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies in politics as incapable of any decision in most cases, and as entirely subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty.

Ought the Roman empire at that time to be esteem'd hereditary, because of two examples; or ought it, even so early, to be regarded as belonging to the stronger, or the present possessor, as being founded on so recent an usurpation?

		<p class="block_6 en">But here an <i class="calibre10">English</i> reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous <i class="calibre10">revolution</i>, which has had such a happy influence on our constitution, and has been attended with such mighty consequences. We have already remark'd, that in the case of enormous tyranny and oppression, 'tis lawful to take arms even against supreme power; and that as government is a mere human invention for mutual advantage and security, it no longer imposes any obligation, either natural or moral, when once it ceases to have that tendency. But tho' this general principle be authoriz'd by common sense, and the practice of all ages, 'tis certainly impossible for the laws, or even for philosophy, to establish any <i class="calibre10">particular</i> rules, by which we may know when resistance is lawful; and decide all controversies, which may arise on that subject. This may not only happen with regard to supreme power; but 'tis possible, even in some constitutions, where the legislative authority is not lodg'd in one person, that there may be a magistrate so eminent and powerful, as to oblige the laws to keep silence in this particular. Nor wou'd this silence be an effect only of their <i class="calibre10">respect</i>, but also of their <i class="calibre10">prudence</i>; since 'tis certain, that in the vast variety of circumstances, which occur in all governments, an exercise of power, in so great a magistrate, may at one time be beneficial to the public, which at another time wou'd be pernicious and tyrannical. But notwithstanding this silence of the laws in limited monarchies, 'tis certain, that the people still retain the right of resistance; since 'tis impossible, even in the most despotic governments, to deprive them of it. The same necessity of self-preservation, and the same motive of public good, give them the same liberty in the one case as in the other. And we may farther observe, that in such mix'd governments, the cases, wherein resistance is lawful, must occur much oftener, and greater indulgence be given to the subjects to defend themselves by force of arms, than in arbitrary governments. Not only where the chief magistrate enters into measures, in themselves, extremely pernicious to the public, but even when he wou'd encroach on the other parts of the constitution, and extend his power beyond the legal bounds, it is allowable to resist and dethrone him; tho' such resistance and violence may, in the general tenor of the laws, be deem'd unlawful and rebellious. For besides that nothing is more essential to public interest, than the preservation of public liberty; 'tis evident, that if such a mix'd government be once suppos'd to be establish'd, every part or member of the constitution must have a right of self-defence, and of maintaining its antient bounds against the encroachment of every other authority. As matter wou'd have been created in vain, were it depriv'd of a power of resistance, without which no part of it cou'd preserve a distinct existence, and the whole might be crowded up into a single point: So 'tis a gross absurdity to suppose, in any government, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the supreme power is shar'd with the people, without allowing, that 'tis lawful for them to defend their share against every invader. Those, therefore, who wou'd seem to respect our free government, and yet deny the right of resistance, have renounc'd all pretensions to common sense, and do not merit a serious answer.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">但在这里，<i class="calibre10">英国</i>读者很可能会问及那场著名的<i class="calibre10">革命</i>，它对我们的宪法产生了如此愉快的影响，并带来了如此巨大的后果。我们已经说过，在巨大的暴政和压迫的情况下，即使拿起武器反对最高权力也是合法的；由于政府仅仅是人类为了互利和安全而发明的，所以一旦它不再有这种倾向，就不再有任何义务，无论是自然的还是道德的。但是，尽管这一一般原则得到了常识和所有时代的实践的认可，但法律甚至哲学当然不可能确立任何<i class="calibre10">特定的</i>规则，使我们能够知道什么时候抵抗是合法的；并决定在这个问题上可能出现的所有争议。这不仅可能发生在最高权力方面；甚至在一些宪法中，立法权不在一个人身上，也有可能出现一个如此显赫和强大的行政长官，迫使法律在这方面保持沉默。这种沉默也不仅仅是<i class="calibre10">尊重</i>的结果，也是<i class="calibre10">谨慎</i>的结果；因为可以肯定的是，在所有政府中都会出现各种各样的情况，在如此伟大的行政长官身上行使权力，在某一时刻可能对公众有利，而在另一时刻却可能是有害的和暴虐的。但是，尽管在有限的君主制国家中法律保持沉默，但可以肯定的是，人民仍然保留着抵抗的权利；因为即使在最专制的政府中，也不可能剥夺他们的权利。同样的自我保护的必要性和同样的公共利益的动机，使他们在一种情况下和在另一种情况下拥有同样的自由。我们还可以进一步观察到，在这样的混合政府中，抵抗是合法的，这种情况必须经常发生，而且与专制政府相比，要更多地放纵臣民用武力保护自己。不仅在首席行政官采取的措施本身对公众极为有害的情况下，而且甚至在他侵犯宪法的其他部分，并将其权力扩大到法律范围之外的情况下，也允许抵制和废止他；尽管这种抵制和暴力在法律的一般主旨中可能被视为非法和叛乱的。因为对公共利益来说，没有什么比维护公共自由更重要的了；很明显，如果这样一个混合政府一旦被认为建立起来，宪法的每一部分或成员都必须有自卫的权利，并维护其原有的界限，反对其他任何当局的侵占。就像物质如果被剥夺了抵抗力，那么它的创造就是徒劳的，没有抵抗力，它的任何部分都不可能保持独特的存在，而整体可能被挤成一个点。因此，在任何政府中，假设有权利而没有补救措施，或允许最高权力由人民分享，而不允许他们合法地捍卫自己的那部分权利，反对每一个入侵者，这都是非常荒谬的。因此，那些似乎尊重我们的自由政府，但却否认抵抗权的人，已经放弃了对常识的所有推崇，不值得认真回答。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">First</i>, We may observe, that shou'd the <i class="calibre10">lords</i> and <i class="calibre10">commons</i> in our constitution, without any reason from public interest, either depose the king in being, or after his death exclude the prince, who, by laws and settled custom, ought to succeed, no one wou'd esteem their proceedings legal, or think themselves bound to comply with them. But shou'd the king, by his unjust practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and despotic power, justly forfeit his legal, it then not only becomes morally lawful and suitable to the nature of political society to dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewise to think, that the remaining members of the constitution acquire a right of excluding his next heir, and of chusing whom they please for his successor. This is founded on a very singular quality of our thought and imagination. When a king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the same situation, as if the king were remov'd by death; unless by mixing himself in the tyranny, he forfeit it for himself. But tho' this may seem reasonable, we easily comply with the contrary opinion. The deposition of a king, in such a government as ours, is certainly an act beyond all common authority, and an illegal assuming a power for public good, which, in the ordinary course of government, can belong to no member of the constitution. When the public good is so great and so evident as to justify the action, the commendable use of this licence causes us naturally to attribute to the <i class="calibre10">parliament</i> a right of using farther licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once transgressed with approbation, we are not apt to be so strict in confining ourselves precisely within their limits. The mind naturally runs on with any train of action, which it has begun; nor do we commonly make any scruple concerning our duty, after the first action of any kind, which we perform. Thus at the <i class="calibre10">revolution</i>, no one who thought the deposition of the father justifiable, esteem'd themselves to be confin'd to his infant son; tho' had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that time, and had his son, by any accident, been convey'd beyond seas, there is no doubt but a regency wou'd have been appointed till he shou'd come to age, and cou'd be restor'd to his dominions. As the slightest properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people, it shews the wisdom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of such properties, and to chuse the magistrates either in or out of a line, according as the vulgar will most naturally attribute authority and right to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">首先</i>，我们可以看到，如果在我们的宪法中，<i class="calibre10">上议院</i>和<i class="calibre10">下议院</i>在没有任何公共利益理由的情况下，要么废黜正在执政的国王，要么在他死后排除根据法律和既定习俗应该继任的王子，没有人会认为他们的程序是合法的，或认为自己有义务遵守他们。但是，如果国王因其不公正的做法，或因其试图获得暴政和专制的权力，正当地丧失了他的合法地位，那么，废黜他不仅在道德上是合法的，而且适合政治社会的性质；更重要的是，我们很容易认为，宪法的其余成员获得了排除其下一个继承人的权利，并选择他们喜欢的人作为其继承人。这是建立在我们的思想和想象力的一个非常奇怪的品质上的。当一个国王放弃他的权力时，他的继承人自然应该保持同样的状况，就像国王被免职一样；除非他把自己混入暴政，为自己放弃暴政。尽管这看起来很合理，但我们还是很容易就接受了相反的观点。在我们这样的政府中，废黜国王无疑是一种超越所有普通权力的行为，是为了公共利益而非法行使权力，而在政府的正常运作过程中，这种权力不可能属于宪法的任何成员。当公共利益是如此之大，如此之明显，以至于可以证明这种行为的合理性时，这种许可的使用值得赞扬，我们自然会把使用更多许可的权利归于<i class="calibre10">议会</i>；法律的古老界限一旦被越过，就会得到认可，我们就不会那么严格地把自己精确地限制在其范围内。心灵自然会继续进行它已经开始的任何行动；我们通常也不会在第一次执行任何种类的行动后对我们的责任有任何顾虑。因此，在<i class="calibre10">革命</i>中，没有人认为废黜父亲是合理的，他们认为自己应该被限制在他的幼子身上；尽管那个不幸的君主当时无辜死亡，而他的儿子由于任何意外被送到了海洋之外，毫无疑问，人们会指定一个摄政者，直到他成年，并可以恢复他的统治。由于想象力的最微小的特性对人们的判断有影响，这表明法律和议会利用这种特性的智慧，并根据俗人最自然地将权力和权利归于他们的情况，选择行政长官，或在一行或不在一行。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en"><i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, Tho' the accession of the <i class="calibre10">Prince of Orange</i> to the throne might at first give occasion to many disputes, and his title be contested, it ought not now to appear doubtful, but must have acquir'd a sufficient authority from those three princes, who have succeeded him upon the same title. Nothing is more usual, tho' nothing may, at first sight, appear more unreasonable, than this way of thinking. Princes often <i class="calibre10">seem</i> to acquire a right from their successors, as well as from their ancestors; and a king, who during his life-time might justly be deem'd an usurper, will be regarded by posterity as a lawful prince, because he has had the good fortune to settle his family on the throne, and entirely change the antient form of government. <i class="calibre10">Julius Cæsar</i> is regarded as the first Roman emperor; while <i class="calibre10">Sylla</i> and <i class="calibre10">Marius</i>, whose titles were really the same as his, are treated as tyrants and usurpers. Time and custom give authority to all forms of government, and all successions of princes; and that power, which at first was founded only on injustice and violence. becomes in time legal and obligatory. Nor does the mind rest there; but returning back upon its footsteps, transfers to their predecessors and ancestors that right, which it naturally ascribes to the posterity, as being related together, and united in the imagination.

		<p class="block_6 en">When civil government has been establish'd over the greatest part of mankind, and different societies have been form'd contiguous to each other, there arises a new set of duties among the neighbouring states, suitable to the nature of that commerce, which they carry on with each other. Political writers tell us, that in every kind of intercourse, a body politic is to be consider'd as one person; and indeed this assertion is so far just, that different nations, as well as private persons, require mutual assistance; at the same time that their selfishness and ambition are perpetual sources of war and discord. But tho' nations in this particular resemble individuals, yet as they are very different in other respects, no wonder they regulate themselves by different maxims, and give rise to a new set of rules, which we call <i class="calibre10">the laws of nations</i>. Under this head we may comprize the sacredness of the persons of ambassadors, the declaration of war, the abstaining from poison'd arms, with other duties of that kind, which are evidently calculated for the commerce, that is peculiar to different societies.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">当人类的大部分地区都建立了文官政府，不同的社会也相互毗连，相邻的国家之间就会产生一套新的义务，以适应他们相互之间进行的贸易的性质。政治家们告诉我们，在每一种交往中，政治体都应被视为一个人；事实上，这种说法到目前为止是正确的，不同的国家和个人都需要相互帮助；同时，他们的自私和野心是战争和不和谐的永久来源。尽管国家在这一点上与个人相似，但由于它们在其他方面有很大的不同，难怪它们会用不同的格言来规范自己，并产生了一套新的规则，我们称之为<i class="calibre10">国家法</i>。在这个标题下，我们可以把大使身份的神圣性、宣战、不使用有毒武器，以及其他类似的义务都放在一起，这些义务显然是为不同社会所特有的商业而设计的。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' these rules be super-added to the laws of nature, the former do not entirely abolish the latter; and one may safely affirm, that the three fundamental rules of justice, the stability of possession, its transference by consent, and the performance of promises, are duties of princes, as well as of subjects. The same interest produces the same effect in both cases. Where possession has no stability, there must be perpetual war. Where property is not transfer'd by consent, there can be no commerce. Where promises are not observ'd, there can be no leagues nor alliances. The advantages, therefore, of peace, commerce, and mutual succour, make us extend to different kingdoms the same notions of justice, which take place among individuals.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">There is a maxim very current in the world, which few politicians are willing to avow, but which has been authoriz'd by the practice of all ages, <i class="calibre10">that there is a system of morals calculated for princes, much more free than that which ought to govern private persons</i>. 'Tis evident this is not to be understood of the lesser <i class="calibre10">extent</i> of public duties and obligations; nor will any one be so extravagant as to assert, that the most solemn treaties ought to have no force among princes. For as princes do actually form treaties among themselves, they must propose some advantage from the execution of them; and the prospect of such advantage for the future must engage them to perform their part, and must establish that law of nature. The meaning, therefore, of this political maxim is, that tho' the morality of princes has the same <i class="calibre10">extent</i>, yet it has not the same <i class="calibre10">force</i> as that of private persons, and may lawfully be transgress'd from a more trivial motive.

		<p class="block_6 en">When men have found by experience, that 'tis impossible to subsist without society, and that 'tis impossible to maintain society, while they give free course to their appetites; so urgent an interest quickly restrains their actions, and imposes an obligation to observe those rules, which we call <i class="calibre10">the laws of justice</i>. This obligation of interest rests not here; but by the necessary course of the passions and sentiments, gives rise to the moral obligation of duty; while we approve of such actions as tend to the peace of society, and disapprove of such as tend to its disturbance. The same <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation of interest takes place among independent kingdoms, and gives rise to the same <i class="calibre10">morality</i>; so that no one of ever so corrupt morals will approve of a prince, who voluntarily, and of his own accord, breaks his word, or violates any treaty. But here we may observe, that tho' the intercourse of different states be advantageous, and even sometimes necessary, yet it is not so necessary nor advantageous as that among individuals, without which 'tis utterly impossible for human nature ever to subsist. Since, therefore, the <i class="calibre10">natural</i> obligation to justice, among different states, is not so strong as among individuals, the mural obligation, which arises from it, must partake of its weakness; and we must necessarily give a greater indulgence to a prince or minister, who deceives another; than to a private gentleman, who breaks his word of honour.</p>

One may safely affirm, that this proportion finds itself, without any art or study of men; as we may observe on many other occasions. The practice of the world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty, than the most subtile philosophy, which was ever yet invented. And this may serve as a convincing proof, that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation of those moral rules concerning natural and civil justice, and are sensible, that they arise merely from human conventions, and from the interest, which we have in the preservation of peace and order. For otherwise the diminution of the interest wou'd never produce a relaxation of the morality, and reconcile us more easily to any transgression of justice among princes and republics, than in the private commerce of one subject with another.</p>

But in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this restraint, and undergo cheerfully all the fatigues and expences, to which it subjects them, they must believe, that the children are their own, and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object, when they give a loose to love and tenderness. Now if we examine the structure of the human body, we shall find, that this security is very difficult to be attain'd on our part; and that since, in the copulation of the sexes, the principle of generation goes from the man to the woman, an error may easily take place on the side of the former, tho' it be utterly impossible with regard to the latter.

Men are induc'd to labour for the maintenance and education of their children, by the persuasion that they are really their own; and therefore 'tis reasonable, and even necessary, to give them some security in this particular. This security cannot consist entirely in the imposing of severe punishments on any transgressions of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; since these public punishments cannot be inflicted without legal proof, which 'tis difficult to meet with in this subject. What restraint, therefore, shall we impose on women, in order to counter-balance so strong a temptation as they have to infidelity? There seems to be no restraint possible, but in the punishment of bad fame or reputation; a punishment, which has a mighty influence on the human mind, and at the same time is inflicted by the world upon surmizes, and conjectures, and proofs, that wou'd never be receiv'd in any court of judicature. In order, therefore, to impose a due restraint on the female sex, we must attach a peculiar degree of shame to their infidelity, above what arises merely from its injustice, and must bestow proportion able praises on their chastity.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果一个哲学家要先验地研究这个问题，他就会按照以下方式进行推理。人们由于相信他们的孩子确实是自己的孩子，所以才会为他们的生活和教育而努力；因此，在这方面给他们一些保障是合理的，甚至是必要的。这种保障不能完全包括对妻子违反夫妻忠诚的行为进行严厉的惩罚；因为如果没有法律证据，就不能进行这些公开的惩罚，而在这个问题上很难做到这一点。因此，我们应该对妇女施加什么限制，以抵消她们对不忠的强烈诱惑？似乎没有什么约束可言，只有对坏名声或声誉的惩罚；这种惩罚对人的心灵有很大的影响，同时也是世界上根据猜测、推测和证据而施加的，在任何法庭上都不会被接受。因此，为了对女性施加适当的约束，我们必须对她们的不忠行为给予特殊程度的羞辱，而不是仅仅因为其不公正而产生的羞辱，并且必须对她们的贞洁给予相应的赞美。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this be a very strong motive to fidelity, our philosopher wou'd quickly discover, that it wou'd not alone be sufficient to that purpose. All human creatures, especially of the female sex, are apt to over-look remote motives in favour of any present temptation: The temptation is here the strongest imaginable: Its approaches are insensible and seducing: And a woman easily finds, or flatters herself she shall find, certain means of securing her reputation, and preventing all the pernicious consequences of her pleasures. 'Tis necessary, therefore, that, beside the infamy attending such licences, there shou'd be some preceding backwardness or dread, which may prevent their first approaches, and may give the female sex a repugnance to all expressions, and postures, and liberties, that have an immediate relation to that enjoyment.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管这是一个非常强烈的忠贞动机，我们的哲学家很快就会发现，仅凭这一点还不足以达到目的。所有的人，尤其是女性，都容易忽视遥远的动机，而倾向于任何当前的诱惑。这里的诱惑是可以想象的最强烈的。这里的诱惑是可以想象的最强烈的：它的接近是不可察觉的和诱人的。一个女人很容易找到，或者自以为是地找到某些手段来保证她的名誉，并防止她的快乐带来的所有恶果。因此，除了这种许可所带来的恶名外，还必须有一些先期的落后或恐惧，这可能会阻止它们的首次接近，并可能使女性对与这种享受有直接关系的所有言论、姿势和自由产生反感。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Such wou'd be the reasonings of our speculative philosopher: But I am persuaded, that if he had not a perfect knowledge of human nature, he wou'd be apt to regard them as mere chimerical speculations, and wou'd consider the infamy attending infidelity, and backwardness to all its approaches, as principles that were rather to be wish'd than hop'd for in the world. For what means, wou'd he say, of persuading mankind, that the transgressions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other kind of injustice, when 'tis evident they are more excusable, upon account of the greatness of the temptation? And what possibility of giving a backwardness to the approaches of a pleasure, to which nature has inspir'd so strong a propensity; and a propensity that 'tis absolutely necessary in the end to comply with, for the support of the species?</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">这就是我们的投机哲学家的推理。但我相信，如果他不是对人性有充分的了解，他就会把它们看作是纯粹的猜测，并认为不忠所带来的耻辱，以及对其所有方法的落后，是世界上宁可希望也不希望的原则。他说，有什么办法可以说服人类，说违背夫妻责任的行为比其他任何不公正的行为都更可耻，而显然，由于诱惑之大，这些行为是可以原谅的？还有，对于自然界已经激发出如此强烈的倾向性的快乐的接近，又有什么可能给予落后的态度呢？</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But speculative reasonings, which cost so much pains to philosophers, are often form'd by the world naturally, and without reflection: As difficulties, which seem insurmountable in theory, are easily got over in practice. Those, who have an interest in the fidelity of women, naturally disapprove of their infidelity, and all the approaches to it. Those, who have no interest, are carried along with the stream. Education takes possession of the ductile minds of the fair sex in their infancy. And when a general rule of this kind is once establish'd, men are apt to extend it beyond those principles, from which it first arose. Thus bachelors, however debauch'd, cannot chuse but be shock'd with any instance of lewdness or impudence in women. And tho' all these maxims have a plain reference to generation, yet women past child-bearing have no more privilege in this respect, than those who are in the flower of their youth and beauty. Men have undoubtedly an implicit notion, that all those ideas of modesty and decency have a regard to generation; since they impose not the same laws, with the same force, on the male sex, where that reason takes not place. The exception is there obvious and extensive, and founded on a remarkable difference, which produces a clear separation and disjunction of ideas. But as the case is not the same with regard to the different ages of women, for this reason, tho' men know, that these notions are founded on the public interest, yet the general rule carries us beyond the original principle, and makes us extend the notions of modesty over the whole sex, from their earliest infancy to their extremest old-age and infirmity.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，哲学家们费尽心机的推理，往往是由世界自然形成的，并没有经过思考。正如在理论上似乎无法克服的困难，在实践中却很容易克服。那些对妇女的忠诚有兴趣的人，自然不赞成她们的不忠，以及所有接近不忠的行为。那些没有兴趣的人，就会随波逐流了。教育在她们的幼年时期就占据了她们柔韧的心灵。当这种普遍的规则一旦确立，人们就会把它延伸到它最初产生的那些原则之外。因此，单身汉们，无论多么放荡不羁，都会被女人的任何淫荡或无耻的行为所震惊。尽管所有这些格言都是关于下一代的，但在这方面，已过了生育期的妇女并不比那些正处于青春和美丽期的妇女有更多的特权。男人们无疑有一种含蓄的观念，认为所有这些谦虚和得体的观念都考虑到了世代的问题；因为他们没有以同样的力量对男性施加同样的法律，而这种原因却不在其中。这种例外是明显而广泛的，是建立在一个显著的差异上的，这种差异产生了一种明显的分离和思想的不一致。但是，由于妇女的不同年龄，情况就不一样了，因为这个原因，虽然人们知道这些观念是建立在公共利益之上的，但是一般的规则使我们超越了原来的原则，使我们把谦虚的观念扩大到整个性别，从她们最早的婴儿期到她们最老和最虚弱的时候。</p></div>

But when along with this, the objects, that cause pleasure or pain, acquire a relation to ourselves or others; they still continue to excite desire and aversion, grief and joy: But cause, at the same time, the indirect passions of pride or humility, love or hatred, which in this case have a double relation of impressions and ideas to the pain or pleasure.</p>

The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations nor can any one be actuated by any affection, of which all others are not, in some degree, susceptible. As in strings equally wound up, the motion of one communicates itself to the rest; so all the affections readily pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in every human creature. When I see the <i class="calibre10">effects</i> of passion in the voice and gesture of any person, my mind immediately passes from these effects to their causes, and forms such a lively idea of the passion, as is presently converted into the passion itself. In like manner, when I perceive the <i class="calibre10">causes</i> of any emotion, my mind is convey'd to the effects, and is actuated with a like emotion. Were I present at any of the more terrible operations of surgery, 'tis certain, that even before it begun, the preparation of the instruments, the laying of the bandages in order, the heating of the irons, with all the signs of anxiety and concern in the patient and assistants, wou'd have a great effect upon my mind, and excite the strongest sentiments of pity and terror. No passion of another discovers itself immediately to the mind. We are only sensible of its causes or effects.

		<p class="block_6 en">Our sense of beauty depends very much on this principle; and where any object has a tendency to produce pleasure in its possessor, it is always regarded as beautiful; as every object, that has a tendency to produce pain, is disagreeable and deform'd. Thus the convenience of a house, the fertility of a field, the strength of a horse, the capacity, security, and swift-sailing of a vessel, form the principal beauty of these several objects. Here the object, which is denominated beautiful, pleases only by its tendency to produce a certain effect. That effect is the pleasure or advantage of some other person. Now the pleasure of a stranger, for whom we have no friendship, pleases us only by sympathy. To this principle, therefore, is owing the beauty, which we find in every thing that is useful. How considerable a part this is of beauty will easily appear upon reflection. Wherever an object has a tendency to produce pleasure in the possessor, or in other words, is the proper cause of pleasure, it is sure to please the spectator, by a delicate sympathy with the possessor. Most of the works of art are esteem'd beautiful, in proportion to their fitness for the use of man, and even many of the productions of nature derive their beauty from that source. Handsome and beautiful, on most occasions, is not an absolute but a relative quality, and pleases us by nothing but its tendency to produce an end that is agreeable<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-217" id="calibre_link-252" title="78">78</a></sup>.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们的美感在很大程度上取决于这一原则；当任何物体有在其拥有者身上产生快乐的趋势时，它总是被认为是美丽的；因为每一个有产生痛苦趋势的物体都是令人不快的和畸形的。因此，房屋的方便，田地的肥沃，马的力量，船只的容量、安全和快速航行，构成了这几种物体的主要美。在这里，被称为美丽的物体，只因其产生某种效果的趋势而令人高兴。这个效果就是其他一些人的快乐或好处。现在，一个陌生人的快乐，我们对他没有友谊，只是通过同情来取悦我们。因此，我们在每件有用的东西中发现的美，就是由于这个原则。仔细想想，这在美中占了多大的比重就不难发现。只要一件物品有在拥有者身上产生快乐的倾向，或者换句话说，是快乐的适当原因，它就一定会通过与拥有者的微妙同情来取悦观众。大多数艺术作品被认为是美丽的，与它们适合人类使用的程度成正比，甚至许多自然界的产品也从这个来源获得了它们的美丽。英俊和美丽，在大多数情况下，并不是一种绝对的，而是一种相对的品质，除了产生一种令人满意的结果的倾向外，并没有什么让我们高兴的地方。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-217" id="calibre_link-252" title="78">78</a></sup>.</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The same principle produces, in many instances, our sentiments of morals, as well as those of beauty. No virtue is more esteem'd than justice, and no vice more detested than injustice; nor are there any qualities, which go farther to the fixing the character, either as amiable or odious. Now justice is a moral virtue, merely because it has that tendency to the good of mankind; and, indeed, is nothing but an artificial invention to that purpose. The same may be said of allegiance, of the laws of nations, of modesty, and of good manners. All these are mere human contrivances for the interest of society. And since there is a very strong sentiment of morals, which in all nations, and all ages, has attended them, we must allow, that the reflecting on the tendency of characters and mental qualities, is sufficient to give us the sentiments of approbation and blame. Now as the means to an end can only be agreeable, where the end is agreeable; and as the good of society, where our own interest is not concern'd, or that of our friends, pleases only by sympathy: It follows, that sympathy is the source of the esteem, which we pay to all the artificial virtues.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在许多情况下，同样的原则产生了我们的道德情感，以及那些美丽的情感。没有哪种美德比正义更受推崇，没有哪种恶习比不公正更遭人厌恶；也没有哪种品质能更进一步地将人的性格固定为可亲或可憎的。现在，正义是一种道德美德，仅仅是因为它具有为人类造福的倾向；事实上，它只不过是为此目的的一种人为发明。效忠、国家的法律、谦虚和良好的礼仪也可以这样说。所有这些都只是人类为了社会利益而设计的。既然在所有国家和所有时代都有一种非常强烈的道德感，我们必须承认，对性格和心理素质的倾向进行反思，就足以让我们产生赞许和责备的情绪。现在，由于达到目的的手段只有在目的令人满意的情况下才会令人满意；由于在我们自己的利益和我们朋友的利益不受关注的情况下，社会的利益只有通过同情才会令人满意：因此，同情是我们对所有人造美德的尊重的来源。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus it appears, <i class="calibre10">that</i> sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature, <i class="calibre10">that</i> it has a great influence on our taste of beauty, and <i class="calibre10">that</i> it produces our sentiment of morals in all the artificial virtues. From thence we may presume, that it also gives rise to many of the other virtues; and that qualities acquire our approbation, because of their tendency to the good of mankind. This presumption must become a certainty, when we find that most of those qualities, which we <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> approve of, have actually that tendency, and render a man a proper member of society: While the qualities, which we <i class="calibre10">naturally</i> disapprove of, have a contrary tendency, and render any intercourse with the person dangerous or disagreeable. For having found, that such tendencies have force enough to produce the strongest sentiment of morals, we can never reasonably, in these cases, look for any other cause of approbation or blame; it being an inviolable maxim in philosophy, that where any particular cause is sufficient for an effect, we ought to rest satisfied with it, and ought not to multiply causes without necessity. We have happily attain'd experiments in the artificial virtues, where the tendency of qualities to the good of society, is the sole cause of our approbation, without any suspicion of the concurrence of another principle. From thence we learn the force of that principle.

		<p class="block_6 en">That many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good of society, no one can doubt of. Meekness, beneficence, charity, generosity, clemency, moderation, equity, bear the greatest figure among the moral qualities, and are commonly denominated the <i class="calibre10">social</i> virtues, to mark their tendency to the good of society. This goes so far, that some philosophers have represented all moral distinctions as the effect of artifice and education, when skilful politicians endeavour'd to retrain the turbulent passions of men, and make them operate to the public good, by the notions of honour and shame. This system, however, is not consistent with experience. For, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, there are other virtues and vices beside those which have this tendency to the public advantage and loss. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, had not men a natural sentiment of approbation and blame, it cou'd never be excited by politicians; nor wou'd the words <i class="calibre10">laudable</i> and <i class="calibre10">praise-worthy, blameable</i> and <i class="calibre10">odious</i>, be any more intelligible, than if they were a language perfectly unknown to us, as we have already observ'd. But tho' this system be erroneous, it may teach us, that moral distinctions arise, in a great measure, from the tendency of qualities and characters to the interests of society, and that 'tis our concern for that interest, which makes us approve or disapprove of them. Now we have no such extensive concern for society but from sympathy; and consequently 'tis that principle, which takes us so far out of ourselves, as to give us the same pleasure or uneasiness in the characters of others, as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or loss.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The only difference betwixt the natural virtues and justice lies in this, that the good, which results from the former, arises from every single act, and is the object of some natural passion: Whereas a single act of justice, consider'd in itself, may often be contrary to the public good; and 'tis only the concurrence of mankind, in a general scheme or system of action, which is advantageous. When I relieve persons in distress, my natural humanity is my motive; and so far as my succour extends, so far have I promoted the happiness of my fellow-creatures. But if we examine all the questions, that come before any tribunal of justice, we shall find, that, considering each case apart, it wou'd as often be an instance of humanity to decide contrary to the laws of justice as conformable to them. Judges take from a poor man to give to a rich; they bestow on the dissolute the labour of the industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means of harming both themselves and others. The whole scheme, however, of law and justice is advantageous to the society; and 'twas with a view to this advantage, that men, by their voluntary conventions, establish'd it.

		<p class="block_6 cn">自然美德和正义之间的唯一区别在于，前者所产生的善，来自于每一个单一的行为，并且是一些自然激情的对象。而单一的正义行为，就其本身而言，可能常常与公共利益相悖；只有人类在一个总的计划或行动体系中达成一致，才是有益的。当我救助处于困境的人时，我的自然人性是我的动机；我的救助范围有多大，我对我的同胞的幸福就有多大的促进。但是，如果我们审视任何司法法庭面前的所有问题，我们就会发现，单独考虑每一个案件，违背正义法则的裁决与符合正义法则的裁决一样，都会成为人性的实例。法官们取之于贫，用之于富；他们把勤劳的人的劳动给予放荡不羁的人；把伤害自己和他人的手段交到邪恶的人手中。然而，法律和正义的整个计划对社会是有利的；人们正是为了这个好处，才通过他们的自愿公约建立了它。一旦它被这些惯例所确立，它<i class="calibre10">自然</i>会伴随着一种强烈的道德感；这种道德感除了来自于我们对社会利益的同情之外，别无其他。我们不需要对这种尊重进行其他解释，这种尊重伴随着那些倾向于公共利益的自然美德。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I must farther add, that there are several circumstances, which render this hypothesis much more probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. 'Tis certain, that the imagination is more affected by what is particular, than by what is general; and that the sentiments are always mov'd with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loose and undetermin'd: Now every particular act of justice is not beneficial to society, but the whole scheme or system: And it may not, perhaps, be any individual person, for whom we are concern'd, who receives benefit from justice, but the whole society alike. On the contrary, every particular act of generosity, or relief of the industrious and indigent, is beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular person, who is not undeserving of it. 'Tis more natural, therefore, to think, that the tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our sentiments, and command our approbation, than those of the former; and therefore, since we find, that the approbation of the former arises from their tendencies, we may ascribe, with better reason, the same cause to the approbation of the latter. In any number of similar effects, if a cause can be discover'd for one, we ought to extend that cause to all the other effects. which can be accounted for by it: But much more, if these other effects be attended with peculiar circumstances, which facilitate the operation of that cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我还必须补充说，有几种情况使这种假设在自然美德方面比在人工美德方面更有可能。可以肯定的是，想象力受特殊事物的影响比受一般事物的影响要大；当他们的目标在任何程度上是松散和不确定的时候，情感总是会被困难地调动起来。现在，每一个特定的正义行为都不是对社会有益的，而是对整个计划或系统有益的。而且，我们所关心的可能不是任何个人从正义中得到好处，而是整个社会都一样。相反，每一个特定的慷慨行为，或对勤劳和贫穷的人的救济，都是有益的；而且对一个特定的人是有益的，他并不是不应该得到它。因此，我们更自然地认为，后一种美德的倾向会比前一种美德的倾向影响我们的情绪，并得到我们的赞许；因此，既然我们发现前一种美德的赞许源于它们的倾向，我们就可以更合理地把同样的原因归结为对后一种美德的赞许。在任何数量的类似效果中，如果能发现一个原因，我们就应该把这个原因扩大到所有其他的效果，而这些效果都可以由它来解释。但是，如果这些其他效果有特殊的情况，有利于该原因的运作，那就更应该如此。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Before I proceed farther, I must observe two remarkable circumstances in this affair, which may seem objections to the present system. The first may be thus explain'd. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind, we are pleas'd with it, and approve of it; because it presents the lively idea of pleasure; which idea affects us by sympathy, and is itself a kind of pleasure. But as this sympathy is very variable, it may be thought, that our sentiments of morals must admit of all the same variations. We sympathize more with persons contiguous to us, than with persons remote from us: With our acquaintance, than with strangers: With our countrymen, than with foreigners. But notwithstanding this variation of our sympathy, we give the same approbation to the same moral qualities in <i class="calibre10">China</i> as in <i class="calibre10">England</i>. They appear equally virtuous, and recommend themselves equally to the esteem of a judicious spectator. The sympathy varies without a variation in our esteem. Our esteem, therefore, proceeds not from sympathy.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我继续前进之前，我必须注意到这件事中两个显著的情况，它们似乎是对目前制度的反对意见。第一个情况可以这样解释。当任何品质或性格都有为人类造福的倾向时，我们会对它感到高兴，并赞同它；因为它提出了生动的快乐理念；这种理念通过同情影响我们，本身就是一种快乐。但是，由于这种同情心是非常多变的，因此可以认为，我们的道德情感必须接受所有同样的变化。我们对与我们相邻的人的同情，比对与我们相距遥远的人的同情更多。与我们的熟人相比，与陌生人相比。与我们的同胞相比，与外国人相比。但是，尽管我们的同情心有这种变化，我们对<i class="calibre10">中国</i>和<i class="calibre10">英国</i>的相同道德品质还是给予了同样的赞许。他们看起来同样有德行，同样能得到明智的观众的尊重。同情的变化并不影响我们的尊重。因此，我们的敬意不是来自于同情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To this I answer: The approbation of moral qualities most certainly is not deriv'd from reason, or any comparison of ideas; but proceeds entirely from a moral taste, and from certain sentiments of pleasure or disgust, which arise upon the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters. Now 'tis evident, that those sentiments, whence-ever they are deriv'd, must vary according to the distance or contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the same lively pleasure from the virtues of a person, who liv'd in <i class="calibre10">Greece</i> two thousand years ago, that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance. Yet I do not say, that I esteem the one more than the other: And therefore, if the variation of the sentiment, without a variation of the esteem, be an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as against that of sympathy. But to consider the matter a-right, it has no force at all; and 'tis the easiest matter in the world to account for it. Our situation, with regard both to persons and things, is in continual fluctuation; and a man, that lies at a distance from us, may, in a little time, become a familiar acquaintance. Besides, every particular man has a peculiar position with regard to others; and 'tis impossible we cou'd ever converse together on any reasonable terms, were each of us to consider characters and persons, only as they appear from his peculiar point of view. In order, therefore, to prevent those continual <i class="calibre10">contradictions</i>, and arrive at a more <i class="calibre10">stable</i> judgment of things, we fix on some <i class="calibre10">steady</i> and <i class="calibre10">general</i> points of view; and always, in our thoughts, place ourselves in them, whatever may be our present situation. In like manner, external beauty is determin'd merely by pleasure; and 'tis evident, a beautiful countenance cannot give so much pleasure, when seen at the distance of twenty paces, as when it is brought nearer us. We say not, however, that it appears to us less beautiful: Because we know what effect it will have in such a position, and by that reflection we correct its momentary appearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">对此，我回答说。对道德品质的赞许肯定不是来自于理性，也不是来自于任何观念的比较；而是完全来自于道德的品味，来自于某些快乐或厌恶的情绪，这些情绪是在思考和观看特定的品质或人物时产生的。现在很明显的是，这些情绪，无论它们从何而来，都必须根据对象的远近而变化；我也不可能从一个两千年前生活在<i class="calibre10">希腊</i>的人的美德中感受到同样生动的快乐，就像我从一个熟悉的朋友和熟人的美德中感受到的那样。但我并不是说，我对一个人比另一个人更尊敬。因此，如果情感的变化，而没有敬意的变化，是一种反对意见，那么它对其他每一种体系的反对力度，与对同情的反对力度相同。但是，如果正确地考虑这个问题，它就没有任何力量；而且是世界上最容易解释的问题。我们对人和事的情况都是不断变化的；一个离我们很远的人，在很短的时间内就可能成为我们的熟人。此外，每个人对其他人都有一个特殊的位置；如果我们每个人都只考虑从他独特的角度来看的人物和人，那么我们就不可能在任何合理的条件下一起交谈。因此，为了防止这些持续的<i class="calibre10">矛盾</i>，并对事物有一个更<i class="calibre10">稳定的</i>判断，我们固定在一些<i class="calibre10">稳定</i>和<i class="calibre10">一般的</i>观点上；并且在我们的思想中，无论我们现在的情况如何，总是把自己放在这些观点上。同样，外在的美仅仅是由快乐决定的；很明显，一个美丽的面孔在20步远的地方看到时，不能给人如此多的快乐，因为它离我们更近。然而，我们并不是说它在我们看来不那么美。因为我们知道它在这样的位置上会有什么效果，通过这种思考，我们纠正了它一时的外观。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, all sentiments of blame or praise are variable, according to our situation of nearness or remoteness, with regard to the person blam'd or prais'd, and according to the present disposition of our mind. But these variations we regard not in our general decisions, but still apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike, in the same manner, as if we remain'd in one point of view. Experience soon teaches us this method of correcting our sentiments, or at least, of correcting our language, where the sentiments are more stubborn and inalterable. Our servant, if diligent and faithful, may excite stronger sentiments of love and kindness than <i class="calibre10">Marcus Brutus</i>, as represented in history; but we say not upon that account, that the former character is more laudable than the latter. We know, that were we to approach equally near to that renown'd patriot, he wou'd command a much higher degree of affection and admiration. Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses; and indeed 'twere impossible we cou'd ever make use of language, or communicate our sentiments to one another, did we not correct the momentary appearances of things, and overlook our present situation.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">一般来说，所有责备或赞美的情绪都是可变的，根据我们对被责备或被赞美的人的亲近或疏远的情况，以及根据我们目前的心态来决定。但在我们的一般决定中，我们不考虑这些变化，但仍然以同样的方式使用表达我们喜欢或不喜欢的术语，就像我们保持在一个观点上一样。经验很快就教会了我们这种纠正情绪的方法，或者至少是纠正我们的语言，在情绪比较顽固和不可改变的地方。我们的仆人，如果勤奋和忠诚，可能会比历史上的<i class="calibre10">马库斯-布鲁图斯</i>激起更强烈的爱和善良的情感；但我们不会因此说，前者的性格比后者更值得称赞。我们知道，如果我们同样接近那位著名的爱国者，他将会得到更多的爱戴和钦佩。这种修正对所有的感官来说都是常见的；事实上，如果我们不修正事物的瞬间表象，不忽视我们现在的处境，我们就不可能使用语言，也不可能相互交流我们的情感。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis therefore from the influence of characters and qualities, upon those who have an intercourse with any person, that we blame or praise him. We consider not whether the persons, affected by the qualities, be our acquaintance or strangers, countrymen or foreigners. Nay, we over-look our own interest in those general judgments; and blame not a man for opposing us in any of our pretensions, when his own interest is particularly concern'd. We make allowance for a certain degree of selfishness in men; because we know it to be inseparable from human nature, and inherent in our frame and constitution. By this reflection we correct those sentiments of blame, which so naturally arise upon any opposition.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，我们指责或赞美一个人，是由于他的性格和品质对那些与他有交往的人的影响。我们不考虑受这些品质影响的人，是我们的熟人还是陌生人，是同胞还是外国人。不，我们在这些一般性的判断中忽略了我们自己的利益；当一个人的利益受到特别关注时，他不会因为反对我们的任何主张而责备他。我们允许人有一定程度的自私；因为我们知道这是人类本性中不可分割的，是我们的框架和结构中固有的。通过这种反思，我们纠正了那些因任何反对意见而自然产生的责备情绪。</p></div>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But however the general principle of our blame or praise may be corrected by those other principles, 'tis certain, they are not altogether efficacious, nor do our passions often correspond entirely to the present theory. 'Tis seldom men heartily love what lies at a distance from them, and what no way redounds to their particular benefit; as 'tis no less rare to meet with persons, who can pardon another any opposition he makes to their interest, however justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality. Here we are contented with saying, that reason requires such an impartial conduct, but that 'tis seldom we can bring ourselves to it, and that our passions do not readily follow the determination of our judgment. This language will be easily understood, if we consider what we formerly said concerning that reason, which is able to oppose our passion; and which we have found to be nothing but a general calm determination of the passions, founded on some distant view or reflection. When we form our judgments of persons, merely from the tendency of their characters to our own benefit, or to that of our friends, we find so many contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation, and such an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation, that we seek some other standard of merit and demerit, which may not admit of so great variation. Being thus loosen'd from our first station, we cannot afterwards fix ourselves so commodiously by any means as by a sympathy with those, who have any commerce with the person we consider. This is far from being as lively as when our own interest is concern'd, or that of our particular friends; nor has it such an influence on our love and hatred: But being equally conformable to our calm and general principles, 'tis said to have an equal authority over our reason, and to command our judgment and opinion. We blame equally a bad action, which we read of in history, with one perform'd in our neighbourhood t'other day: The meaning of which is, that we know from reflection, that the former action wou'd excite as strong sentiments of disapprobation as the latter, were it plac'd in the same position.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，无论我们的责备或赞美的一般原则如何被这些其他原则所纠正，可以肯定的是，它们并不完全有效，我们的激情也常常完全符合目前的理论。很少有人会衷心爱护与他们相距甚远的东西，以及对他们没有任何好处的东西；同样，也很少有人会原谅他人对自己利益的反对，无论这种反对根据一般的道德规则是多么合理。在这里，我们只想说，理性需要这样一种公正的行为，但我们很少能做到这一点，而且我们的激情不容易跟随我们的判断力。如果我们考虑一下我们以前关于能够反对我们的激情的理性的说法，就会很容易理解这种语言；我们发现这种理性不过是激情的一般平静的决定，建立在一些遥远的观点或思考之上。当我们仅仅根据他们的性格对我们自己的利益或对我们的朋友的利益的倾向来形成我们对人的判断时，我们发现在社会和谈话中与我们的情感有如此多的矛盾，并且由于我们处境的不断变化而有如此大的不确定性，因此我们寻求一些其他的功过标准，这可能不允许有如此大的变化。这样一来，我们从最初的位置上松懈下来，以后就无法通过任何手段来固定自己，而只能通过与那些与我们所考虑的人有任何商业往来的人进行同情。这远不如我们自己的利益或我们特定的朋友的利益那样活跃；对我们的爱和恨也没有这样的影响。但由于同样符合我们的冷静和一般原则，可以说它对我们的理性有同样的权威，并指挥我们的判断和意见。我们对在历史上读到的一个坏行为和前几天在我们附近发生的一个坏行为进行同样的指责。这句话的意思是，我们通过思考知道，如果把前一个行为放在同样的位置上，它将会和后一个行为一样引起强烈的反对情绪。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">I now proceed to the <i class="calibre10">second</i> remarkable circumstance, which I propos'd to take notice of. Where a person is possess'd of a character, that in its natural tendency is beneficial to society, we esteem him virtuous, and are delighted with the view of his character, even tho' particular accidents prevent its operation, and incapacitate him from being serviceable to his friends and country. Virtue in rags is still virtue; and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or desart, where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lost to all the world. Now this may be esteem'd an objection to the present system. Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind; and if sympathy were the source of our esteem for virtue, that sentiment of approbation cou'd only take place, where the virtue actually attain'd its end, and was beneficial to mankind. Where it fails of its end, 'tis only an imperfect means; and therefore can never acquire any merit from that end. The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on such means alone as are compleat, and actually produce the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我现在开始讲<i class="calibre10">第二个</i>显著的情况，我建议注意这个情况。当一个人拥有一种自然倾向于对社会有益的品格时，我们就会认为他是有德行的，并对他的品格感到高兴，即使特定的事故阻碍了它的运作，并使他无法为朋友和国家服务。衣衫褴褛的美德仍然是美德；而它所带来的爱，却把一个人带进了地牢或沙漠，在那里，美德再也无法在行动中发挥出来，并被全世界所遗忘。现在，这可以被视为对现行制度的反对。如果同情心是我们尊重美德的源泉，那么只有在美德真正达到其目的，并对人类有益的情况下，才会出现这种赞许的情绪。如果它没有达到目的，它就只是一种不完美的手段；因此，它永远无法从目的中获得任何优点。一个目的的善意只能赋予那些完整的、实际产生目的的手段以功绩。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">To this we may reply, that where any object, in all its parts, is fitted to attain any agreeable end, it naturally gives us pleasure, and is esteem'd beautiful, even tho' some external circumstances be wanting to render it altogether effectual. 'Tis sufficient if every thing be compleat in the object itself. A house, that is contriv'd with great judgment for all the commodities of life, pleases us upon that account; tho' perhaps we are sensible, that no-one will ever dwell in it. A fertile soil, and a happy climate, delight us by a reflection on the happiness which they wou'd afford the inhabitants, tho' at present the country be desart and uninhabited. A man, whose limbs and shape promise strength and activity, is esteem'd handsome, tho' condemn'd to perpetual imprisonment. The imagination has a set of passions belonging to it, upon which our sentiments of beauty much depend. These passions are mov'd by degrees of liveliness and strength, which are inferior to <i class="calibre10">belief</i> and independent of the real existence of their objects. Where a character is, in every respect, fitted to be beneficial to society, the imagination passes easily from the cause to the effect, without considering that there are still some circumstances wanting to render the cause a compleat one. <i class="calibre10">General rules</i> create a species of probability, which sometimes influences the judgment, and always the imagination.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">对此，我们可以回答说，如果任何物体的所有部分都能达到任何令人满意的目的，它自然会给我们带来快乐，并被认为是美丽的，即使缺少一些外部条件来使它完全有效。如果物体本身的每一个部分都是完整的，这就足够了。一所房子，经过精心设计，可以容纳所有的生活用品，我们因此而感到高兴；尽管我们知道，没有人会住在里面。一片肥沃的土地，一个幸福的气候，使我们感到高兴，因为我们想到它们会给居民带来幸福，尽管目前这个国家是荒芜的，无人居住的。一个人，如果他的四肢和体形保证了他的力量和活动，那么他就会被认为是英俊的，尽管他被判处永远的监禁。想象力有一套属于它的激情，我们对美的感受主要依赖于此。这些激情是由活力和力量的程度来推动的，这比<i class="calibre10">信仰</i>要低，而且与它们的对象的真实存在无关。当一个人物在各方面都适合于对社会有益时，想象力就会轻易地从原因到结果，而不考虑还有一些情况需要使原因变得完整。<i class="calibre10">一般的规则</i>创造了一种可能性，它有时会影响判断力，而总是影响想象力。</p></div>

We know, that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent disposition entirely impotent; and therefore we separate, as much as possible, the fortune from the disposition. The case is the same, as when we correct the different sentiments of virtue, which proceed from its different distances from ourselves.

When a building seems clumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and disagreeable; tho' we be fully assur'd of the solidity of the workmanship.

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis very happy, in our philosophical researches, when we find the same phænomenon diversified by a variety of circumstances; and by discovering what is common among them, can the better assure ourselves of the truth of any hypothesis we may make use of to explain it. Were nothing esteem'd virtue but what were beneficial to society, I am persuaded, that the foregoing explication of the moral sense ought still to be receiv'd, and that upon sufficient evidence: But this evidence must grow upon us, when we find other kinds of virtue, which will not admit of any explication except from that hypothesis. Here is a man, who is not remarkably defective in his social qualities; but what principally recommends him is his dexterity in business, by which he has extricated himself from the greatest difficulties, and conducted the most delicate affairs with a singular address and prudence. I find an esteem for him immediately to arise in me: His company is a satisfaction to me; and before I have any farther acquaintance with him, I wou'd rather do him a service than another, whose character is in every other respect equal, but is deficient in that particular. In this case, the qualities that please me are all consider'd as useful to the person, and as having a tendency to promote his interest and satisfaction. They are only regarded as means to an end, and please me in proportion to their fitness for that end. The end, therefore, must be agreeable to me. But what makes the end agreeable? The person is a stranger: I am no way interested in him, nor lie under any obligation to him: His happiness concerns not me, farther than the happiness of every human, and indeed of every sensible creature: That is, it affects me only by sympathy. From that principle, whenever I discover his happiness and good, whether in its causes or effects, I enter so deeply into it, that it gives me a sensible emotion. The appearance of qualities, that have a <i class="calibre10">tendency</i> to promote it, have an agreeable effect upon my imagination, and command my love and esteem.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在我们的哲学研究中，当我们发现同一现象因各种情况而不同时，这是非常令人高兴的；通过发现其中的共同点，可以更好地保证我们可能用来解释它的任何假设的真实性。如果除了对社会有益之外，没有任何东西被视为美德，我相信，上述对道德感的解释仍然应该被接受，而且是在充分的证据下。但是，当我们发现其他类型的美德时，这种证据必须在我们身上得到加强，因为除了这种假设之外，这些美德不可能得到任何解释。这里有一个人，他在社会素质方面没有明显的缺陷；但他最值得推荐的是他在商业方面的灵巧，通过这种灵巧，他把自己从最大的困难中解救出来，并以一种奇特的态度和谨慎处理最棘手的事务。我发现我立刻对他产生了敬佩之情。他的公司让我很满意；在我与他有进一步的认识之前，我宁愿为他服务，而不是为另一个人服务，因为后者的性格在其他方面都是一样的，但在那个方面却有缺陷。在这种情况下，使我满意的品质都被认为是对这个人有用的，并且有促进他的利益和满意的趋势。它们只是被视为达到某种目的的手段，并根据它们对该目的的适合程度来取悦我。因此，目的必须是对我有利的。但是，是什么使这个目的令人满意呢？这个人是个陌生人：我对他没有任何兴趣，也没有对他承担任何义务。他的幸福与我无关，远远超过每一个人的幸福，甚至是每一个可感知的生物的幸福。也就是说，它只通过同情心影响我。从这一原则出发，每当我发现他的幸福和美好，无论是在其原因还是效果上，我都会深深地进入其中，以至于它给我带来一种感性的情感。那些有促进作用<i class="calibre10">的</i>品质的出现，对我的想象力有很好的影响，并得到我的爱和敬重。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">This theory may serve to explain, why the same qualities, in all cases, produce both pride and love, humility and hatred; and the same man is always virtuous or vicious, accomplish'd or despicable to others, who is so to himself. A person, in whom we discover any passion or habit, which originally is only incommodious to himself, becomes always disagreeable to us, merely on its account; as on the other hand, one whose character is only dangerous and disagreeable to others, can never be satisfied with himself, as long as he is sensible of that disadvantage. Nor is this observable only with regard to characters and manners, but may be remark'd even in the most minute circumstances. A violent cough in another gives us uneasiness; tho' in itself it does not in the least affect us. A man will be mortified, if you tell him he has a stinking breath; tho' 'tis evidently no annoyance to himself. Our fancy easily changes its situation; and either surveying ourselves as we appear to others, or considering others as they feel themselves, we enter, by that means, into sentiments, which no way belong to us, and in which nothing but sympathy is able to interest us. And this sympathy we sometimes carry so far, as even to be displeas'd with a quality commodious to us, merely because it displeases others, and makes us disagreeable in their eyes; tho' perhaps we never can have any interest in rendering ourselves agreeable to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这个理论可以解释，为什么同样的品质在任何情况下都会产生骄傲和爱，谦卑和憎恨；同一个人在别人眼里总是美德或恶毒，成就或卑鄙，而他自己也是如此。一个人，如果我们在他身上发现了任何激情或习惯，而这些激情或习惯原本只是对他自己不合适，那么仅仅因为它的原因，他就总是让我们不满意；另一方面，一个人的性格如果只是对别人危险和不满意，那么只要他意识到这种缺点，就永远不会对自己满意。这也不是只在性格和举止方面可以观察到的，甚至在最细微的情况下也可以注意到。另一个人的剧烈咳嗽让我们感到不安，尽管它本身对我们没有丝毫影响。如果你告诉一个人他有一口臭气，他就会感到羞愧；尽管这显然不会对他自己造成任何困扰。我们的想象力很容易改变它的状况；要么按照我们在别人眼里的样子来观察自己，要么按照别人的感觉来考虑别人，通过这种方式，我们进入了不属于我们的情感，除了同情，没有什么能让我们感兴趣。这种同情有时会发展到如此地步，甚至会对我们所喜欢的品质感到不满，仅仅是因为它使别人不高兴，使我们在他们眼里不受欢迎；尽管我们也许从来没有兴趣使自己为他们所喜欢。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">There have been many systems of morality advanc'd by philosophers in all ages; but if they are strictly examin'd, they may be reduc'd to two, which alone merit our attention. Moral good and evil are certainly distinguish'd by our <i class="calibre10">sentiments</i>, not by <i class="calibre10">reason</i>: But these sentiments may arise either from the mere species or appearance of characters and passions, or from reflections on their tendency to the happiness of mankind, and of particular persons. My opinion is, that both these causes are intermix'd in our judgments of morals; after the same manner as they are in our decisions concerning most kinds of external beauty: Tho' I am also of opinion, that reductions on the tendencies of actions have by far the greatest influence, and determine all the great lines of our duty. There are, however, instances, in cases of less moment, wherein this immediate taste or sentiment produces our approbation. Wit, and a certain easy and disengag'd behaviour, are qualities <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to others, and command their love and esteem. Some of these qualities produce satisfaction in others by particular <i class="calibre10">original</i> principles of human nature, which cannot be accounted for: Others may be resolv'd into principles, which are more general. This will best appear upon a particular enquiry.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">古往今来，哲学家们提出了许多道德体系；但如果对它们进行严格审查，可以将它们缩减为两个，只有这两个值得我们注意。道德上的善与恶当然是由我们的<i class="calibre10">情感</i>来区分的，而不是由<i class="calibre10">理性</i>来区分的：但这些情感可能来自于性格和激情的单纯种类或外观，或者来自于对它们对人类和特定人的幸福的倾向的思考。我的看法是，这两种原因在我们的道德判断中是混合在一起的；就像它们在我们关于大多数种类的外在美的决定中是一样的方式。但我也认为，对行为的倾向性的判断到目前为止影响最大，并决定了我们责任的所有重要方面。然而，在一些不太重要的情况下，这种直接的品味或情感会产生我们的认可。聪明，以及某种轻松和脱离现实的行为，都是别人<i class="calibre10">立即喜欢的</i>品质，并得到他们的喜爱和尊重。这些品质中，有些是通过人性中特定的<i class="calibre10">原始</i>原则在他人身上产生满足感，这是无法解释的。另一些则可以被分解为更普遍的原则。这一点在具体的调查中最能体现出来。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As some qualities acquire their merit from their being <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to others, without any tendency to public interest; so some are denominated virtuous from their being <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to the person himself, who possesses them. Each of the passions and operations of the mind has a particular feeling, which must be either agreeable or disagreeable. The first is virtuous, the second vicious. This particular feeling constitutes the very nature of the passion; and therefore needs not be accounted for.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">正如有些品质因其<i class="calibre10">立即</i>为他人所喜爱而获得其优点，而没有任何公共利益的倾向；所以有些品质因其<i class="calibre10">立即</i>为拥有它们的人自己所喜爱而被称为美德。心灵的每一种激情和行动都有一种特殊的感觉，它必须是令人满意的或令人不满意的。前者是良性的，后者是恶性的。这种特殊的感觉构成了激情的本质；因此不需要解释。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But however directly the distinction of vice and virtue may seem to flow from the immediate pleasure or uneasiness, which particular qualities cause to ourselves or others; 'tis easy to observe, that it has also a considerable dependence on the principle of <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i> so often insisted on. We approve of a person, who is possess'd of qualities <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to those, with whom he has any commerce; tho' perhaps we ourselves never reap'd any pleasure from them. We also approve of one, who is possess'd of qualities, that are <i class="calibre10">immediately agreeable</i> to himself; tho' they be of no service to any mortal. To account for this we must have recourse to the foregoing principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，无论恶习和美德的区别是如何直接来自于特定品质给我们自己或他人带来的直接快乐或不快；我们很容易发现，它也相当依赖于经常坚持的<i class="calibre10">同情</i>原则。我们赞同一个人，他拥有那些与他有任何商业往来的人<i class="calibre10">立即喜欢的</i>品质；尽管我们自己可能从未从中获得任何快乐。我们也认可一个人，他拥有的品质对他自己来说是很<i class="calibre10">好</i>的，尽管这些品质对任何凡人都没有用。为了说明这一点，我们必须求助于前述原则。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thus, to take a general review of the present hypothesis: Every quality of the mind is denominated virtuous, which gives pleasure by the mere survey; as every quality, which produces pain, is call'd vicious. This pleasure and this pain may arise from four different sources. For we reap a pleasure from the view of a character, which is naturally fitted to be useful to others, or to the person himself, or which is agreeable to others, or to the person himself. One may, perhaps, be surpriz'd, that amidst all these interests and pleasures, we shou'd forget our own, which touch us so nearly on every other occasion. But we shall easily satisfy ourselves on this head, when we consider, that every particular person's pleasure and interest being different, 'tis impossible men cou'd ever agree in their sentiments and judgments, unless they chose some common point of view, from which they might survey their object, and which might cause it to appear the same to all of them. Now, in judging of characters, the only interest or pleasure, which appears the same to every spectator, is that of the person himself, whose character is examin'd; or that of persons, who have a connexion with him. And tho' such interests and pleasures touch us more faintly than our own, yet being more constant and universal, they counter-ballance the latter even in practice, and are alone admitted in speculation as the standard of virtue and morality. They alone produce that particular feeling or sentiment, on which moral distinctions depend.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，要对目前的假设进行总体回顾。心灵的每一种品质都被称为美德，它仅通过调查就能带来快乐；正如每一种品质，如果产生痛苦，就被称为恶毒。这种快乐和这种痛苦可能来自四个不同的来源。因为我们从对一个角色的观察中获得了快乐，这个角色自然适合于对他人或对自己有用，或者对他人或对自己有好处。也许有人会感到惊讶，在所有这些利益和快乐中，我们会忘记自己的利益和快乐，而这些利益和快乐在其他场合几乎都会触动我们。但是，当我们考虑到每个人的快乐和兴趣都不一样时，我们就会对这个问题感到满意，因为人们不可能在情感和判断上达成一致，除非他们选择一些共同的观点，从这些观点来观察他们的目标，并使其在他们所有人看来都一样。现在，在对人物进行评判时，对每个观众来说唯一相同的兴趣或乐趣，就是对其性格进行审查的人本身，或与他有联系的人。尽管这种兴趣和乐趣对我们的触动比我们自己的更微弱，但由于它们更加恒定和普遍，它们甚至在实践中也能与后者抗衡，而且只有在推测中才被承认为美德和道德的标准。只有它们才会产生那种特殊的感觉或情感，而道德上的区别就取决于此。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">As to the good or ill desert of virtue or vice, 'tis an evident consequence of the sentiments of pleasure or uneasiness. These sentiments produce love or hatred; and love or hatred, by the original constitution of human passion, is attended with benevolence or anger; that is, with a desire of making happy the person we love, and miserable the person we hate. We have treated of this more fully on another occasion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">至于美德或恶习的好坏，是快乐或不安的情绪的明显后果。这些情绪产生了爱或恨；而爱或恨，根据人类激情的原始结构，伴随着仁慈或愤怒；也就是说，伴随着让我们所爱的人幸福，让我们所恨的人痛苦的愿望。我们已经在另一个场合更充分地讨论了这个问题。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">It may now be proper to illustrate this general system of morals, by applying it to particular instances of virtue and vice, and shewing how their merit or demerit arises from the four sources here explain'd. We shall begin with examining the passions of <i class="calibre10">pride</i> and <i class="calibre10">humility</i>, and shall consider the vice or virtue that lies in their excesses or just proportion. An excessive pride or over-weaning conceit of ourselves is always esteem'd vicious, and is universally hated; as modesty, or a just sense of our weakness, is esteem'd virtuous, and procures the good-will of every-one. Of the four sources of moral distinctions, this is to be ascrib'd to the <i class="calibre10">third</i>; viz. the immediate agreeableness and disagreeableness of a quality to others, without any reflections on the tendency of that quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">现在，我们可以通过将其应用于美德和恶习的具体实例来说明这个一般的道德体系，并说明其优点或缺点是如何从这里解释的四个来源中产生的。我们将从审查<i class="calibre10">骄傲</i>和<i class="calibre10">谦卑</i>的激情开始，并将考虑其过度或适当的比例所带来的罪恶或美德。过度的骄傲或对自己的过度自负总是被认为是邪恶的，并且被普遍厌恶；而谦虚，或对自己的弱点有正确的认识，则被认为是美德，并能获得所有人的善意。在道德区别的四个来源中，这应归于<i class="calibre10">第三种</i>；即一种品质对他人的直接认同和不认同，而不需要对该品质的倾向进行任何思考。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">In order to prove this, we must have recourse to two principles, which are very conspicuous in human nature. The <i class="calibre10">first</i> of these is the <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>, and communication of sentiments and passions above-mention'd. So close and intimate is the correspondence of human souls, that no sooner any person approaches me, than he diffuses on me all his opinions, and draws along my judgment in a greater or lesser degree. And tho', on many occasions, my sympathy with him goes not so far as entirely to change my sentiments, and way of thinking; yet it seldom is so weak as not to disturb the easy course of my thought, and give an authority to that opinion, which is recommended to me by his assent and approbation. Nor is it any way material upon what subject he and I employ our thoughts. Whether we judge of an indifferent person, or of my own character, my sympathy gives equal force to his decision: And even his sentiments of his own merit make me consider him in the same light, in which he regards himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">为了证明这一点，我们必须求助于两个原则，这两个原则在人性中是非常明显的。<i class="calibre10">第一条</i>是上文提到的情感和激情的<i class="calibre10">共鸣</i>和交流。人的灵魂是如此的紧密和亲密，任何一个人一接近我，他就会向我传播他所有的观点，并或多或少地影响我的判断。尽管在许多情况下，我对他的同情并没有达到完全改变我的情绪和思维方式的程度；但这种同情很少会弱到不扰乱我轻松的思维过程，并为他的同意和赞许推荐给我的观点提供权威。他和我在什么问题上运用我们的思想也不重要。无论我们是评判一个无所谓的人，还是评判我自己的性格，我的同情心都会给他的决定带来同样的力量。甚至他对自己的功绩的看法，也使我从他看待自己的同样角度来考虑他。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This principle of sympathy is of so powerful and insinuating a nature, that it enters into most of our sentiments and passions, and often takes place under the appearance of its contrary. For 'tis remarkable, that when a person opposes me in any thing, which I am strongly bent upon, and rouzes up my passion by contradiction, I have always a degree of sympathy with him, nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin. We may here observe an evident conflict or encounter of opposite principles and passions. On the one side there is that passion or sentiment, which is natural to me; and 'tis observable, that the stronger this passion is, the greater is the commotion. There must also be some passion or sentiment on the other side; and this passion can proceed from nothing but sympathy. The sentiments of others can never affect us, but by becoming, in some measure, our own; in which case they operate upon us, by opposing and encreasing our passions, in the very same manner, as if they had been originally deriv'd from our own temper and disposition. While they remain conceal'd in the minds of others, they can never have any influence upon us: And even when they are known, if they went no farther than the imagination, or conception; that faculty is so accustom'd to objects of every different kind, that a mere idea, tho' contrary to our sentiments and inclinations, wou'd never alone be able to affect us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这种同情的原则具有如此强大和含蓄的性质，以至于它进入了我们大多数的情感和激情，并经常在其相反的外表下发生。因为值得注意的是，当一个人在任何事情上反对我，而我又强烈地想做这件事，并通过反驳激起我的激情时，我总是对他有一定程度的同情，我的骚动也不是从其他方面产生的。在这里，我们可以看到一个明显的冲突或相反的原则和激情的交锋。一边是对我来说很自然的激情或情感；可以看到，这种激情越强烈，骚动就越大。另一边也必须有一些激情或情绪；而这种激情除了同情之外，什么都不能产生。别人的情绪永远不会影响我们，除非在某种程度上成为我们自己的情绪；在这种情况下，它们通过反对和增加我们的激情，以同样的方式作用于我们，就像它们最初来自我们自己的脾气和性情。当它们仍然隐藏在别人的头脑中时，它们永远不会对我们产生任何影响。即使它们被知道了，如果它们不超过想象力或概念；这种能力是如此习惯于各种不同的对象，以至于一个单纯的想法，尽管与我们的情感和倾向相反，也永远无法单独影响我们。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">The <i class="calibre10">second</i> principle I shall take notice of is that of <i class="calibre10">comparison</i>, or the variation of our judgments concerning objects, according to the proportion they bear to those with which we compare them. We judge more of objects by comparison, than by their intrinsic worth and value; and regard every thing as mean, when set in opposition to what is superior of the same kind. But no comparison is more obvious than that with ourselves; and hence it is that on all occasions it takes place, and mixes with most of our passions. This kind of comparison is directly contrary to sympathy in its operation, as we have observ'd in treating of <i class="calibre10">compassion</i> and <i class="calibre10">malice</i>. <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-284" id="calibre_link-313" title="79">79</a></sup><i class="calibre10">In all kinds of comparison an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a sensation contrary to what arises from itself in its direct and immediate survey. The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure; and therefore produces pain, when compar'd with our own. His pain consider'd in itself, is painful; but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我将注意到的<i class="calibre10">第二个</i>原则是<i class="calibre10">比较</i>，或者说，我们对物体的判断的变化，是根据它们与我们所比较的物体的比例来决定的。我们对物体的判断更多的是通过比较，而不是通过其内在的价值；当每件东西与同类中更优秀的东西相对立时，我们就认为它是卑微的。但最明显的比较莫过于与我们自己的比较；因此，它在所有场合都会发生，并与我们的大多数激情混合在一起。这种比较在其作用上与同情心直接相反，正如我们在处理<i class="calibre10">同情心</i>和<i class="calibre10">恶意</i>时观察到的那样。 <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-284" id="calibre_link-313" title="79">79</a></sup><i class="calibre10">在所有类型的比较中，一个对象总是让我们从它所比较的另一个对象那里得到一种感觉，这种感觉与它在直接和直接观察中产生的感觉相反。直接观察他人的快乐，自然会给我们带来快乐；因此，当与我们自己的快乐相比较时，就会产生痛苦。他的痛苦就其本身而言是痛苦的；但却增强了我们自己的幸福感，并给我们带来快乐。</i></p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Since then those principles of sympathy, and a comparison with ourselves, are directly contrary, it may be worth while to consider, what general rules can be form'd, beside the particular temper of the person, for the prevalence of the one or the other. Suppose I am now in safety at land, and wou'd willingly reap some pleasure from this consideration: I must think on the miserable condition of those who are at sea in a storm, and must endeavour to render this idea as strong and lively as possible, in order to make me more sensible of my own happiness. But whatever pains I may take, the comparison will never have an equal efficacy, as if I were really on<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-285" id="calibre_link-370" title="80">80</a></sup> the shore, and saw a ship at a distance, tost by a tempest, and in danger every moment of perishing on a rock or sand-bank. But suppose this idea to become still more lively. Suppose the ship to be driven so near me, that I can perceive distinctly the horror, painted on the countenance of the seamen and passengers, hear their lamentable cries, see the dearest friends give their last adieu, or embrace with a resolution to perish in each others arms: No man has so savage a heart as to reap any pleasure from such a spectacle, or withstand the motions of the tenderest compassion and sympathy. 'Tis evident, therefore, there is a medium in this case; and that if the idea be too feint, it has no influence by comparison; and on the other hand, if it be too strong, it operates on us entirely by sympathy, which is the contrary to comparison. Sympathy being the conversion of an idea into an impression, demands a greater force and vivacity in the idea than is requisite to comparison.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">既然这些同情的原则和与我们自己的比较是直接相反的，那么就值得考虑一下，除了人的特殊脾气之外，还可以形成什么样的一般规则，以利于这一种或那一种的盛行。假设我现在在陆地上很安全，并且愿意从这种考虑中获得一些乐趣。我必须想到那些在暴风雨中在海上的人的悲惨处境，必须努力使这种想法尽可能地强烈和生动，以便使我更清楚地认识到自己的幸福。但是，无论我怎么努力，这种比较都不会有同等的效果，就像我真的在岸上，看到一艘船。<sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-285" id="calibre_link-370" title="80">80</a></sup>岸上，看到一艘船在远处被暴风雨袭击，而且每时每刻都有在岩石或沙岸上丧生的危险。但假设这个想法变得更加生动。假设这艘船离我如此之近，我可以清楚地看到海员和乘客脸上的惊恐，听到他们可悲的哭声，看到最亲爱的朋友发出最后的告别，或者拥抱在一起，决心在对方的怀抱中死去。没有人有如此野蛮的心，能从这样的景象中获得任何快乐，或承受最温柔的怜悯和同情的感动。因此，很明显，在这种情况下有一个媒介；如果这个想法太虚伪，它就不会通过比较产生影响；另一方面，如果它太强烈，它就会完全通过同情来影响我们，这与比较相反。同情是将思想转化为印象的过程，它要求思想具有比比较所需的更大的力量和活力。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">All this is easily applied to the present subject. We sink very much in our own eyes, when in the presence of a great man, or one of a superior genius; and this humility makes a considerable ingredient in that <i class="calibre10">respect</i>, which we pay our superiors, according to our <sup class="calibre11"><a class="noteref" href="#calibre_link-286" id="calibre_link-434" title="81">81</a></sup>foregoing reasonings on that passion. Sometimes even envy and hatred arise from the comparison; but in the greatest part of men, it rests at respect and esteem. As sympathy has such a powerful influence on the human mind, it causes pride to have, in some measure, the same effect as merit; and by making us enter into those elevated sentiments, which the proud man entertains of himself, presents that comparison, which is so mortifying and disagreeable. Our judgment does not entirely accompany him in the flattering conceit, in which he pleases himself; but still is so shaken as to receive the idea it presents, and to give it an influence above the loose conceptions of the imagination. A man, who, in an idle humour, wou'd form a notion of a person of a merit very much superior to his own, wou'd not be mortified by that fiction: But when a man, whom we are really persuaded to be of inferior merit, is presented to us; if we observe in him any extraordinary degree of pride and self-conceit; the firm persuasion he has of his own merit, takes hold of the imagination, and diminishes us in our own eyes, in the same manner, as if he were really possess'd of all the good qualities which he so liberally attributes to himself. Our idea is here precisely in that medium, which is requisite to make it operate on us by comparison. Were it accompanied with belief, and did the person appear to have the same merit, which he assumes to himself, it wou'd have a contrary effect, and wou'd operate on us by sympathy. The influence of that principle wou'd then be superior to that of comparison, contrary to what happens where the person's merit seems below his pretensions.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">The necessary consequence of these principles is, that pride, or an over-weaning conceit of ourselves, must be vicious; since it causes uneasiness in all men, and presents them every moment with a disagreeable comparison. 'Tis a trite observation in philosophy, and even in common life and conversation, that 'tis our own pride, which makes us so much displeas'd with the pride of other people; and that vanity becomes insupportable to us merely because we are vain. The gay naturally associate themselves with the gay, and the amorous with the amorous: But the proud never can endure the proud, and rather seek the company of those who are of an opposite disposition. As we are, all of us, proud in some degree, pride is universally blam'd and condemn'd by all mankind; as having a natural tendency to cause uneasiness in others by means of comparison. And this effect must follow the more naturally, that those, who have an ill-grounded conceit of themselves, are for ever making those comparisons, nor have they any other method of supporting their vanity. A man of sense and merit is pleas'd with himself, independent of all foreign considerations: But a fool must always find some person, that is more foolish, in order to keep himself in good humour with his own parts and understanding.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">这些原则的必然结果是，骄傲，或对自己的过度自负，一定是恶毒的；因为它使所有人都感到不安，并且每时每刻都给他们带来令人不快的比较。在哲学中，甚至在普通的生活和谈话中，都有一个老生常谈的观点："是我们自己的骄傲，让我们对其他人的骄傲如此不满；虚荣心变得让我们无法忍受，仅仅是因为我们是虚荣的。同性恋者自然与同性恋者交往，多情者与多情者交往：但骄傲的人永远无法忍受骄傲的人，而是寻求与那些性格相反的人为伍。由于我们每个人都有某种程度的骄傲，骄傲被全人类普遍指责和谴责；因为它有一种自然的倾向，通过比较而使他人感到不安。而这种影响必须更自然地产生，因为那些对自己的自负毫无根据的人，总是在进行这些比较，他们也没有任何其他方法来支持他们的虚荣心。一个有理智、有能力的人对自己很满意，不受任何外来因素影响。但一个傻子总要找到一些更傻的人，以使自己对自己的部分和理解保持良好的心态。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' an over-weaning conceit of our own merit be vicious and disagreeable, nothing can be more laudable, than to have a value for ourselves, where we really have qualities that are valuable. The utility and advantage of any quality to ourselves is a source of virtue, as well as its agreeableness to others; and 'tis certain, that nothing is more useful to us in the conduct of life, than a due degree of pride, which makes us sensible of our own merit, and gives us a confidence and assurance in all our projects and enterprizes. Whatever capacity any one may be endow'd with, 'tis entirely useless to him, if he be not acquainted with it, and form not designs suitable to it. 'Tis requisite on all occasions to know our own force; and were it allowable to err on either side, 'twou'd be more advantageous to overrate our merit, than to form ideas of it, below its just standard. Fortune commonly favours the bold and enterprizing; and nothing inspires us with more boldness than a good opinion of ourselves.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus self-satisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable, but requisite in a character. 'Tis, however, certain, that good-breeding and decency require that we shou'd avoid all signs and expressions, which tend directly to show that passion. We have, all of us, a wonderful partiality for ourselves, and were we always to give vent to our sentiments in this particular, we shou'd mutually cause the greatest indignation in each other, not only by the immediate presence of so disagreeable a subject of comparison, but also by the contrariety of our judgments. In like manner, therefore, as we establish the <i class="calibre10">law of nature</i>, in order to secure property in society, and prevent the opposition of self-interest; we establish the <i class="calibre10">rules of good-breeding</i>, in order to prevent the opposition of men's pride, and render conversation agreeable and inoffensive. Nothing is more disagreeable than a man's over-weaning conceit of himself: Every one almost has a strong propensity to this vice: No one can well distinguish <i class="calibre10">in himself</i> betwixt the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his esteem of his own merit is well-founded: For these reasons, all direct expressions of this passion are condemn'd; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of sense and merit. They are not allow'd to do themselves justice openly, in words, no more than other people; and even if they show a reserve and secret doubt in doing themselves justice in their own thoughts, they will be more applauded. That impertinent, and almost universal propensity of men, to over-value themselves, has given us such a <i class="calibre10">prejudice</i> against self-applause, that we are apt to condemn it, by general rule, wherever we meet with it; and 'tis with some difficulty we give a privilege to men of sense, even in their most secret thoughts. At least, it must be own'd, that some disguise in this particular is absolutely requisite; and that if we harbour pride in our breasts, we must carry a fair outside. and have the appearance of modesty and mutual deference in all our conduct and behaviour. We must, on every occasion, be ready to prefer others to ourselves; to treat them with a kind of deference, even tho' they be our equals; to seem always the lowest and least in the company, where we are not very much distinguish'd above them: And if we observe these rules in our conduct, men will have more indulgence for our secret sentiments, when we discover them in an oblique manner.</p>

On the contrary, we may observe, that a genuine and hearty pride, or self-esteem, if well conceal'd and well founded, is essential to the character of a man of honour, and that there is no quality of the mind, which is more indispensably requisite to procure the esteem and approbation of mankind. There are certain deferences and mutual submissions, which custom requires of the different ranks of men towards each other; and whoever exceeds in this particular, if thro' interest, is accus'd of meanness; if thro' ignorance, of simplicity. 'Tis necessary, therefore, to know our rank and station in the world, whether it be fix'd by our birth, fortune, employments, talents or reputation. 'Tis necessary to feel the sentiment and passion of pride in conformity to it, and to regulate our actions accordingly. And shou'd it be said, that prudence may suffice to regulate our actions in this particular, without any real pride, I wou'd observe, that here the object of prudence is to conform our actions to the general usage and custom; and that 'tis impossible those tacit airs of superiority shou'd ever have been establish'd and authoriz'd by custom, unless men were generally proud, and unless that passion were generally approv'd, when well-grounded.</p>

Courage, intrepidity, ambition, love of glory, magnanimity, and all the other shining virtues of that kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and derive a great part of their merit from that origin. Accordingly we find, that many religious declaimers decry those virtues as purely pagan and natural, and represent to us the excellency of the <i class="calibre10">Christian</i> religion, which places humility in the rank of virtues, and corrects the judgment of the world, and even of philosophers, who so generally admire all the efforts of pride and ambition. Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly understood, I shall not pretend to determine.

When it goes beyond its just bounds, it loses the first advantage, and even becomes prejudicial; which is the reason why we condemn an extravagant pride and ambition, however regulated by the decorums of good-breeding and politeness. But as such a passion is still agreeable, and conveys an elevated and sublime sensation to the person, who is actuated by it, the sympathy with that satisfaction diminishes considerably the blame, which naturally attends its dangerous influence on his conduct and behaviour. Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes, in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he wou'd never have been acquainted.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">When experience has once given us a competent knowledge of human affairs, and has taught us the proportion they bear to human passion, we perceive, that the generosity of men is very limited, and that it seldom extends beyond their friends and family, or, at most, beyond their native country. Being thus acquainted with the nature of man, we expect not any impossibilities from him; but confine our view to that narrow circle, in which any person moves, in order to form a judgment of his moral character. When the natural tendency of his passions leads him to be serviceable and useful within his sphere, we approve of his character. and love his person, by a sympathy with the sentiments of those, who have a more particular connexion with him. We are quickly oblig'd to forget our own interest in our judgments of this kind, by reason of the perpetual contradictions, we meet with in society and conversation, from persons that are not plac'd in the same situation, and have not the same interest with ourselves. The only point of view, in which our sentiments concur with them of others, is, when we consider the tendency of any passion to the advantage or harm of those, who have any immediate connexion or intercourse with the person possess'd of it. And tho' this advantage or harm be often very remote from ourselves, yet sometimes 'tis very near us, and interests us strongly by sympathy. This concern we readily extend to other cases, that are resembling; and when these are very remote, our sympathy is proportionably weaker, and our praise or blame fainter and more doubtful. The case is here the same as in our judgments concerning external bodies. All objects seem to diminish by their distance: But tho' the appearance of objects to our senses be the original standard, by which we judge of them, yet we do not say, that they actually diminish by the distance; but correcting the appearance by reflection, arrive at a more constant and establish'd judgment concerning them. In like manner, tho' sympathy be much fainter than our concern for ourselves, and a sympathy with persons remote from us much fainter than that with persons near and contiguous; yet we neglect all these differences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of men. Besides, that we ourselves often change our situation in this particular, we every day meet with persons, who are in a different situation from ourselves, and who cou'd never converse with us on any reasonable terms, were we to remain constantly in that situation and point of view, which is peculiar to us. The intercourse of sentiments, therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form some general inalterable standard, by which we may approve or disapprove of characters and manners. And tho' the <i class="calibre10">heart</i> does not always take part with those general notions, or regulate its love and hatred by them, yet are they sufficient for discourse, and serve all our purposes in company, in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the schools.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">当经验让我们对人类事务有了充分的了解，并告诉我们它们与人类激情的比例时，我们就会发现，人的慷慨是非常有限的，它很少超越他们的朋友和家人，或者最多超越他们的祖国。既然对人的本性如此熟悉，我们就不要指望他有什么不可能；而是把我们的视线限制在那个狭小的范围内，任何人都在其中活动，以便对他的道德品质做出判断。当他的激情的自然倾向导致他在他的范围内是可服务的和有用的，我们通过同情那些与他有更具体联系的人的情绪，来认可他的性格，并爱他的人。由于我们在社会上和谈话中遇到的那些与我们处境不同、与我们利益不同的人的不断矛盾，我们很快就不得不在我们的这种判断中忘记自己的利益。唯一能使我们的情感与他人的情感相一致的观点是，当我们考虑到任何激情对那些与拥有这种激情的人有任何直接联系或交往的人有利或有害的趋势时。尽管这种好处或坏处往往离我们很远，但有时却离我们很近，并使我们产生强烈的同情心。这种关心我们很容易扩展到其他类似的情况；而当这些情况非常遥远时，我们的同情心就会相应地减弱，我们的赞美或指责也就更微弱，更令人怀疑。这里的情况与我们对外部物体的判断是一样的。所有的物体似乎都会因其距离而减少。但是，尽管物体在我们感官中的外观是我们判断它们的原始标准，但我们并不是说，它们实际上因距离而减少；而是通过反思来纠正外观，得出一个关于它们的更恒定、更确定的判断。同样，尽管同情心比我们对自己的关心要淡得多，对远离我们的人的同情心比对靠近我们的人的同情心要淡得多；但我们在对人的性格进行冷静判断时，却忽略了所有这些差异。此外，我们自己在这方面经常改变自己的处境，我们每天都会遇到一些人，他们的处境与我们不同，如果我们一直停留在我们所特有的处境和观点上，他们就永远不会与我们进行任何合理的交谈。因此，在社会和谈话中，情感的交流使我们形成了一些普遍的、不可改变的标准，根据这些标准，我们可以批准或不批准人物和举止。尽管人们<i class="calibre10">的心</i>并不总是参与这些一般的观念，或用它们来调节自己的爱与恨，但它们足以用于讨论，并为我们在公司、在讲坛、在剧院和在学校的所有目的服务。</p></div>

'Tis certain we are infinitely touch'd with a tender sentiment, as well as with a great one. The tears naturally start in our eyes at the conception of it; nor can we forbear giving a loose to the same tenderness towards the person who exerts it. All this seems to me a proof, that our approbation has, in those cases, an origin different from the prospect of utility and advantage, either to ourselves or others. To which we may add, that men naturally, without reflection, approve of that character, which is most like their own. The man of a mild disposition and tender affections, in forming a notion of the most perfect virtue, mixes in it more of benevolence and humanity, than the man of courage and enterprize, who naturally looks upon a certain elevation of mind as the most accomplish'd character. This must evidently proceed from an <i class="calibre10">immediate</i> sympathy. which men have with characters similar to their own.

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis remarkable, that nothing touches a man of humanity more than any instance of extraordinary delicacy in love or friendship, where a person is attentive to the smallest concerns of his friend, and is willing to sacrifice to them the most considerable interest of his own. Such delicacies have little influence on society; because they make us regard the greatest trifles: But they are the more engaging, the more minute the concern is, and are a proof of the highest merit in any one, who is capable of them. The passions are so contagious, that they pass with the greatest facility from one person to another, and produce correspondent movements in all human breasts. Where friendship appears in very signal instances, my heart catches the same passion, and is warm'd by those warm sentiments, that display themselves before me. Such agreeable movements must give me an affection to every one that excites them. This is the case with every thing that is agreeable in any person. The transition from pleasure to love is easy: But the transition must here be still more easy; since the agreeable sentiment, which is excited by sympathy, is love itself; and there is nothing requir'd but to change the object.</p>

On the other hand, when we enumerate the good qualities of any person, we always mention those parts of his character, which render him a safe companion, an easy friend, a gentle master, an agreeable husband, or an indulgent father. We consider him with all his relations in society; and love or hate him, according as he affects those, who have any immediate intercourse with him. And 'tis a most certain male, that if there be no relation of life, in which I cou'd not wish to stand to a particular person, his character must so far be allow'd to be perfect.

Whoever considers the matter accurately, will find, that a dispute upon this head wou'd be merely a dispute of words, and that tho' these qualities are not altogether of the same kind, yet they agree in the most material circumstances. They are both of them equally mental qualities: And both of them equally produce pleasure; and have of course an equal tendency to procure the love and esteem of mankind. There are few, who are not as jealous of their character, with regard to sense and knowledge, as to honour and courage; and much more than with regard to temperance and sobriety. Men are even afraid of passing for good-natur'd; lest <i class="calibre10">that</i> shou'd be taken for want of understanding: And often boast of more debauches than they have been really engag'd in, to give themselves airs of fire and spirit. In short, the figure a man makes in the world, the reception he meets with in company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages depend almost as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Let a man have the best intentions in the world, and be the farthest from all injustice and violence, he will never be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at least, of parts and understanding. Since then natural abilities, tho', perhaps, inferior, yet are on the same footing, both as to their causes and effects, with those qualities which we call moral virtues, why shou'd we make any distinction betwixt them?</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">在所有的伦理学体系中，最常见的区别莫过于<i class="calibre10">自然能力</i>和<i class="calibre10">道德美</i>德之间的区别；前者被置于与身体天赋相同的地位，并被认为没有任何功绩或道德价值附属于它们。谁能准确地考虑这个问题，谁就会发现，在这个问题上的争论仅仅是文字上的争论，虽然这些品质并不完全是同一种，但它们在最实质的情况下是一致的。它们都是同样的精神品质。两者都同样能产生快乐；当然也有同样的趋势来获得人类的爱和尊敬。很少有人不对自己的品格，在理智和知识方面，与在荣誉和勇气方面一样嫉妒；而且比在节制和清醒方面更嫉妒。人们甚至害怕被认为是好人，以免被认为<i class="calibre10">是</i>缺乏理解。他们常常吹嘘自己的放荡行为比他们真正从事过的还要多，以便给自己披上火焰和精神的外衣。总之，一个人在世界上的形象，他在公司里受到的欢迎，他的熟人对他的尊敬；所有这些优势几乎都取决于他的良好意识和判断力，就像他性格的任何其他部分一样。即使一个人有世界上最好的意图，并且最远离一切不公正和暴力，但如果没有适度的部分和理解力，他将永远无法使自己受到重视。既然自然能力，尽管可能是低级的，但就其原因和效果而言，与我们称之为道德美德的那些品质处于同样的地位，我们为什么要在它们之间做出任何区分呢？</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Tho' we refuse to natural abilities the title of virtues, we must allow, that they procure the love and esteem of mankind; that they give a new lustre to the other virtues; and that a man possess'd of them is much more intitled to our good-will and services, than one entirely void of them. It may, indeed, be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those qualities produce, besides its being <i class="calibre10">inferior</i>, is also somewhat <i class="calibre10">different</i> from that, which attends the other virtues. But this, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason for excluding them from the catalogue of virtues. Each of the virtues, even benevolence, justice, gratitude, integrity, excites a different sentiment or feeling in the spectator. The characters of <i class="calibre10">Cæsar</i> and <i class="calibre10">Cato</i>, as drawn by <i class="calibre10">Sallust</i>, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest sense of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise from them. The one produces love; the other esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We cou'd wish to meet with the one character in a friend; the other character we wou'd be ambitious of in ourselves. In like manner, the approbation, which attends natural abilities, may be somewhat different to the feeling from that, which arise from the other virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And indeed we may observe, that the natural abilities, no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation.

		<p class="block_6 en">Those, who represent the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues as very material, may say, that the former are entirely involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no dependence on liberty and free-will. But to this I answer, <i class="calibre10">first</i>, that many of those qualities, which all moralists, especially the antients, comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and necessary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagination. Of this nature are constancy, fortitude, magnanimity; and, in short, all the qualities which form the <i class="calibre10">great</i> man. I might say the same, in some degree, of the others; it being almost impossible for the mind to change its character in any considerable article. or cure itself of a passionate or splenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater degree there is of these blame able qualities, the more vicious they become, and yet they are the less voluntary. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, I wou'd have any one give me a reason, why virtue and vice may not be involuntary, as well as beauty and deformity. These moral distinctions arise from the natural distinctions of pain and pleasure; and when we receive those feelings from the general consideration of any quality or character, we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will assert, that a quality can never produce pleasure or pain to the person who considers it, unless it be perfectly voluntary in the person who possesses it. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, As to free-will, we have shewn that it has no place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It is not a just consequence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions are more voluntary than our judgments; but we have not more liberty in the one than in the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">那些认为自然能力和道德美德之间的区别非常重要的人可能会说，前者完全是非自愿的，因此没有任何优点，因为它们不依赖于自由和自由意志。但对此我的回答是，<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，所有道德家，特别是古代人，在道德美德的标题下所包含的许多品质，与判断力和想象力的品质一样，都是非自愿和必要的。这种性质的美德包括恒心、毅力、宽宏大量；简而言之，就是构成<i class="calibre10">伟人</i>的所有品质。我可以说，在某种程度上，其他的品质也是如此；当这些品质是自然形成的时候，思想几乎不可能在任何相当大的程度上改变其特性，也不可能治愈自己的激情或脾性。这些可责备的品质的程度越高，它们就越恶毒，但它们却越不自愿。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，我希望有人能给我一个理由，为什么美德和恶习不可能是非自愿的，就像美丽和畸形一样。这些道德上的区别来自于痛苦和快乐的自然区别；当我们从对任何品质或特征的一般考虑中得到这些感觉时，我们就会把它称为恶性或良性。现在我相信没有人会断言，一种品质永远不会对考虑它的人产生快乐或痛苦，除非它在拥有它的人身上是完全自愿的。<i class="calibre10">第三</i>，关于自由意志，我们已经证明，它在行为方面没有地位，就像人的品质一样。这并不是一个公正的结果，即自愿的就是自由的。我们的行为比我们的判断更加自愿；但我们在一个方面的自由并不比另一个方面的自由多。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">But tho' this distinction betwixt voluntary and involuntary be not sufficient to justify the distinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues, yet the former distinction will afford us a plausible reason, why moralists have invented the latter. Men have observ'd, that tho' natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the same footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the former are almost invariable by any art or industry; while the latter, or at least, the actions, that proceed from them, may be chang'd by the motives of rewards and punishments, praise and blame. Hence legislators, and divines, and moralists, have principally applied themselves to the regulating these voluntary actions, and have endeavour'd to produce additional motives for being virtuous in that particular. They knew, that to punish a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and sagacious, wou'd have but little effect; tho' the same punishments and exhortations, with regard to justice and injustice, might have a considerable influence. But as men, in common life and conversation, do not carry those ends in view, but naturally praise or blame whatever pleases or displeases them, they do not seem much to regard this distinction, but consider prudence under the character of virtue as well as benevolence, and penetration as well as justice. Nay, we find, that all moralists, whose judgment is not perverted by a strict adherence to a system, enter into the same way of thinking; and that the antient moralists in particular made no scruple of placing prudence at the head of the cardinal virtues. There is a sentiment of esteem and approbation, which may be excited, in some degree, by any faculty of the mind, in its perfect state and condition; and to account for this sentiment is the business of <i class="calibre10">Philosophers</i>. It belongs to <i class="calibre10">Grammarians</i> to examine what qualities are entitled to the denomination of <i class="calibre10">virtue</i>; nor will they find, upon trial, that this is so easy a task, as at first sight they may be apt to imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">但是，尽管自愿和非自愿之间的这种区别不足以证明自然能力和道德品质之间的区别，但前者的区别可以为我们提供一个合理的理由，说明为什么道德家会发明后者。人们注意到，虽然自然能力和道德品质在本质上是相同的，但它们之间有这样的区别，即前者几乎不受任何艺术或工业的影响；而后者，或者至少，由它们产生的行为，可能会因奖惩、褒贬的动机而改变。因此，立法者、神学家和道德家们主要致力于规范这些自愿的行为，并努力产生更多的动机，以便在这方面保持美德。他们知道，惩罚一个人的愚蠢，或者劝告他谨慎和明智，都不会有什么效果；尽管同样的惩罚和劝告，对于正义和不正义，可能有相当大的影响。但是，由于人们在普通的生活和谈话中并不考虑这些目的，而是自然地赞美或指责任何使他们高兴或不高兴的事情，因此他们似乎并不重视这种区别，而是把谨慎放在美德和仁爱的特征之下，把洞察力放在正义之下。我们发现，所有的道德家，只要他们的判断力没有被严格遵守的制度所扭曲，都会采取同样的思维方式；尤其是古代的道德家，他们毫不犹豫地把审慎放在基本美德的首位。在完美的状态和条件下，心灵的任何能力都会在某种程度上激发出一种尊敬和赞许的情绪；而解释这种情绪是<i class="calibre10">哲学家</i>的工作。<i class="calibre10">语法学家</i>应该研究哪些品质有权被称为<i class="calibre10">美德</i>；经过试验，他们也不会发现这是个很容易的任务，就像他们初看时可能会想象的那样。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">'Tis difficult to tell, on many occasions, what it is that renders one man's conversation so agreeable and entertaining, and another's so insipid and distasteful. As conversation is a transcript of the mind as well as books, the same qualities, which render the one valuable, must give us an esteem for the other. This we shall consider afterwards. In the mean time it may be affirm'd in general, that all the merit a man may derive from his conversation (which, no doubt, may be very considerable) arises from nothing but the pleasure it conveys to those who are present.</p>

In this case, as well as in that of wit and eloquence, we must have recourse to a certain sense, which acts without reflection and regards not the tendencies of qualities and characters. Some moralists account for all the sentiments of virtue by this sense. Their hypothesis is very plausible. Nothing but a particular enquiry can give the preference to any other hypothesis. When we find, that almost all the virtues have such particular tendencies; and also find, that these tendencies are sufficient alone to give a strong sentiment of approbation: We cannot doubt, after this, that qualities are approv'd of, in proportion to the advantage, which results from them.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">That faculty of the soul, which, of all others, is of the least consequence to the character, and has the least virtue or vice in its several degrees, at the same time, that it admits of a great variety of degrees, is the <i class="calibre10">memory</i>. Unless it rise up to that stupendous height as to surprize us, or sink so low as, in some measure, to affect the judgment, we commonly take no notice of its variations, nor ever mention them to the praise or dispraise of any person. 'Tis so far from being a virtue to have a good memory, that men generally affect to complain of a bad one; and endeavouring to persuade the world, that what they say is entirely of their own invention, sacrifice it to the praise of genius and judgment. Yet to consider the matter abstractedly, 'twou'd be difficult to give a reason, why the faculty of recalling past ideas with truth and clearness, shou'd not have as much merit in it, as the faculty of placing our present ideas in such an order, as to form true propositions and opinions. The reason of the difference certainly must be, that the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or pain; and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in business and affairs. But the least variations in the judgment are sensibly felt in their consequences; while at the same time that faculty is never exerted in any eminent degree, without an extraordinary delight and satisfaction. The sympathy with this utility and pleasure bestows a merit on the understanding; and the absence of it makes us consider the memory as a faculty very indifferent to blame or praise.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">It has been observ'd, in treating of the passions, that pride and humility, love and hatred, are excited by any advantage or disadvantages of the mind, body, or fortune; and that these advantages or disadvantages have that effect, by producing a separate impression of pain or pleasure. The pain or pleasure, which arises from the general survey or view of any action or quality of the mind, constitutes its vice or virtue, and gives rise to our approbation or blame, which is nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred. We have assign'd four different sources of this pain and pleasure; and in order to justify more fully that hypothesis, it may here be proper to observe, that the advantages or disadvantages of the <i class="calibre10">body</i> and of <i class="calibre10">fortune</i>, produce a pain or pleasure from the very same principles. The tendency of any object to be <i class="calibre10">useful</i> to the person possess'd of it, or to others; to convey <i class="calibre10">pleasure</i> to him or to others; all these circumstances convey an immediate pleasure to the person, who considers the object, and command his love and approbation.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在论述激情时，人们注意到，骄傲和谦卑、爱和恨，都是由心灵、身体或财富的任何优势或劣势所激发的；这些优势或劣势通过产生单独的痛苦或快乐印象而产生这种效果。从对心灵的任何行动或品质的一般调查或看法中产生的痛苦或快乐，构成了它的恶习或美德，并引起我们的赞许或指责，这只不过是一种更微弱、更难以察觉的爱或恨。我们已经指定了这种痛苦和快乐的四个不同来源；为了更充分地证明这一假设，在此可以适当地指出，<i class="calibre10">身体</i>和<i class="calibre10">财富</i>的优势或劣势，从相同的原则中产生痛苦或快乐。任何物体对拥有它的人或其他人<i class="calibre10">有用的</i>趋势；对他或其他人带来的<i class="calibre10">快乐</i>；所有这些情况都会给考虑该物体的人带来直接的快乐，并得到他的喜爱和赞许。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">To begin with the advantages of the <i class="calibre10">body</i>; we may observe a phænomenon, which might appear somewhat trivial and ludicrous, if any thing cou'd be trivial, which fortified a conclusion of such importance, or ludicrous, which was employ'd in a philosophical reasoning. 'Tis a general remark, that those we call good <i class="calibre10">women's men</i>, who have either signaliz'd themselves by their amorous exploits, or whose make of body promises any extraordinary vigour of that kind, are well received by the fair sex, and naturally engage the affections even of those, whose virtue prevents any design of ever giving employment to those talents. Here 'tis evident, that the ability of such a person to give enjoyment, is the real source of that love and esteem he meets with among the females; at the same time that the women, who love and esteem him, have no prospect of receiving that enjoyment themselves, and can only be affected by means of their sympathy with one, that has a commerce of love with' him. This instance is singular, and merits our attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">从<i class="calibre10">身体</i>的优势开始，我们可以观察到一个现象，它可能显得有些微不足道和可笑，如果有任何事情可以微不足道，以加强一个如此重要的结论，或者可笑，这是采用了哲学推理的。一般说来，那些被我们称为好<i class="calibre10">女人的男人</i>，如果他们以风流韵事来标榜自己，或者他们的身体有任何非凡的活力，都会受到漂亮女人的欢迎，甚至自然而然地吸引那些美德使其无法发挥这些才能的人的感情。这里很明显的是，这种人给人以享受的能力，是他在女性中受到爱戴和尊敬的真正来源；同时，爱戴他的女性，自己也没有希望得到这种享受，只能通过同情一个与他有爱情交易的人而受到影响。这个例子很奇特，值得我们注意。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Another source of the pleasure we receive from considering bodily advantages, is their utility to the person himself, who is possess'd of them. 'Tis certain, that a considerable part of the beauty of men, as well as of other animals, consists in such a conformation of members, as we find by experience to be attended with strength and agility, and to capacitate the creature for any action or exercise. Broad shoulders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all these are beautiful in our species, because they are signs of force and vigour, which being advantages we naturally sympathize with, they convey to the beholder a share of that satisfaction they produce in the possessor.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我们从考虑身体优势中得到乐趣的另一个来源，是它们对拥有这些优势的人本身的效用。可以肯定的是，人和其他动物的美有相当一部分是由肢体的结构组成的，我们通过经验发现，这种结构具有力量和敏捷性，并使生物有能力进行任何行动或锻炼。宽阔的肩膀，瘦弱的腹部，坚实的关节，细长的腿；所有这些在我们这个物种中都是美丽的，因为它们是力量和活力的标志，我们自然同情这些优点，它们向观察者传达了它们在拥有者身上产生的那份满意。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">So far as to the <i class="calibre10">ability</i>, which may attend any quality of the body. As to the immediate <i class="calibre10">pleasure</i>, 'tis certain, that an air of health, as well as of strength and agility, makes a considerable part of beauty; and that a sickly air in another is always disagreeable, upon account of that idea of pain and uneasiness, which it conveys to us. On the other hand, we are pleas'd with the regularity of our own features, tho' it be neither useful, to ourselves nor others; and 'tis necessary for us, in some measure, to set ourselves at a distance, to make it convey to us any satisfaction. We commonly consider ourselves as we appear in the eyes of others, and sympathize with the advantageous sentiments they entertain with regard to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">就<i class="calibre10">能力</i>而言，身体的任何品质都可能带来能力。至于直接的<i class="calibre10">快乐</i>，可以肯定的是，健康的气息，以及力量和敏捷，构成了美丽的一个重要部分；另一个人身上的病态气息总是令人不快的，因为它给我们带来了痛苦和不安的想法。另一方面，我们对自己五官的规则性感到高兴，尽管它对自己和别人都没有用处；而且在某种程度上，我们有必要把自己放在一个较远的地方，以使它给我们带来任何满足。我们通常会考虑自己在别人眼中的样子，并同情他们对我们的有利看法。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">How far the advantages of <i class="calibre10">fortune</i> produce esteem and approbation from the same principles, we may satisfy ourselves by redacting on our precedent reasoning on that subject. We have observ'd, that our approbation of those, who are possess'd of the advantages of fortune, may be ascrib'd to three different causes. <i class="calibre10">First</i>, To that immediate pleasure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful cloaths, equipage, gardens, or houses, which he possesses. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, To the advantage, which we hope to reap from him by his generosity and liberality. <i class="calibre10">Thirdly</i>, To the pleasure and advantage, which he himself reaps from his possessions, and which produce an agreeable sympathy in us. Whether we ascribe our esteem of the rich and great to one or all of these causes, we may clearly see the traces of those principles, which give rise to the sense of vice and virtue. I believe most people, at first sight, will be inclin'd to ascribe our esteem of the rich to self-interest, and the prospect of advantage. But as 'tis certain, that our esteem or deference extends beyond any prospect of advantage to ourselves, 'tis evident, that that sentiment must proceed from a sympathy with those, who are dependent on the person we esteem and respect, and who have an immediate connexion with him. We consider him as a person capable of contributing to the happiness or enjoyment of his fellow-creatures, whose sentiments, with regard to him, we naturally embrace. And this consideration will serve to justify my hypothesis in preferring the <i class="calibre10">third</i> principle to the other two, and ascribing our esteem of the rich to a sympathy with the pleasure and advantage, which they themselves receive from their possessions. For as even the other two principles cannot operate to a due extent, or account for all the phænomena, without having recourse to a sympathy of one kind or other; 'tis much more natural to chuse that sympathy, which is immediate and direct, than that which is remote and indirect. To which we may add, that where the riches or power are very great, and render the person considerable and important in the world, the esteem attending them, may, in part, be ascrib'd to another source, distinct from these three, <i class="calibre10">viz.</i> their interesting the mind by a prospect of the multitude, and importance of their consequences: Tho', in order to account for the operation of this principle, we must also have recourse to <i class="calibre10">sympathy</i>; as we have observ' d in the preceding section.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn"><i class="calibre10">财富</i>的优势在多大程度上能从同样的原则中产生尊敬和赞许，我们可以通过改写我们在这个问题上的先例推理来满足自己。我们已经注意到，我们对那些拥有财富优势的人的赞许，可以归结为三个不同的原因。<i class="calibre10">第一</i>，富人通过观看他所拥有的漂亮衣服、装备、花园或房屋，给我们带来的直接快乐。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，我们希望通过他的慷慨和宽大从他那里获得的好处。<i class="calibre10">第三</i>，他自己从他的财产中获得的快乐和好处，这在我们心中产生了一种愉快的共鸣。无论我们把对富人和大人物的尊敬归因于这些原因中的一个或全部，我们都可以清楚地看到这些原则的痕迹，这些原则引起了对罪恶和美德的感觉。我相信，大多数人乍一看，会倾向于把我们对富人的尊重归结为自我利益和利益前景的考虑。但可以肯定的是，我们的尊敬或尊重超越了对自己有利的前景，很明显，这种情绪必须来自对那些依赖我们尊敬和尊重的人的同情，以及与他有直接联系的人的同情。我们认为他是一个能够为他的同胞的幸福或享受作出贡献的人，我们自然会接受他们对他的情感。这一考虑将有助于证明我的假设，即宁愿选择<i class="calibre10">第三条</i>原则而不是其他两条原则，并将我们对富人的尊重归结为对他们自己从其财产中得到的快乐和好处的同情。因为即使是其他两个原则，如果不借助这样或那样的同情心，也不可能在适当的程度上发挥作用，也不可能解释所有的现象；选择那种直接的同情心，比选择那种遥远的、间接的同情心要自然得多。对此，我们可以补充说，如果财富或权力非常大，并使这个人在这个世界上相当重要，那么对他们的尊敬，在一定程度上可以归因于与这三者不同的另一个来源，<i class="calibre10">即</i>他们通过对其后果的众多和重要性的展望来引起人们的关注。但是，为了解释这一原则的运作，我们还必须求助于<i class="calibre10">同情心</i>；正如我们在上一节中所观察到的那样。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">It may not be amiss, on this occasion, to remark the flexibility of our sentiments, and the several changes they so readily receive from the objects, with which they are conjoin'd. All the sentiments of approbation, which attend any particular species of objects, have a great resemblance to each other, tho' deriv'd from different sources; and, on the other hand, those sentiments, when directed to different objects, are different to the feeling, tho' deriv'd from the same source. Thus the beauty of all visible objects causes a pleasure pretty much the same, tho' it be sometimes deriv'd from the mere <i class="calibre10">species</i> and appearance of the objects; sometimes from sympathy, and an idea of their utility. In like manner, whenever we survey the actions and characters of men, without any particular interest in them, the pleasure, or pain, which arises from the survey (with some minute differences) is, in the main, of the same kind, tho' perhaps there be a great diversity in the causes, from which it is deriv'd. On the other hand, a convenient house, and a virtuous character, cause not the same feeling of approbation; even tho' the source of our approbation be the same, and flow from sympathy and an idea of their utility. There is something very inexplicable in this variation of our feelings; but 'tis what we have experience of with regard to all our passions and sentiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在这种情况下，说说我们的情感的灵活性，以及它们很容易从与之相联系的对象那里得到的几种变化，可能不会有什么问题。所有的赞美之情，在任何特定种类的物体上，都有很大的相似性，尽管来自不同的来源；另一方面，这些情感，当指向不同的物体时，虽然来自同一来源，但却有不同的感觉。因此，所有看得见的物体的美都会引起一种几乎相同的快乐，尽管它有时仅仅来自物体的<i class="calibre10">种类</i>和外观；有时来自同情，以及对其效用的想法。同样，当我们观察人的行为和性格时，如果对他们没有任何特别的兴趣，那么从观察中产生的快乐或痛苦（有一些细微的差别）主要是同类的，尽管它所产生的原因可能有很大的差异。另一方面，一个方便的房子和一个有德行的人，引起的赞许感是不一样的；即使我们赞许的来源是一样的，是来自于同情和对其效用的想法。在我们感情的这种变化中，有一些非常令人费解的东西；但这是我们对我们所有的激情和情感的经验。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">Thus upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an accurate proof of this system of ethics. We are certain, that sympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature. We are also certain, that it has a great influence on our sense of beauty, when we regard external objects, as well as when we judge of morals. We find that it has force sufficient to give us the strongest sentiments of approbation, when it operates alone, without the concurrence of any other principle; as in the cases of justice, allegiance, chastity, and good-manners. We may observe, that all the circumstances requisite for its operation are found in most of the virtues; which have, for the most part, a tendency to the good of society, or to that of the person possess'd of them. If we compare all these circumstances, we shall not doubt, that sympathy is the chief source of moral distinctions; especially when we reflect, that no objection can be rais'd against this hypothesis in one case, which will not extend to all cases. justice is certainly approv'd of for no other reason, than because it has a tendency to the public good: And the public good is indifferent to us, except so far as sympathy interests us in it. We may presume the like with regard to all the other virtues, which have a like tendency to the public good. They must derive all their merit from our sympathy with those, who reap any advantage from them: As the virtues, which have a tendency to the good of the person possess'd of them, derive their merit from our sympathy with him.</p>

This way of thinking is so natural, and occurs on so many occasions, that few will make any scruple of admitting it. Now this being once admitted, the force of sympathy must necessarily be acknowledge'd. Virtue is consider'd as means to an end. Means to an end are only valued so far as the end is valued. But the happiness of strangers affects us by sympathy alone. To that principle, therefore, we are to ascribe the sentiment of approbation, which arises from the survey of all those virtues, 'that are useful to society, or to the person possess'd of them.

All lovers of virtue (and such we all are in speculation, however we may degenerate in practice) must certainly be pleas'd to see moral distinctions deriv'd from so noble a source, which gives us a just notion both of the <i class="calibre10">generosity</i> and <i class="calibre10">capacity</i> of human nature. It requires but very little knowledge of human affairs to perceive, that a sense of morals is a principle inherent in the soul, and one of the most powerful that enters into the composition. But this sense must certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself; it approves of those principles, from whence it is deriv'd, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin. Those who resolve the sense of morals into original instincts of the human mind, may defend the cause of virtue with sufficient authority; but want the advantage, which those possess, who account for that sense by an extensive sympathy with mankind. According to their system, not only virtue must be approv'd of, but also the sense of virtue: And not only that sense, but also the principles, from whence it is deriv'd.

The interest, on which justice is founded, is the greatest imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It cannot possibly be serv'd by any other invention.

Who indeed does not feel an accession of alacrity in his pursuits of knowledge and ability of every kind, when he considers, that besides the advantage, which immediately result from these acquisitions, they also give him a new lustre in the eyes of mankind, and are universally attended with esteem and approbation?

The anatomist ought never to emulate the painter; nor in his accurate dissections and portraiture's of the smaller parts of the human body, pretend to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or expression. There is even something hideous, or at least minute in the views of things, which he presents; and 'tis necessary the objects shou'd be set more at a distance, and be more cover'd up from sight, to make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An anatomist, however, is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and 'tis even impracticable to excel in the latter art, without the assistance of the former. We must have an exact knowledge of the parts, their situation and connexion, before we can design with any elegance or correctness.

		<p class="block_6 en">We can never be induced to believe any matter of fact, except where its cause, or its effect, is present to us; but what the nature is of that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect, few have had the curiosity to ask themselves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is some new idea, such as that of reality or existence, which we join to the simple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar feeling or sentiment. That it is not a new idea, annexed to the simple conception, may be evinced from these two arguments. First, We have no abstract idea of existence, distinguishable and separable from the idea of particular objects. It is impossible, therefore, that this idea of existence can be annexed to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a simple conception and belief. Secondly, The mind has the command over all its ideas, and can separate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it pleases; so that if belief consisted merely in a new idea, annexed to the conception, it would be in a man's power to believe what he pleased. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief consists merely in a certain feeling or sentiment; in something, that depends not on the will, but must arise from certain determinate causes and principles, of which we are not masters. When we are convinced of any matter of fact, we do nothing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere reveries of the imagination. And when we express our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief consist in a sentiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were presented by the wildest imagination, would be on an equal footing with the most established truths founded on history and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or sentiment, to distinguish the one from the other.</p>

		<p class="block_6 cn">我们永远不可能被诱导去相信任何事实，除非它的原因或它的结果出现在我们面前；但这种信念的性质是什么，它产生于因果关系，很少有人有好奇心去问自己。在我看来，这种两难的局面是不可避免的。要么信念是某种新的观念，如现实或存在的观念，我们把它与物体的简单概念联系起来，要么它只是一种特殊的感觉或情绪。这不是一个新的想法，附在简单的概念上，可以从这两个论据中看出。首先，我们没有关于存在的抽象概念，可以与特定对象的概念相区别和分离。因此，这种存在的观念不可能附在任何物体的观念上，也不可能形成简单概念和信仰之间的差异。第二，心灵拥有对其所有观念的控制权，可以随心所欲地分离、结合、混合和改变它们；因此，如果信仰仅仅包括一个新的观念，附在概念之后，那么一个人就有能力相信他所喜欢的东西。因此，我们可以得出结论，信仰仅仅是由某种感觉或情感组成的；是由某种不取决于意志的东西组成的，但必须由某些确定的原因和原则产生，而我们并不是这些原因和原则的主人。当我们确信任何事实的时候，我们所做的只是把它和某种感觉一起设想出来，这与单纯的想象力的遐想不同。当我们对任何事实表示难以置信时，我们的意思是，对该事实的论证没有产生这种感觉。如果信仰不是由一种不同于我们单纯概念的情感组成，那么无论最疯狂的想象力所呈现的对象，都会与建立在历史和经验基础上的最成熟的真理处于同等地位。除了感觉，或者说情感，没有任何东西可以将两者区分开来。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">This, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the simple conception, the next question, that naturally occurs, is, what is the nature of this feeling, or sentiment, and whether it be analogous to any other sentiment of the human mind? This question is important. For if it be not analogous to any other sentiment, we must despair of explaining its causes, and must consider it as an original principle of the human mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its causes from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmness and solidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of conviction and assurance, than in the loose and indolent reveries of a castle-builder, every one will readily own. They strike upon us with more force; they are more present to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and moved by them. It acquiesces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and reposes itself on them. In short, they approach nearer to the impressions, which are immediately present to us; and are therefore analogous to many other operations of the mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">因此，既然被视为一个毋庸置疑的事实，即信仰只不过是一种特殊的感觉，与简单的概念不同，那么自然而然出现的下一个问题是，这种感觉或情感的性质是什么，它是否与人类心灵的任何其他情感相类似？这个问题很重要。因为如果它不与任何其他情感相类似，我们就必须对解释它的原因感到绝望，必须把它视为人类心灵的一个原始原则。如果它是类比的，我们就可以希望从类比中解释它的原因，并追溯到更普遍的原则。现在，作为信念和保证的对象的概念，比起城堡建造者的松散和懒散的遐想，有更大的坚定性和牢固性，每个人都会轻易地承认。它们更有力地冲击着我们；它们更贴近我们；心灵对它们有更坚定的把握，并且更受它们的驱动和感动。它默许它们；而且，在某种程度上，将自己固定在它们身上。简而言之，它们更接近于印象，而印象是立即呈现在我们面前的；因此，它们类似于心灵的许多其他操作。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">There is not, in my opinion, any possibility of evading this conclusion, but by asserting, that belief, beside the simple conception, consists in some impression or feeling, distinguishable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more present and intense: It is only annexed to it, after the same manner that will and desire are annexed to particular conceptions of good and pleasure. But the following considerations will, I hope, be sufficient to remove this hypothesis. First, It is directly contrary to experience, and our immediate consciousness. All men have ever allowed reasoning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however those ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our conclusions but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For instance; I hear at present a person's voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this sound comes from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thoughts to the person, along with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existent at present, with the same qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them possessed of. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than the ideas of an inchanted castle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no distinct or separate impression attending them. It is the same case when I recollect the several incidents of a journey, or the events of any history. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loose reveries of a castle-builder: But no distinct impression attends every distinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the subject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be disputed on any occasion, it is when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being presented with a new argument, fixes and reposes itself in one settled conclusion and belief. In this case there is a feeling distinct and separate from the conception. The passage from doubt and agitation to tranquility and repose, conveys a satisfaction and pleasure to the mind. But take any other case. Suppose I see the legs and thighs of a person in motion, while some interposed object conceals the rest of his body. Here it is certain, the imagination spreads out the whole figure. I give him a head and shoulders, and breast and neck. These members I conceive and believe him to be possessed of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is performed by the thought or imagination alone. The transition is immediate. The ideas presently strike us. Their customary connexion with the present impression, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, distinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">在我看来，没有任何可能回避这个结论，只能断言，信仰除了简单的概念之外，还包括一些与概念不同的印象或感觉。它并不修改概念，使其更加存在和强烈：它只是附属于它，就像意志和欲望附属于善和快乐的特定概念一样。但是，我希望以下的考虑将足以消除这一假设。首先，它直接违背了经验，以及我们的直接意识。所有的人都认为推理仅仅是我们的思想或观念的运作；无论这些观念在感觉上如何变化，我们的结论中除了观念，或我们较微弱的概念，没有任何东西进入。例如，我现在听到一个人的声音，我和他很熟；这个声音来自隔壁的房间。我的感官的这一印象立即将我的想法传达给这个人，以及所有周围的物体。我把它们描绘出来，认为它们现在就存在，具有与我以前知道的它们所具有的相同的品质和关系。这些想法在我的脑海中占据了更快的位置，就像对一座英特尔城堡的想法一样。它们与感觉不同；但它们没有明显的或单独的印象。当我回忆一次旅行的几个事件或任何历史事件时，情况也是如此。每一个特定的事实都是信仰的对象。它的概念与一个建造城堡的人松散的遐想不同。但是，每一个独特的想法，或对事实的概念，都没有明显的印象。这是普通经验的主题。如果说这种经验在任何情况下都能引起争议的话，那就是当人们的思想被疑惑和困难所激荡时；之后，当人们从一个新的角度看待这个对象，或者被提出一个新的论点时，就会把自己固定在一个固定的结论和信念中。在这种情况下，有一种与概念不同的、独立的感觉。从怀疑和激动到平静和安宁的过程，给心灵带来了一种满足和愉悦。但在其他情况下。假设我看到一个人的腿和大腿在运动，而一些夹杂的物体掩盖了他身体的其余部分。在这里，可以肯定的是，想象力会把整个人物展开。我给他一个头和肩膀，以及乳房和脖子。我设想并相信他拥有这些成员。没有什么比这更明显的了，这整个操作是由思想或想象力单独完成的。这种转变是直接的。这些想法很快就打动了我们。它们与当前印象的惯常联系，以某种方式改变了它们，修正了它们，但并没有产生与这种特殊的概念不同的思维行为。让任何一个人检查他自己的思想，他就会明显地发现这是事实。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Secondly, Whatever may be the case, with regard to this distinct impression, it must be allowed, that the mind has a firmer hold, or more steady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply suppositions without necessity?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第二，无论情况如何，关于这种明显的印象，必须承认，头脑对它认为是事实的东西比对虚构的东西有更坚定的把握，或更稳定的概念。那么，为什么还要看得更远，或者在没有必要的情况下增加假设呢？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Thirdly, We can explain the causes of the firm conception, but not those of any separate impression. And not only so, but the causes of the firm conception exhaust the whole subject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference concerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently conjoined, or is associated with a present impression. This is the whole of it. Every part is requisite to explain, from analogy, the more steady conception; and nothing remains capable of producing any distinct impression.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第三，我们可以解释坚定概念的原因，但不能解释任何单独印象的原因。不仅如此，坚定的概念的原因耗尽了整个主题，没有留下任何东西可以产生任何其他效果。关于一个事实的推论，只不过是一个对象的概念，它经常与当前的印象结合在一起，或与之相关。这就是它的全部。每一部分都是必要的，可以通过类比来解释更稳定的概念；而没有任何东西能够产生任何独特的印象。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">Fourthly, The effects of belief, in influencing the passions and imagination, can all be explained from the firm conception; and there is no occasion to have recourse to any other principle. These arguments, with many others, enumerated in the foregoing volumes, sufficiently prove, that belief only modifies the idea or conception; and renders it different to the feeling, without producing any distinct impression. Thus upon a general view of the subject, there appear to be two questions of importance, which we may venture to recommend to the consideration of philosophers, Whether there be any thing to distinguish belief from the simple conception beside the feeling of sentiment? And, Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception, or a faster hold, that we take of the object?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">第四，信仰对激情和想象力的影响，都可以从坚定的观念中得到解释；没有必要求助于任何其他原则。这些论据，加上前面几卷中列举的其他许多论据，足以证明，信仰只是修改了观念或概念；并使之与感觉不同，而没有产生任何明显的印象。因此，从这个问题的总体来看，似乎有两个重要的问题，我们可以大胆地建议哲学家们考虑：除了情感的感觉之外，是否有任何东西可以将信仰与简单的概念区分开来？还有，这种感觉是否是我们对对象的一种更坚定的概念或更快的坚持？</p></div>
</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">If, upon impartial enquiry, the same conclusion, that I have formed, be assented to by philosophers, the next business is to examine the analogy, which there is betwixt belief, and other acts of the mind, and find the cause of the firmness and strength of conception: And this I do not esteem a difficult task. The transition from a present impression, always enlivens and strengthens any idea. When any object is presented, the idea of its usual attendant immediately strikes us, as something real and solid. It is felt, rather than conceived, and approaches the impression, from which it is derived, in its force and influence. This I have proved at large. I cannot add any new arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">如果经过公正的调查，我得出的相同结论得到了哲学家们的认同，那么接下来的工作就是研究信仰和心灵的其他行为之间的类比，并找到概念的坚定性和力量的原因。我认为这并不是一项困难的任务。从现在的印象过渡到现在，总是能使任何想法变得更有活力，更有力量。当任何物体呈现出来时，其通常伴随的想法会立即冲击我们，成为真实和坚实的东西。它是被感觉到的，而不是被构想出来的，并且在其力量和影响方面接近于它所来自的印象。这一点我已经充分证明了。我不能增加任何新的论据。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In general, the following reasoning seems satisfactory. All ideas are borrowed from preceding perceptions. Our ideas of objects, therefore, are derived from that source. Consequently no proposition can be intelligible or consistent with regard to objects, which is not so with regard to perceptions. But it is intelligible and consistent to say, that objects exist distinct and independent, without any common simple substance or subject of inhesion. This proposition, therefore, can never be absurd with regard to perceptions.</p>

It is the composition of these, therefore, which forms the self. We can conceive a thinking being to have either many or few perceptions. Suppose the mind to be reduced even below the life of an oyster. Suppose it to have only one perception, as of thirst or hunger. Consider it in that situation. Do you conceive any thing but merely that perception? Have you any notion of self or substance? If not, the addition of other perceptions can never give you that notion.</p>

		<p class="block_6 en">So far I seem to be attended with sufficient evidence. But having thus loosened all our particular perceptions, when I proceed to explain the principle of connexion, which binds them together, and makes us attribute to them a real simplicity and identity; I am sensible, that my account is very defective, and that nothing but the seeming evidence of the precedent reasonings coued have induced me to receive it. If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human understanding. We only feel a connexion or determination of the thought, to pass from one object to another. It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds personal identity, when reflecting on the train of past perceptions, that compose a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprize us. Most philosophers seem inclined to think, that personal identity arises from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, when I come to explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness. I cannot discover any theory, which gives me satisfaction on this head.</p>
</div>

		<p class="block_6 cn">到目前为止，我似乎有了足够的证据。但是，当我把我们所有的特殊知觉都松开之后，当我继续解释把它们联系在一起，并使我们把它们归结为真正的简单性和同一性的联系原则时，我意识到，我的说法是非常有缺陷的，而且除了前面的推理的看似证据之外，没有任何东西能促使我接受它。如果感知是独特的存在，那么它们只有通过连接在一起才构成一个整体。但人类的理解力永远无法发现不同存在之间的联系。我们只感觉到思想的联系或决定，从一个对象到另一个对象。因此，只有思想才能找到个人的身份，当反思过去的一系列感知时，这些感知构成了一个头脑，它们的想法被认为是联系在一起的，并自然地相互介绍。无论这个结论看起来多么不寻常，它都不必让我们感到惊讶。大多数哲学家似乎都倾向于认为，个人身份产生于意识；而意识只不过是一种反射的思想或感知。因此，到目前为止，目前的哲学有一个很好的方面。但是，当我要解释把我们的连续知觉结合到我们的思想或意识中的原则时，我的所有希望都消失了。我无法发现任何理论，在这个问题上让我满意。</p></div>

		<p class="block_6 en">In short there are two principles, which I cannot render consistent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz, that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple and individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them, there would be no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege of a sceptic, and confess, that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding. I pretend not, however, to pronounce it absolutely insuperable. Others, perhaps, or myself, upon more mature reflections, may discover some hypothesis, that will reconcile those contradictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">简而言之，有两个原则，我无法使它们保持一致；我也无力放弃其中任何一个，即：我们所有不同的感知都是不同的存在，而心灵从未感知到不同存在之间的任何真正联系。如果我们的知觉要么存在于某种简单而单独的东西之中，要么心灵察觉到它们之间的某种真正的联系，那么在这种情况下就没有什么困难。就我而言，我必须维护一个怀疑论者的特权，并承认这个困难对我来说太难理解了。然而，我并不是说这是绝对不能克服的。也许其他人，或者我自己，经过更成熟的思考，可能会发现一些假说，从而调和这些矛盾。</p></div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="block_6 en">I shall also take this opportunity of confessing two other errors of less importance, which more mature reflection has discovered to me in my reasoning. The first may be found in Vol. I. page 106. where I say, that the distance betwixt two bodies is known, among other things, by the angles, which the rays of light flowing from the bodies make with each other. It is certain, that these angles are not known to the mind, and consequently can never discover the distance. The second error may be found in Vol. I. page 144 where I say, that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different degrees of force and vivacity. I believe there are other differences among ideas, which cannot properly be comprehended under these terms. Had I said, that two ideas of the same object can only be different by their different feeling, I should have been nearer the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="block_6 cn">我还想借此机会承认另外两个不太重要的错误，这两个错误是我在推理过程中经过更成熟的思考发现的。第一个错误见于第一卷第106页，我说，两个物体之间的距离，除其他外，是由来自这两个物体的光线彼此形成的角度来决定的。可以肯定的是，这些角度并不为人所知，因此也就永远无法发现距离。第二个错误可以在第一卷第144页中找到，我在那里说，关于同一物体的两个观念只能因其不同程度的力量和活力而有所不同。我相信，观念之间还有其他的差异，这些差异在这些术语下是无法正确理解的。如果我说，同一物体的两个概念只能通过其不同的感觉而不同，我就会更接近事实。</p></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> We may here take occasion to observe a very remarkable error, which being frequently inculcated in the schools, has become a kind of establish'd maxim, and is universally received by all logicians. This error consists in the vulgar division of the acts of the understanding, into <i class="calibre10">conception</i>, <i class="calibre10">judgment</i> and <i class="calibre10">reasoning</i>, and in the definitions we give of them. Conception is defin'd to be the simple survey of one or more ideas: Judgment to be the separating or uniting of different ideas: Reasoning to be the separating or uniting of different ideas by the interposition of others, which show the relation they bear to each other. But these distinctions and definitions are faulty in very considerable articles. For <i class="calibre10">first</i>, 'tis far from being true, that in every judgment, which we form, we unite two different ideas; since in that proposition, <i class="calibre10">God is</i>, or indeed any other, which regards existence, the idea of existence is no distinct idea, which we unite with that of the object, and which is capable of forming a compound idea by the union. <i class="calibre10">Secondly</i>, As we can thus form a proposition, which contains only one idea, so we may exert our reason without employing more than two ideas, and without having recourse to a third to serve as a medium betwixt them. We infer a cause immediately from its effect; and this inference is not only a true species of reasoning, but the strongest of all others, and more convincing than when we interpose another idea to connect the two extremes. What we may in general affirm concerning these three acts of the understanding is, that taking them in a proper light, they all resolve themselves into the first, and are nothing but particular ways of conceiving our objects. Whether we consider a single object, or several; whether we dwell on these objects, or run from them to others; and in whatever form or order we survey them, the act of the mind exceeds not a simple conception; and the only remarkable difference, which occurs on this occasion, is, when we join belief to the conception, and are perswaded of the truth of what we conceive. This act of the mind has never yet been explain'd by any philosopher; and therefore I am at liberty to propose my hypothesis concerning it; which is, that 'tis only a strong and steady conception of any idea, and such as approaches in some measure to an immediate impression.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">在这里，我们可以借此机会观察一个非常显著的错误，这个错误在学校里经常被灌输，已经成为一种既定的格言，被所有逻辑学家普遍接受。这个错误在于把理解力的行为粗暴地分为<i class="calibre10">概念</i>、<i class="calibre10">判断</i>和<i class="calibre10">推理</i>，以及我们对它们的定义。概念被定义为对一个或多个概念的简单调查。判断是指对不同观念的分离或结合。推理是通过其他因素的介入来分离或结合不同的观念，从而显示它们之间的关系。但这些区别和定义在很大程度上是错误的。<i class="calibre10">首先</i>，在我们形成的每一个判断中，我们都把两个不同的观念结合起来，这远非事实；因为在 "<i class="calibre10">上帝是</i>"这个命题中，或者在任何其他关于存在的命题中，存在的观念并不是我们与对象的观念结合起来的独特观念，而且能够通过这种结合形成一个复合观念。<i class="calibre10">第二</i>，由于我们可以这样形成一个只包含一个观念的命题，所以我们可以在不使用两个以上的观念的情况下发挥我们的理性，也不需要借助第三个观念来作为它们之间的媒介。我们从结果中立即推断出一个原因；这种推断不仅是一种真正的推理，而且是所有其他推理中最强有力的，比我们用另一个概念来连接两个极端的时候更有说服力。关于理解力的这三种行为，我们一般可以肯定的是，从适当的角度来看，它们都会转化为第一种行为，而且只不过是构想我们的对象的特殊方式而已。无论我们是考虑一个对象，还是考虑几个对象；无论我们是停留在这些对象上，还是从这些对象转向其他对象；无论我们以何种形式或顺序来观察它们，心灵的行为都不会超过简单的概念；在这种情况下发生的唯一显著区别是，当我们把信念与概念结合起来，并被说服我们所设想的真理。任何哲学家都没有解释过心灵的这种行为；因此，我可以自由地提出我对它的假设；这就是："这只是对任何观念的一种强烈而稳定的概念，而且在某种程度上接近于一种直接的印象。</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> In general we may observe, that as our assent to all probable reasonings on the vivacity of ideas, it resembles many of those whimsies and prejudices, which are rejected under the opprobrious character of being the offspring of the imagination. By this expression it appears that the word, imagination, is commonly us'd in two different senses; and tho' nothing be more contrary to true philosophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in the following reasonings I have often been oblig'd to fall into it. When I oppose the imagination to the memory, I mean the faculty, by which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppose it to reason, I mean the same faculty, excluding only our demonstrative and probable reasonings. When I oppose it to neither, 'tis indifferent whether it be taken the larger or more limited sense, or at least the context will sufficiently explain the meaning.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">总的来说，我们可以看到，当我们同意所有关于思想活力的可能推理时，它类似于许多奇思妙想和偏见，而这些奇思妙想和偏见在想象力的后代这一令人厌恶的特性下被拒绝。通过这种表达方式可以看出，想象力这个词通常在两种不同的意义上被使用；虽然没有什么比这种不准确的说法更违背真正的哲学了，但在下面的推理中，我经常不得不陷入这种情况。当我把想象力和记忆对立起来的时候，我指的是我们形成微弱观念的能力。当我把它与理性对立起来时，我指的是同一能力，只排除我们的示范性和可能的推理。当我把它与两者都不对立的时候，无论它是被认为是更大的还是更有限的意义，都是无所谓的，至少上下文会充分地解释这个意思。</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> This reasoning, it must be confest, is somewhat abstruse, and difficult to be comprehended; but it is remarkable, that this very difficulty may be converted into a proof of the reasoning. We may observe, that there are two relations, and both of them resemblances, which contribute to our mistaking the succession of our interrupted perceptions for an identical object. The first is, the resemblance of the perceptions: The second is the resemblance, which the act of the mind in surveying a succession of resembling objects bears to that in surveying an identical object. Now these resemblances we are apt to confound with each other; and 'tis natural we shou'd, according to this very reasoning. But let us keep them distinct, and we shall find no difficulty in conceiving the precedent argument.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">必须承认，这个推理有些深奥，难以理解；但值得注意的是，这种困难可以转化为这个推理的证明。我们可以看到，有两种关系，而且都是相似的关系，这有助于我们把我们中断的知觉的连续性误认为是一个相同的对象。第一种是，感知的相似性。第二种是相似性，即心灵在观察一连串相似的物体时的行为与观察一个相同的物体时的行为是相似的。现在，我们很容易把这些相似性混为一谈；而且根据这个推理，我们自然会这样做。但是，让我们把它们区分开来，我们就会发现在理解前面的论证时没有任何困难。</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> One might think it were entirely superfluous to prove this, if a late author [Wollaston], who has had the good fortune to obtain some reputation, had not seriously affirmed, that such a falshood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may discover the fallacy of his hypothesis, we need only consider, that a false conclusion is drawn from an action, only by means of an obscurity of natural principles, which makes a cause be secretly interrupted in its operation, by contrary causes, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as alike uncertainty and variety of causes take place, even in natural objects, and produce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very essence of vice and immorality, it shou'd follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and immoral.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without liberty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not necessary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclusion, they can be, in no respect, essential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this system, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cause error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou'd in every case be inseparable.<br class="calibre3"/>Add to this, that had I had used the precaution of shutting the windows, while I indulg'd myself in those liberties with my neighbour's wife, I should have been guilty of no immorality; and that because my action, being perfectly conceal'd, wou'd have had no tendency to produce any false conclusion. For the same reason, a thief, who steals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cause no disturbance, is in no respect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv'd, or if he be, 'tis impossible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from these circumstances, take him to be other than what he really is.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis well known, that those who are squint-sighted, do very readily cause mistakes in others, and that we imagine they salute or are talking to one person, while they address themselves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral?<br class="calibre3"/>Besides, we may easily observe, that in all those arguments there is an evident reasoning in a circle. A person who takes possession of <i class="calibre10">another'</i>s goods, and uses them as his own, in a manner declares them to be his own; and this falshood is the source of the immorality of injustice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent morality?<br class="calibre3"/>A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner affirms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it because 'tis his duty to be grateful? But this supposes, that there is some antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it because human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never received any favour from the person he harm'd? But human nature is not so generally grateful, as to justify such a conclusion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every case criminal, for no other reason than because it is an exception?<br class="calibre3"/>But what may suffice entirely to destroy this whimsical system is, that it leaves us under the same difficulty to give a reason why truth is virtuous and falshood vicious, as to account for the merit or tarpitude of any other action. I shall allow, if you please, that all immorality is derived from this supposed falsehood in action, provided you can give me any plausible reason, why such a falshood is immoral. If you consider rightly of the matter, you will find yourself in the same difficulty as at the beginning.<br class="calibre3"/>This last argument is very conclusive; because, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex'd to this species of truth or falshood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, because others might possibly draw false conclusions from it? Or, who ever perform'd any, that he might give rise to true conclusions?</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">如果一位有幸获得一些声誉的已故作者[沃拉斯顿]没有严肃地断言，这种虚假是所有罪行和道德畸形的基础，人们可能会认为证明这一点完全是多余的。为了让我们发现他的假设的谬误，我们只需要考虑，从一个行动中得出一个错误的结论，只是通过自然原则的模糊性，使一个原因在其运作中被相反的原因秘密地打断，并使两个对象之间的联系变得不确定和可变。现在，由于同样的不确定性和原因的多样性，甚至在自然物体中也会发生，并在我们的判断中产生类似的错误，如果这种产生错误的趋势是罪恶和不道德的本质，那么，即使没有生命的物体也可能是邪恶和不道德的。<br class="calibre3"/>如果说无生命物体的行为没有自由和选择，这是徒劳的。因为自由和选择并不是使一个行为在我们身上产生错误结论的必要条件，所以它们在任何方面都不可能是道德的必要条件；而且我不容易看出，在这个体系中，它们是如何被视为道德的。如果导致错误的倾向是不道德的起源，那么这种倾向和不道德在任何情况下都是不可分割的。<br class="calibre3"/>此外，如果我在与邻居的妻子放纵自己的时候，采取了关窗的预防措施，我就不会犯任何不道德的罪行；这是因为我的行为被完全掩盖了，不会有产生任何错误结论的倾向。出于同样的原因，一个小偷从窗户的梯子上偷进去，并采取一切可以想象的措施，不造成任何干扰，在任何方面都不是犯罪。因为要么他不会被察觉，要么即使被察觉，他也不可能产生任何错误，也不会有人因为这些情况而认为他不是真正的人。<br class="calibre3"/>众所周知，那些斜视的人很容易使别人产生错误，我们以为他们在向一个人行礼或说话，而他们却向另一个人说话。因此，他们是否因此而不道德？<br class="calibre3"/>此外，我们可以很容易地看到，在所有这些论点中，有一个明显的循环推理。一个人如果占有<i class="calibre10">他人的</i>物品，并将其作为自己的物品使用，就会在某种程度上宣布这些物品是自己的；这种虚假性是不公正的不道德性的来源。但是，如果没有先验的道德，财产、权利或义务是可以理解的吗？<br class="calibre3"/>一个不感激他的恩人的人，在某种程度上说，他从未得到过他的任何恩惠。但是以什么方式呢？是不是因为他有责任去感恩？但这是假设，有一些责任和道德的先验规则。是不是因为人的本性一般都很感激，使我们得出结论，一个做了任何伤害的人从未得到过他所伤害的人的任何恩惠？但是，人类的天性并不像一般人那样懂得感恩，以至于可以得出这样的结论。或者说，如果是这样，那么在每一种情况下，对一般规则的例外都是犯罪，原因无非是它是一种例外吗？<br class="calibre3"/>但足以完全摧毁这个异想天开的体系的是，它让我们处于同样的困难之下，无法给出一个理由，说明为什么真理是美德而虚假是恶毒的，就像解释任何其他行为的优点或缺点一样。如果你愿意，我将允许所有的不道德行为都来自于行动中的假话，只要你能给我任何合理的理由，说明这种假话是不道德的。如果你正确地考虑这个问题，你会发现自己处于和一开始一样的困境。<br class="calibre3"/>这最后一个论点是非常确凿的；因为，如果这种真理或谬误没有明显的优点或坏处，它就不可能对我们的行为产生任何影响。因为，有谁想过因为别人有可能从中得出错误的结论而放弃任何行动？或者说，谁曾因为他可能会得出真实的结论而做过任何事情？</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> As a proof, how confus'd our way of thinking on this subject commonly is, we may observe, that those who assert, that morality is demonstrable. do not say, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are distinguishable by reason. They only say, that reason can discover such an action, in such relations, to be virtuous, and such another vicious. It seems they thought it sufficient, if they cou'd bring the word, Relation, into the proposition, without troubling themselves whether it was to the purpose or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demonstrative reason discovers only relations. But that reason, according to this hypothesis, discovers also vice and virtue. These moral qualities, therefore, must be relations. When we blame any action, in any situation, the whole complicated object, of action an situation, must form certain relations, wherein the essence of vice consists. This hypothesis is not otherwise intelligible. For what does reason discover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it discover a relation or a matter of fact? These questions are decisive, and must not be eluded.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">为了证明我们在这个问题上的思维方式通常是多么的混乱，我们可以看到，那些声称道德是可以证明的人，并没有说道德在于关系，而关系是可以通过理性来区分的。他们只是说，在这种关系中，理性可以发现这种行为是良性的，而另一种是恶性的。他们似乎认为，只要把 "关系 "这个词带入命题中就足够了，而不必纠结它是否符合目的。但我认为，这里的论证很简单。示范性的理性只发现关系。但是，根据这个假设，这个理性也发现了罪恶和美德。因此，这些道德品质，必须是关系。当我们在任何情况下指责任何行动时，整个复杂的对象，行动和情况，必须形成某些关系，其中包括恶习的本质。这个假说是无法理解的。因为当理性宣布任何行动为恶性时，它发现了什么？它发现的是一种关系还是一个事实问题？这些问题是决定性的，决不能回避。</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> No questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of causes present themselves for the same phænomenon, to determine which is the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise argument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by a kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of similar instances. Thus, in the present case, there are, no doubt, motives of public interest for most of the rules, which determine property; but still I suspect, that these rules are principally fix'd by the imagination, or the more frivolous properties of our ought and conception. I shall continue to explain these causes, leaving it to the reader's choice, whether he will prefer those deliv'd from pubick utility, or those deriv'd from the imagination. We shall begin with the right of the present possessor.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis a quality, which ((<i class="calibre10">a</i>) <i class="calibre10">Book</i> I. <i class="calibre10">Part</i> IV. <i class="calibre10">sect</i>. 5.) I have already observ'd in human nature, that when two objects appear in a close relation to each other, the mind is apt to ascribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is so strong, as often to make us run into errors (such as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can serve to that purpose. Many of our impressions are incapable of place or local position; and yet those very impressions we suppose to have a local conjunction with the impressions of sight and touch, merely because they are conjoin'd by causation, and are already united in the imagination. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an absurd one, in order to compleat any union, 'twill easily be imagin'd, that if there be any relations, which depend on the mind, 'twill readily conjoin them to any preceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, such objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for instance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place those which are <i class="calibre10">resembling</i> in <i class="calibre10">continuity</i> to each other, or at least in <i class="calibre10">correspondent</i> points of view; because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. And this is easily accounted for from the known properties o human nature. When the mind is determin'd to join certain objects, but undetermin'd in its choice of the particular objects, it naturally turns its eye to such as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They present themselves at the same time to the conception; and instead of requiring any new reason for their conjunction, it wou'd require a very powerful reason to make us over-look this natural amnity. This we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of <i class="calibre10">beauty</i>. In the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contribute to the formation of society, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession. And as property forms a relation betwixt a person and an object, 'tis natural to found it on some preceding relation; and as property is nothing but a constant possession, secur'd by the laws of society. 'tis natural to add it to the present possession, which is a relation that resembles it. For this also has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all sorts of relations, 'tis more so, to conjoin such relations as are resembling, and are related together.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 cn">哲学中最困难的问题，莫过于当一些原因出现在同一现象上时，要确定哪一个是主要的和主导的。很少有非常精确的论据来确定我们的选择，人们必须满足于通过类比和类似事例的比较，以一种品味或幻想为指导。因此，在目前的情况下，决定财产的大多数规则无疑都有公共利益的动机；但我仍然怀疑，这些规则主要是由想象力，或者我们应该和概念的更轻浮的特性所决定的。我将继续解释这些原因，让读者自己选择，他是喜欢那些由公共效用产生的原因，还是那些由想象力产生的原因。我们将从目前拥有者的权利开始。<br class="calibre3"/>这是一种品质，（<i class="calibre10">（a</i>）<i class="calibre10">第一册</i>第四<i class="calibre10">部分</i>。5.)我已经在人性中观察到，当两个物体出现在彼此的密切关系中时，心灵很容易赋予它们任何额外的关系，以便完成结合；这种倾向是如此强烈，以至于如果我们发现它们可以达到这个目的，就常常使我们陷入错误（例如思想和物质的结合）。我们的许多印象是没有地点或局部位置的；然而这些印象我们却认为与视觉和触觉的印象有局部的结合，只是因为它们是通过因果关系结合在一起的，并且已经在想象中结合在一起。因此，既然我们可以假装一种新的关系，甚至是一种荒谬的关系，以完成任何结合，那么就很容易想象到，如果有任何关系，取决于心灵，它就会很容易地把它们与前面的任何关系结合起来，并通过一种新的纽带，把那些在想象中已经有结合的对象结合起来。例如，我们在安排身体的时候，从来都会把那些在<i class="calibre10">连续性</i>上<i class="calibre10">相似的</i>物体放在一起，或者至少放在<i class="calibre10">相应的</i>位置上；因为我们在把毗连关系和相似关系结合起来的时候感到很满意，或者把情况的相似性和质量的相似性结合起来。这一点很容易从人性的已知属性中得到解释。当心智决定要把某些对象结合起来，但在选择特定对象时却不确定，它自然会把目光转向那些有关联的对象。它们已经在头脑中结合起来了。它们同时呈现在概念中；与其说需要任何新的理由将它们结合起来，不如说需要一个非常强大的理由来使我们忽视这种自然的一致性。这一点，我们将在以后讨论<i class="calibre10">美时</i>，有机会更充分地加以解释。同时，我们可以满足于这样的观察：同样对秩序和统一的热爱，使图书馆的书和客厅的椅子得到了安排，通过修改有关财产稳定性的一般规则，有助于社会的形成和人类的福祉。由于财产在人与物之间形成了一种关系，因此很自然地把它建立在前面的某种关系之上；由于财产只不过是一种持续的占有，受到社会法律的保障。把它加到目前的占有上是很自然的，而目前的占有是一种类似于它的关系。因为这也有其影响。如果把各种关系联系在一起是自然的，那么把类似的关系联系在一起就更自然了，而且是相互关联的。</p></dd></dl></div>

		<p class="block_12 en"> If we seek a solution of these difficulties in reason and public interest, we never shall find satisfaction; and if we look for it in the imagination, 'tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty, run so insensibly and gradually into each other, that 'tis impossible to give them any precise bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head must encrease, when we consider, that our judgment alters very sensibly, according to the subject, and that the same power and proximity will be deem'd possession in one case, which is not esteem'd such in another. A person, who has hunted a hare to the last degree of weariness, wou`d look upon it as an injustice for another to rush in before him, and seize his prey. But the same person, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within reach, has no reason to complain, ' another, more alert, passes him, and takes possession. What is the reason of this difference, but that immobility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of industry, forms that ease a strong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other?<br class="calibre3"/>Here then it a pears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or some other sensible relation, often, produces not property: And I farther observe, that a sensible relation, without any present power, is sometimes sufficient to give a title to any object. The sight of a thing is seldom a considerable relation, and is only regarded as such, when the object is hidden, or very obscure; in which case we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, <i class="calibre10">that even a whole continent belongs to the nation, which first discover'd it</i>. 'Tis however remarkable, that both in the cue of discovery and that of possession, the first discoverer and possessor must join to the relation and intention of rendering himself proprietor, otherwise the relation will not have its effect; and that because the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not so great, but that it requires to be held by such an intention.<br class="calibre3"/>From all these circumstances, 'tis easy to see how perplex'd many qestions may become concerning the acquisition of property by occupation; and the least effort of thought may present us with instances, which are not susceptible of any reasonable decision. If we prefer examples, which are real, to such as are feign'd, we may consider the following one, which is to be met with in almost every writer, that has treated of the laws of nature. Two <i class="calibre10">Grecian</i> colonies, leaving their native country, in search of new seats, were inform'd that a city near them was deserted by its inhabitants. To know the truth ot' this report, they dispatch'd at once two messengers, one from each colony; who finding on their approach, that their information was true, begun a race together with an intention to take possession of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of these messengers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch'd his spear at the gates of the city, and was so fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc'd a dispute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this dispute still subsists among philosophers. For my part, I find the dispute impossible to be decided, and that because the whole question hangs upon the fancy, which in this case is not possess'd of any precise or determinate standard, upon which it can give sentence. To make this evident, let us consider, that if these two persons had been simply members of the colonies, and not messengers or deputies, their actions wou'd not have been of any consequence; since in that ease their relation to the colonies wou'd have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin'd them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the most obvious and remarkable part, satisfy the fancy best in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Besides we may consider, that the touch or contact of the one messenger is not properly possession, no more than the piercing the gates wi a spear; but only forms a relation; and there is a relation, in the other case, equally obvious. tho' not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of these relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be sufficient for that effect, I leave to the decision of such as are wiser than myself.</p></dd></dl>

		<p class="block_12 en"> This source of property can never explain'd but from the imaginations; and one may affirm, that the causes are here unmix'd. We shall proceed to explain them more particularly, and illustrate them by examples from common life and experience.<br class="calibre3"/>It been observ'd above, that the mind has a natural propensity to join relations, especially resembling ones, and finds a kind of fitness and uniformity in such a union. From this propensity are deriv'd these laws of nature, <i class="calibre10">that upon the first formation of society, property always follows the present possession;</i> and afterwards, <i class="calibre10">that it arises from first or from long possession</i>. Now we may easily observe, that relation is not confin'd merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other object which is related to it, and so on, till the thought loses the chain by too long a progress. However the relation may weaken by each remove, 'tis not immediately destroy'd; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of such force as to give rise to the right of <i class="calibre10">accession</i>, and causes us to acquire the property not only of such objects as we are immediately possess'd of, but also of such as are closely connected with them.<br class="calibre3"/>Suppose a <i class="calibre10">German</i>, a <i class="calibre10">Frenchman</i>, and a <i class="calibre10">Spaniard</i> to come into a room, where there are plac'd upon the table three bottles of wine, <i class="calibre10">Rhenish, Burgundy</i> and <i class="calibre10">Port</i>; and suppose they shou'd fall a quarrelling about the division of them; a person, who was chosen for umpire, wou'd naturally, to shew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own country: And this from a principle, which, in some measure, is the source of those laws of nature, that ascribe property to occupation, prescription and accession.<br class="calibre3"/>In all these cases, and particularly that of accession, there is first a natural union betwixt the idea of the person and that of the object, and afterward a new and <i class="calibre10">moral</i> union produc'd by that right or property, which we ascribe to the person. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that singular method of reasoning, which has been employ'd on the present subject. I have already observ'd, that the imagination passes with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the transition of ideas is always easier and smoother in the former use than in the latter. Now as the right of accession arises from the easy transition of ideas, by which relates objects are connected together, it shou'd naturally be imagin'd, that the right of accession must encrease in strength, in proportion as the transition of ideas is perform'd with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir'd the property of any small object, we shall readily consider any great object related to it as an accession, and as belonging to the proprietor of the small one; hence the transition is in that case very easy from the small object to the great one, and shou'd connect them together in the closest manner. But in fact the case is always found to be otherwise. The empire of <i class="calibre10">Great Britain</i> seems to draw along with it the dominion of the <i class="calibre10">Orkneys</i>, the <i class="calibre10">Hebrides</i>, the isle of <i class="calibre10">Man</i>, and the isle of <i class="calibre10">Wight</i>; but the authority over those lesser islands does not naturally imply any title to <i class="calibre10">Great Britain</i>. In short, a small object naturally follows a great one as its accession; but a great one is never suppos'd to belong to the proprietor of a small one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter case the transition of ideas is smoother from the proprietor to the small object, which is his property, and from the small object to the great one, than in the former case from the proprietor to the great object, and from the great one to the small. It may therefore be thought, that these phænomena are objections to the foregoing hypothesis, <i class="calibre10">that the ascribing of property to accession it nothing but an effect of the relations of ideas, and of the smooth transition of the imagination</i>.<br class="calibre3"/>'Twill be easy to solve this objection, if we consider the agility and unsteadiness of the imagination, with the different views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a person a property in two objects, we do not always pass from the person to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be consider`d as the property of the person, we are apt to join them together, and place them in the same light. Suppose, therefore, a great and a small object to be related together; if a person be strongly related to the great object, he will likewise be strongly related to both the objects, consider'd together, because he is related to the most considerable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the small object, he will not be strongly related to both, consider'd together, since his relation lies only with the most trivial part, which is not apt to strike us in any great degree, when we consider the whole. And this is the reason, why small objects become accessions to great ones, and not great to small.<br class="calibre3"/>'Tis the general opinion of philosophers and civilians, that the sea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that because 'tis impossible to take possession of it, or form any such distinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this reason ceases, property immediately takes place. Thus the most strenuous advocates for the liberty of the seas universally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an accession to the proprietors of the surrounding continent. These have properly no more ground or union with the land, than the <i class="calibre10">pacific</i> ocean wou'd have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the sane time <i class="calibre10">inferior</i>, they are of course regarded as an accession.<br class="calibre3"/>The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the <i class="calibre10">Rhine</i> or the <i class="calibre10">Danube</i>, which seem too large to the imagination to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are considered as the property of that nation, thru' whose dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy.<br class="calibre3"/>The accessions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided it be made by what they call <i class="calibre10">alluvion</i>, that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances that mightily assist the imagination in the conjunction. Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank, and join'd to another, it becomes not his property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not sufficiently join them.<br class="calibre3"/>There are other cases, which somewhat resemble this of accession, but which, at the bottom, are considerably different, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different persons, after such a manner as not to admit of <i class="calibre10">separation</i>. The question is, to whom the united mass must belong.<br class="calibre3"/>Where this conjunction is of such a nature as to admit of <i class="calibre10">division</i>, but not of <i class="calibre10">separation</i>, the decision is natural and easy. The whole mass must be suppos'd to be common betwixt the proprietors of the several parts and afterwards must be divided according to the proportions of these parts. But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable subtilty of the Roman law, in distinguishing betwixt <i class="calibre10">confusion</i> and <i class="calibre10">commixtion</i>. Confusion is an union of two bodies, such as different liquors, where the parts become entirely undistinguishable. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, such as two bushels of corn, where the parts remain separate in an obvious and visible manner. As in the latter case the imagination discovers not so entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and preserve a distinct idea of the property of each; this is the reason, why the <i class="calibre10">civil</i> law, tho' it establish'd an entire community in the case of <i class="calibre10">confusion</i>, and after that a proportional division, yet in the case of <i class="calibre10">commixtion</i>, supposes each of the proprietors to maintain a distinct right; however necessity may at last force them to submit to the same division.<br class="calibre3"/><i class="calibre10">Quod si frementum Titii frumento tuo mistum fuerit: siquidem ex voluntale vestra, commune est: quia singula corpora, id est, singula grana, quæ cujusque propria fuerunt, ex consensu vestro communicata sunt. Quod si casu id mistrum fuerit, vel Titius id miscuerit sine tua voluntate, non videtur id commune esse; quia singula corpora in sua substantia durant. Sed nec magis istis casibus commune sit frumentum quam grex intelligitur esse communis, si pecora Titii tuis pecoribus mista fuerint. Sed si ab alterutro vestrûm totum id frumentum retineatur, in rem quidem actio pro modo frumenti cujusquem competit. Arbitrio autem judicis, ut ipse æstimet quale cujusque frumentum fuerit.</i> Inst. Lib. II. Tit. 1. § 28.<br class="calibre3"/>Where the properties of two persons are united after such a manner as neither to admit of <i class="calibre10">division</i> nor <i class="calibre10">separation</i>, as when one builds a house on another's ground, in that case, the whole must belong to one of the proprietors: And here I assert, that it naturally is conceiv'd to belong to the proprietor of the most considerable For however the compound object may have a relation to two different persons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the most considerable part principally engages our attention, and by the strict union draws the inferior along it; for this reason, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we shall be pleas'd to call the most considerable part, and most attractive to the imagination.<br class="calibre3"/>This quality depends on several different circumstances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more considerable than another, either because it is more constant and durable; because it is of greater value; because it is more obvious and remarkable; because it is of greater extent; or because its existence is more separate and independent. 'Twill be easy to conceive, that, as these circumstances may be conjoin'd and oppos'd in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be imagin'd, there will result many cases, where the reasons on both sides are so equally ballanc'd, that 'tis impossible for us to give any satisfactory decision. Here then is the proper business of municipal laws, to what the principles of human nature have left undetermin'd.<br class="calibre3"/>The superficies yields to the soil, says the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. These decisions do not well agree together, and a proof of the contrariety of those principles, from which they are deriv'd.<br class="calibre3"/>But of all the questions of this kind the most curious is that, which for so many ages divided the disciples of <i class="calibre10">Proculus</i> and <i class="calibre10">Sabinus</i>. Suppose a person shou'd make a cup from the metal of another, or a ship from his wood, and suppose the proprietor of the metal or wood shou'd demand his goods, the question is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or ship. <i class="calibre10">Sabinus</i> maintain'd the affirmative, and asserted that the substance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore superior to the form, which is casual and dependent. On the other hand, <i class="calibre10">Proculus</i> observ'd, that the form is the most obvious and remarkable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular species. To which he might have added, that the matter or substance is in most bodies so fluctuating and uncertain, that 'tis utterly impossible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles such a controversy can be certainly determin'd. I shall therefore content my self with observing, that the decision of <i class="calibre10">Trebonian</i> seems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, because it can be brought back to its first form: But that the ship belongs to the author of its form for a contrary reason. But however ingenious this reason may seem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the possibility of such a reduction, finds a closer connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a ship and the proprietor of its wood, where the substance is more fix'd and unalterable.</p></dd></dl>

Suppose that a person die without children, and that a dispute arises among is relations conceding his inheritance; 'tis evident, that if his riches be deriv'd partly from his father, partly from his mother, the most natural way of determining such a dispute, is, to divide his possessions, and assign each part to the family, from whence it is deriv'd.

		<p class="block_12 en"> Love and esteem are at the bottom the same passions, and arise from like causes. The qualities, that produce both, are agreeable, and give pleasure. But where this pleasure is severe and serious; or when its object is great, and makes a strong impression; or where it produces any degree of humility and awe: In all these cases, the passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly denominated esteem than love.
