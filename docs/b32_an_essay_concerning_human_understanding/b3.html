		<p class="calibre5 en">This Treatise, which is grown up under your lordship’s eye, and has ventured into the world by your order, does now, by a natural kind of right, come to your lordship for that protection which you several years since promised it. It is not that I think any name, how great soever, set at the beginning of a book, will be able to cover the faults that are to be found in it. Things in print must stand and fall by their own worth, or the reader’s fancy. But there being nothing more to be desired for truth than a fair unprejudiced hearing, nobody is more likely to procure me that than your lordship, who are allowed to have got so intimate an acquaintance with her, in her more retired recesses. Your lordship is known to have so far advanced your speculations in the most abstract and general knowledge of things, beyond the ordinary reach or common methods, that your allowance and approbation of the design of this Treatise will at least preserve it from being condemned without reading, and will prevail to have those parts a little weighed, which might otherwise perhaps be thought to deserve no consideration, for being somewhat out of the common road. The imputation of Novelty is a terrible charge amongst those who judge of men’s heads, as they do of their perukes, by the fashion, and can allow none to be right but the received doctrines. Truth scarce ever yet carried it by vote anywhere at its first appearance: new opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not already common. But truth, like gold, is not the less so for being newly brought out of the mine. It is trial and examination must give it price, and not any antique fashion; and though it be not yet current by the public stamp, yet it may, for all that, be as old as nature, and is certainly not the less genuine. Your lordship can give great and convincing instances of this, whenever you please to oblige the public with some of those large and comprehensive discoveries you have made of truths hitherto unknown, unless to some few, from whom your lordship has been pleased not wholly to conceal them. This alone were a sufficient reason, were there no other, why I should dedicate this Essay to your lordship; and its having some little correspondence with some parts of that nobler and vast system of the sciences your lordship has made so new, exact, and instructive a draught of, I think it glory enough, if your lordship permit me to boast, that here and there I have fallen into some thoughts not wholly different from yours. If your lordship think fit that, by your encouragement, this should appear in the world, I hope it may be a reason, some time or other, to lead your lordship further; and you will allow me to say, that you here give the world an earnest of something that, if they can bear with this, will be truly worth their expectation. This, my lord, shows what a present I here make to your lordship; just such as the poor man does to his rich and great neighbour, by whom the basket of flowers or fruit is not ill taken, though he has more plenty of his own growth, and in much greater perfection. Worthless things receive a value when they are made the offerings of respect, esteem, and gratitude: these you have given me so mighty and peculiar reasons to have, in the highest degree, for your lordship, that if they can add a price to what they go along with, proportionable to their own greatness, I can with confidence brag, I here make your lordship the richest present you ever received. This I am sure, I am under the greatest obligations to seek all occasions to acknowledge a long train of favours I have received from your lordship; favours, though great and important in themselves, yet made much more so by the forwardness, concern, and kindness, and other obliging circumstances, that never failed to accompany them. To all this you are pleased to add that which gives yet more weight and relish to all the rest: you vouchsafe to continue me in some degrees of your esteem, and allow me a place in your good thoughts, I had almost said friendship. This, my lord, your words and actions so constantly show on all occasions, even to others when I am absent, that it is not vanity in me to mention what everybody knows: but it would be want of good manners not to acknowledge what so many are witnesses of, and every day tell me I am indebted to your lordship for. I wish they could as easily assist my gratitude, as they convince me of the great and growing engagements it has to your lordship. This I am sure, I should write of the UNDERSTANDING without having any, if I were not extremely sensible of them, and did not lay hold on this opportunity to testify to the world how much I am obliged to be, and how much I am,</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这篇论文是在您的关注下成长起来的，并在您的命令下冒险进入了这个世界，现在，根据一种自然的权利，它来到您的身边，寻求您几年前承诺的保护。我不认为任何名字，无论多么伟大，放在一本书的开头，就能掩盖其中的缺点。印刷品必须以其自身的价值或读者的喜好来决定其成败。但是，对于真理来说，没有什么比一个公平的、没有偏见的听证会更值得期待的了，没有人比老爷更有可能为我争取到这一点，因为老爷被允许在她比较隐蔽的地方与她有过如此亲密的接触。众所周知，老爷对事物最抽象、最普遍的知识的推测已经有了很大的进展，超出了一般的范围或普通的方法，所以你对这篇论文的设计的允许和赞同，至少会使它不至于不经阅读就被谴责，而且会使那些可能被认为不值得考虑的部分稍加权衡，因为它们有些不符合常理。对新事物的指责在那些以时尚来判断人的头脑的人中是很可怕的，除了公认的教义，他们不允许有任何正确的东西。真理第一次出现时，几乎没有人通过投票把它带到任何地方：新的观点总是被怀疑，而且通常被反对，没有任何其他原因，只是因为它们还不普遍。但是，真理就像黄金一样，并不因为刚从矿井中出来而有所减少。它的价格是由试验和检验决定的，而不是由任何古老的时尚决定的；尽管它还没有被公众认可，但它可能和自然界一样古老，而且肯定不会更不真实。只要您愿意向公众介绍您对迄今为止不为人知的真理的一些重大而全面的发现，您就可以提供大量令人信服的例子，除非是对少数人，而您的主人并不愿意完全隐瞒它们。如果没有其他原因，仅此一点就足以让我把这篇论文献给老爷；它与老爷的那套更高尚、更庞大的科学体系中的某些部分有一些对应关系，老爷对其进行了如此新颖、准确和富有启发性的起草，如果老爷允许我夸口，我认为这已经很光荣了，我在这里和那里都陷入了一些与你不完全相同的想法。如果大人认为，在您的鼓励下，这应该出现在世界上，我希望这可以成为一个理由，在某个时候，引导大人进一步发展；您可以允许我说，您在这里给了世界一个预言，如果他们能忍受这个，将真正值得他们期待。大人，这说明我在这里给大人的礼物是什么；就像穷人给他的富人和大邻居的礼物一样，他的花篮或水果不会被人嫌弃，尽管他自己有更多的东西，而且更完美。不值钱的东西在被作为尊重、敬重和感激的祭品时就有了价值：你给了我如此强大和特殊的理由，让我在最高程度上为你的主人拥有这些东西，如果它们能给它们的东西增加一个价格，与它们本身的伟大相称，我可以自信地吹嘘，我在这里给你的主人带来了你所收到的最丰富的礼物。我确信，我有最大的义务寻求一切机会承认我从大人那里得到的一长串恩惠；这些恩惠虽然本身是巨大而重要的，但由于伴随着这些恩惠而来的远见卓识、关心和善意，以及其他令人感激的情况，使其更加重要。对于这一切，您还高兴地加上一句话，这句话给所有其他的事情带来了更大的分量和回味：您允许我继续受到您的某种程度的尊敬，并允许我在您的美好想法中占有一席之地，我几乎可以说是友谊。这一点，大人，您的言行在任何场合都不断地显示出来，甚至在我不在的时候也是如此，所以我提一下大家都知道的事情并不是虚荣心，但如果不承认这么多人见证的事情，并且每天都告诉我我对大人有恩，那就是没有礼貌了。我希望他们能帮助我表达感激之情，因为他们让我相信我对老爷的承诺是巨大的、不断增长的。我相信，如果我不是非常了解这些，我应该在没有任何了解的情况下写下UNDERSTANDING，而不是抓住这个机会向全世界证明我有多么的感激，以及我有多么的。</p>

If it has the good luck to prove so of any of thine, and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as I had in writing it, thou wilt as little think thy money, as I do my pains, ill bestowed. Mistake not this for a commendation of my work; nor conclude, because I was pleased with the doing of it, that therefore I am fondly taken with it now it is done. He that hawks at larks and sparrows has no less sport, though a much less considerable quarry, than he that flies at nobler game: and he is little acquainted with the subject of this treatise—the UNDERSTANDING—who does not know that, as it is the most elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth are a sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a great part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress towards Knowledge makes some discovery, which is not only new, but the best too, for the time at least.</p>

Thus he who has raised himself above the alms-basket, and, not content to live lazily on scraps of begged opinions, sets his own thoughts on work, to find and follow truth, will (whatever he lights on) not miss the hunter’s satisfaction; every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with some delight; and he will have reason to think his time not ill spent, even when he cannot much boast of any great acquisition.</p>

It is to them, if they are thy own, that I refer myself: but if they are taken upon trust from others, it is no great matter what they are; they are not following truth, but some meaner consideration; and it is not worth while to be concerned what he says or thinks, who says or thinks only as he is directed by another. If thou judgest for thyself I know thou wilt judge candidly, and then I shall not be harmed or offended, whatever be thy censure. For though it be certain that there is nothing in this Treatise of the truth whereof I am not fully persuaded, yet I consider myself as liable to mistakes as I can think thee, and know that this book must stand or fall with thee, not by any opinion I have of it, but thy own. If thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee, thou art not to blame me for it.

		<p class="calibre5 en">Were it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should tell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities, and see what OBJECTS our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all readily assented; and thereupon it was agreed that this should be our first inquiry. Some hasty and undigested thoughts, on a subject I had never before considered, which I set down against our next meeting, gave the first entrance into this Discourse; which having been thus begun by chance, was continued by intreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and after long intervals of neglect, resumed again, as my humour or occasions permitted; and at last, in a retirement where an attendance on my health gave me leisure, it was brought into that order thou now seest it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This discontinued way of writing may have occasioned, besides others, two contrary faults, viz., that too little and too much may be said in it. If thou findest anything wanting, I shall be glad that what I have written gives thee any desire that I should have gone further. If it seems too much to thee, thou must blame the subject; for when I put pen to paper, I thought all I should have to say on this matter would have been contained in one sheet of paper; but the further I went the larger prospect I had; new discoveries led me still on, and so it grew insensibly to the bulk it now appears in. I will not deny, but possibly it might be reduced to a narrower compass than it is, and that some parts of it might be contracted, the way it has been writ in, by catches, and many long intervals of interruption, being apt to cause some repetitions. But to confess the truth, I am now too lazy, or too busy, to make it shorter. I am not ignorant how little I herein consult my own reputation, when I knowingly let it go with a fault, so apt to disgust the most judicious, who are always the nicest readers. But they who know sloth is apt to content itself with any excuse, will pardon me if mine has prevailed on me, where I think I have a very good one. I will not therefore allege in my defence, that the same notion, having different respects, may be convenient or necessary to prove or illustrate several parts of the same discourse, and that so it has happened in many parts of this: but waiving that, I shall frankly avow that I have sometimes dwelt long upon the same argument, and expressed it different ways, with a quite different design. I pretend not to publish this Essay for the information of men of large thoughts and quick apprehensions; to such masters of knowledge I profess myself a scholar, and therefore warn them beforehand not to expect anything here, but what, being spun out of my own coarse thoughts, is fitted to men of my own size, to whom, perhaps, it will not be unacceptable that I have taken some pains to make plain and familiar to their thoughts some truths which established prejudice, or the abstractedness of the ideas themselves, might render difficult. Some objects had need be turned on every side; and when the notion is new, as I confess some of these are to me; or out of the ordinary road, as I suspect they will appear to others, it is not one simple view of it that will gain it admittance into every understanding, or fix it there with a clear and lasting impression. There are few, I believe, who have not observed in themselves or others, that what in one way of proposing was very obscure, another way of expressing it has made very clear and intelligible; though afterwards the mind found little difference in the phrases, and wondered why one failed to be understood more than the other. But everything does not hit alike upon every man’s imagination. We have our understandings no less different than our palates; and he that thinks the same truth shall be equally relished by every one in the same dress, may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort of cookery: the meat may be the same, and the nourishment good, yet every one not be able to receive it with that seasoning; and it must be dressed another way, if you will have it go down with some, even of strong constitutions. The truth is, those who advised me to publish it, advised me, for this reason, to publish it as it is: and since I have been brought to let it go abroad, I desire it should be understood by whoever gives himself the pains to read it. I have so little affection to be in print, that if I were not flattered this Essay might be of some use to others, as I think it has been to me, I should have confined it to the view of some friends, who gave the first occasion to it. My appearing therefore in print being on purpose to be as useful as I may, I think it necessary to make what I have to say as easy and intelligible to all sorts of readers as I can. And I had much rather the speculative and quick-sighted should complain of my being in some parts tedious, than that any one, not accustomed to abstract speculations, or prepossessed with different notions, should mistake or not comprehend my meaning.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这种不连续的写作方式，除了其他原因外，可能还造成了两个相反的缺点，即：其中可能说得太少和太多。如果你发现有什么不足，我会很高兴我写的东西能让你希望我再进一步。如果你觉得太多，你必须责备这个问题；因为当我提笔写的时候，我认为我在这个问题上要讲的所有内容都会包含在一张纸上；但我越往前走，我的前景就越大；新的发现使我继续前进，所以它不由自主地发展到现在的规模。我不否认，它可能会被缩减到比现在更窄的范围内，它的某些部分可能会被收缩，它的写作方式，通过抓取，以及许多长时间的中断，很容易造成一些重复的内容。但要承认事实，我现在太懒了，或者说太忙了，无法使其缩短。我不是不知道，当我明知故犯地放任自己的错误时，我对自己的名声是多么的不屑一顾，因为这很容易让最有判断力的人感到厌恶，而他们总是最优秀的读者。但是，他们知道懒惰容易满足于任何借口，如果我的借口占了上风，请原谅我，我认为我有一个非常好的借口。因此，我不会在我的辩护中说，同一个概念，有不同的方面，可能方便或需要证明或说明同一论述的几个部分，而且这篇文章的许多部分都是如此：但放弃这一点，我将坦率地承认，我有时在同一个论点上花了很长时间，并以不同的方式表达它，但目的完全不同。我假装不是为了让那些思想深刻、理解力强的人了解这篇论文；对于这样的知识大师，我自称是个学者，因此事先警告他们，不要指望这里有什么东西，而是从我自己的粗浅思想中提炼出来的、适合我这样的人的东西，对他们来说，也许我花了一些功夫让他们的思想明白和熟悉一些真理，而这些真理的既定偏见或思想本身的抽象性可能会使他们难以接受。有些对象需要从每一个方面来考虑；当概念是新的，就像我承认其中一些概念对我来说是新的；或者是超出常规的，就像我怀疑它们在其他人看来是新的一样，不是一个简单的观点就能让它进入每个人的理解，或者以清晰而持久的印象将它固定在那里。我相信，很少有人没有在自己或他人身上看到，以一种方式提出的东西非常晦涩难懂，而以另一种方式表达的东西却非常清晰易懂；尽管事后人们发现这些短语没有什么不同，并想知道为什么一个人比另一个人更难理解。但是，每个人的想象力都不尽相同。我们的理解力不亚于我们的味觉；如果他认为每个人都能以同样的方式享受同样的真理，那么他就可能希望以同样的烹饪方式来款待每个人：肉可能是一样的，营养也很好，但不是每个人都能接受这种调料；如果你想让一些人，甚至是强壮的人接受它，就必须以另一种方式来打扮它。事实是，那些建议我出版这本书的人，因为这个原因，建议我按原样出版：既然我已经被带到国外，我希望不管是谁，只要花心思去读它，就应该理解它。我对印刷品没有什么好感，如果我不是因为这篇文章对别人有帮助而感到高兴，就像我认为它对我有帮助一样，我应该把它限制在一些朋友的视野中，是他们给了我这个机会。因此，我出现在印刷品中的目的是为了尽可能地发挥作用，我认为有必要使我要讲的东西对各种读者都尽可能地容易理解。我宁可让那些善于猜测、目光敏锐的人抱怨我在某些地方很乏味，也不愿让那些不习惯于抽象猜测、或对不同概念有偏好的人误解或不理解我的意思。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">It will possibly be censured as a great piece of vanity or insolence in me, to pretend to instruct this our knowing age; it amounting to little less, when I own, that I publish this Essay with hopes it may be useful to others. But, if it may be permitted to speak freely of those who with a feigned modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write, methinks it savours much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book for any other end; and he fails very much of that respect he owes the public, who prints, and consequently expects men should read, that wherein he intends not they should meet with anything of use to themselves or others: and should nothing else be found allowable in this Treatise, yet my design will not cease to be so; and the goodness of my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my present. It is that chiefly which secures me from the fear of censure, which I expect not to escape more than better writers. Men’s principles, notions, and relishes are so different, that it is hard to find a book which pleases or displeases all men. I acknowledge the age we live in is not the least knowing, and therefore not the most easy to be satisfied. If I have not the good luck to please, yet nobody ought to be offended with me. I plainly tell all my readers, except half a dozen, this Treatise was not at first intended for them; and therefore they need not be at the trouble to be of that number. But yet if any one thinks fit to be angry and rail at it, he may do it securely, for I shall find some better way of spending my time than in such kind of conversation. I shall always have the satisfaction to have aimed sincerely at truth and usefulness, though in one of the meanest ways. The commonwealth of learning is not at this time without master-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will leave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but every one must not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces such masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton, with some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed as an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge;—which certainly had been very much more advanced in the world, if the endeavours of ingenious and industrious men had not been much cumbered with the learned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected, or unintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made an art of, to that degree that Philosophy, which is nothing but the true knowledge of things, was thought unfit or incapable to be brought into well-bred company and polite conversation. Vague and insignificant forms of speech, and abuse of language, have so long passed for mysteries of science; and hard and misapplied words, with little or no meaning, have, by prescription, such a right to be mistaken for deep learning and height of speculation, that it will not be easy to persuade either those who speak or those who hear them, that they are but the covers of ignorance, and hindrance of true knowledge. To break in upon the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be, I suppose, some service to human understanding; though so few are apt to think they deceive or are deceived in the use of words; or that the language of the sect they are of has any faults in it which ought to be examined or corrected, that I hope I shall be pardoned if I have in the Third Book dwelt long on this subject, and endeavoured to make it so plain, that neither the inveterateness of the mischief, nor the prevalency of the fashion, shall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the meaning of their own words, and will not suffer the significancy of their expressions to be inquired into.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我可能会被指责为一种巨大的虚荣心或无礼，假装要指导我们这个充满智慧的时代；当我承认我出版这篇论文是希望它对其他人有用时，这也算不上什么。但是，如果允许我们随意谈论那些假装谦虚地谴责他们自己写的东西毫无用处的人，我认为为任何其他目的出版一本书更有虚荣或无礼的味道；他非常不尊重他欠公众的那份尊重，因为他印刷并因此希望人们阅读，他不打算让他们遇到对自己或他人有用的东西。如果在这篇论述中没有发现其他可允许的东西，但我的设计不会停止；我的意图的良好性应该成为我目前的无价值的一些借口。主要是这一点使我免于受到指责的恐惧，我期望比更好的作家更能逃脱这种指责。人们的原则、观念和爱好是如此不同，以至于很难找到一本让所有的人都高兴或不高兴的书。我承认我们所处的时代不是最不了解的，因此也不是最容易满足的。如果我没有好运气去取悦别人，但也不应该得罪我。我明确地告诉我的所有读者，除了半打以外，这篇论文最初不是为他们准备的；因此，他们不需要费心去做这个数字。但是，如果有人认为适合对它进行愤怒和抨击，他可以放心地这样做，因为我将找到比这种谈话更好的方式来打发我的时间。我将永远感到满意，因为我真诚地追求真理和有用的东西，尽管是以一种最卑微的方式。在这个时代，学术界并非没有大师级的建设者，他们在推动科学发展方面的伟大设计将为后人留下永恒的纪念碑：但每个人都不能指望成为波义耳或西登纳姆；在这个时代，产生了像伟大的惠根尼斯和无可比拟的先生这样的大师。牛顿等大师的时代，能作为一个底层劳动者受雇于人，稍微清理一下地面，清除一些阻碍知识的垃圾，已经是很有志气了。如果聪明和勤劳的人的努力没有被学识渊博但轻率地使用不雅观、受影响或难以理解的术语所困扰，这些术语被引入科学，并在那里成为一种艺术，以至于哲学--除了对事物的真正了解--被认为不适合或不能够被带入有教养的公司和礼貌的谈话，那么世界上肯定会有更大的进步。模糊而无意义的言语形式，以及对语言的滥用，长期以来一直被当作科学的奥秘；而生硬而误用的词语，几乎没有任何意义，根据规定，有权利被误认为是深刻的学问和推测的高度，以至于不容易说服那些说话的人或听话的人，他们只是无知的幌子，阻碍真正的知识。闯入虚荣和无知的圣殿，我想对人类的理解会有一些帮助；尽管很少有人会认为他们在用词上会欺骗或被欺骗。我希望我在第三本书中对这一问题进行了长时间的讨论，并努力使它变得如此简单，以至于无论这种弊端的顽固性，还是这种时尚的盛行，都不能成为那些不注意自己话语的含义，不愿意让人探究其表达的意义的人的借口，我会得到原谅的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">I have been told that a short Epitome of this Treatise, which was printed in 1688, was by some condemned without reading, because INNATE IDEAS were denied in it; they too hastily concluding, that if innate ideas were not supposed, there would be little left either of the notion or proof of spirits. If any one take the like offence at the entrance of this Treatise, I shall desire him to read it through; and then I hope he will be convinced, that the taking away false foundations is not to the prejudice but advantage of truth, which is never injured or endangered so much as when mixed with, or built on, falsehood.

Upon a closer inspection into the working of men’s minds, and a stricter examination of those motives and views they are turned by, I have found reason somewhat to alter the thoughts I formerly had concerning that which gives the last determination to the Will in all voluntary actions. This I cannot forbear to acknowledge to the world with as much freedom and readiness; as I at first published what then seemed to me to be right; thinking myself more concerned to quit and renounce any opinion of my own, than oppose that of another, when truth appears against it. For it is truth alone I seek, and that will always be welcome to me, when or from whencesoever it comes. But what forwardness soever I have to resign any opinion I have, or to recede from anything I have writ, upon the first evidence of any error in it; yet this I must own, that I have not had the good luck to receive any light from those exceptions I have met with in print against any part of my book, nor have, from anything that has been urged against it, found reason to alter my sense in any of the points that have been questioned. Whether the subject I have in hand requires often more thought and attention than cursory readers, at least such as are prepossessed, are willing to allow; or whether any obscurity in my expressions casts a cloud over it, and these notions are made difficult to others’ apprehensions in my way of treating them; so it is, that my meaning, I find, is often mistaken, and I have not the good luck to be everywhere rightly understood.</p>

For the civility of his expressions, and the candour that belongs to his order, forbid me to think that he would have closed his Preface with an insinuation, as if in what I had said, Book II. ch. xxvii, concerning the third rule which men refer their actions to, I went about to make virtue vice and vice virtue, unless he had mistaken my meaning; which he could not have done if he had given himself the trouble to consider what the argument was I was then upon, and what was the chief design of that chapter, plainly enough set down in the fourth section and those following. For I was there not laying down moral rules, but showing the original and nature of moral ideas, and enumerating the rules men make use of in moral relations, whether these rules were true or false: and pursuant thereto I tell what is everywhere called virtue and vice; which “alters not the nature of things,” though men generally do judge of and denominate their actions according to the esteem and fashion of the place and sect they are of.</p>

II. ch. xxviii. sect. 13, 14, 15 and 20, he would have known what I think of the eternal and unalterable nature of right and wrong, and what I call virtue and vice. And if he had observed that in the place he quotes I only report as a matter of fact what OTHERS call virtue and vice, he would not have found it liable to any great exception. For I think I am not much out in saying that one of the rules made use of in the world for a ground or measure of a moral relation is—that esteem and reputation which several sorts of actions find variously in the several societies of men, according to which they are there called virtues or vices. And whatever authority the learned Mr. Lowde places in his Old English Dictionary, I daresay it nowhere tells him (if I should appeal to it) that the same action is not in credit, called and counted a virtue, in one place, which, being in disrepute, passes for and under the name of vice in another. The taking notice that men bestow the names of ‘virtue’ and ‘vice’ according to this rule of Reputation is all I have done, or can be laid to my charge to have done, towards the making vice virtue or virtue vice. But the good man does well, and as becomes his calling, to be watchful in such points, and to take the alarm even at expressions, which, standing alone by themselves, might sound ill and be suspected.</p>

II): “Even the exhortations of inspired teachers have not feared to appeal to common repute, Philip, iv. 8;” without taking notice of those immediately preceding, which introduce them, and run thus: “Whereby even in the corruption of manners, the true boundaries of the law of nature, which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice, were pretty well preserved. So that even the exhortations of inspired teachers,” &amp;c. By which words, and the rest of that section, it is plain that I brought that passage of St. Paul, not to prove that the general measure of what men called virtue and vice throughout the world was the reputation and fashion of each particular society within itself; but to show that, though it were so, yet, for reasons I there give, men, in that way of denominating their actions, did not for the most part much stray from the Law of Nature; which is that standing and unalterable rule by which they ought to judge of the moral rectitude and gravity of their actions, and accordingly denominate them virtues or vices. Had Mr. Lowde considered this, he would have found it little to his purpose to have quoted this passage in a sense I used it not; and would I imagine have spared the application he subjoins to it, as not very necessary. But I hope this Second Edition will give him satisfaction on the point, and that this matter is now so expressed as to show him there was no cause for scruple.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Though I am forced to differ from him in these apprehensions he has expressed, in the latter end of his preface, concerning what I had said about virtue and vice, yet we are better agreed than he thinks in what he says in his third chapter (p. 78) concerning “natural inscription and innate notions.” I shall not deny him the privilege he claims (p. 52), to state the question as he pleases, especially when he states it so as to leave nothing in it contrary to what I have said. For, according to him, “innate notions, being conditional things, depending upon the concurrence of several other circumstances in order to the soul’s exerting them,” all that he says for “innate, imprinted, impressed notions” (for of innate IDEAS he says nothing at all), amounts at last only to this—that there are certain propositions which, though the soul from the beginning, or when a man is born, does not know, yet “by assistance from the outward senses, and the help of some previous cultivation,” it may AFTERWARDS come certainly to know the truth of; which is no more than what I have affirmed in my First Book. For I suppose by the “soul’s exerting them,” he means its beginning to know them; or else the soul’s ‘exerting of notions’ will be to me a very unintelligible expression; and I think at best is a very unfit one in this, it misleading men’s thoughts by an insinuation, as if these notions were in the mind before the ‘soul exerts them,’ i. e. before they are known;—whereas truly before they are known, there is nothing of them in the mind but a capacity to know them, when the ‘concurrence of those circumstances,’ which this ingenious author thinks necessary ‘in order to the soul’s exerting them,’ brings them into our knowledge.</p>

And possibly ‘tis but here and there one who gives himself the trouble to consider them so far as to know what he himself or others precisely mean by them. I have therefore in most places chose to put DETERMINATE or DETERMINED, instead of CLEAR and DISTINCT, as more likely to direct men’s thoughts to my meaning in this matter. By those denominations, I mean some object in the mind, and consequently determined, i. e. such as it is there seen and perceived to be. This, I think, may fitly be called a determinate or determined idea, when such as it is at any time objectively in the mind, and so determined there, it is annexed, and without variation determined, to a name or articulate sound, which is to be steadily the sign of that very same object of the mind, or determinate idea.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To explain this a little more particularly. By DETERMINATE, when applied to a simple idea, I mean that simple appearance which the mind has in its view, or perceives in itself, when that idea is said to be in it: by DETERMINED, when applied to a complex idea, I mean such an one as consists of a determinate number of certain simple or less complex ideas, joined in such a proportion and situation as the mind has before its view, and sees in itself, when that idea is present in it, or should be present in it, when a man gives a name to it. I say SHOULD be, because it is not every one, nor perhaps any one, who is so careful of his language as to use no word till he views in his mind the precise determined idea which he resolves to make it the sign of.

Where he does not, or cannot do this, he in vain pretends to clear or distinct ideas: it is plain his are not so; and therefore there can be expected nothing but obscurity and confusion, where such terms are made use of which have not such a precise determination.</p>

I have made choice of these terms to signify, (1) Some immediate object of the mind, which it perceives and has before it, distinct from the sound it uses as a sign of it. (2) That this idea, thus determined, i.e. which the mind has in itself, and knows, and sees there, be determined without any change to that name, and that name determined to that precise idea.

The understanding, like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive all other things, takes no notice of itself; and it requires and art and pains to set it at a distance and make it its own object. But whatever be the difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry; whatever it be that keeps us so much in the dark to ourselves; sure I am that all the light we can let in upon our minds, all the acquaintance we can make with our own understandings, will not only be very pleasant, but bring us great advantage, in directing our thoughts in the search of other things.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">既然是理解力使人凌驾于其他可感知的生命之上，并使他拥有对他们的所有优势和支配权；那么，即使是为了它的高尚，它也肯定是一个值得我们努力探究的主题。理解力，就像眼睛一样，虽然它使我们看到和感知所有其他事物，但却没有注意到它自己；它需要艺术和努力，把它放在远处，使它成为自己的目标。但是，不管在这种探究的道路上有什么困难；不管是什么让我们对自己如此蒙在鼓里；我确信，我们能让我们的思想得到的所有光亮，我们能与我们自己的理解相识，不仅会非常愉快，而且会给我们带来巨大的好处，引导我们的思想去寻找其他事物。</p>

These are speculations which, however curious and entertaining, I shall decline, as lying out of my way in the design I am now upon. It shall suffice to my present purpose, to consider the discerning faculties of a man, as they are employed about the objects which they have to do with. And I shall imagine I have not wholly misemployed myself in the thoughts I shall have on this occasion, if, in this historical, plain method, I can give any account of the ways whereby our understandings come to attain those notions of things we have; and can set down any measures of the certainty of our knowledge; or the grounds of those persuasions which are to be found amongst men, so various, different, and wholly contradictory; and yet asserted somewhere or other with such assurance and confidence, that he that shall take a view of the opinions of mankind, observe their opposition, and at the same time consider the fondness and devotion wherewith they are embraced, the resolution and eagerness wherewith they are maintained, may perhaps have reason to suspect, that either there is no such thing as truth at all, or that mankind hath no sufficient means to attain a certain knowledge of it.</p>

We should not then perhaps be so forward, out of an affectation of an universal knowledge, to raise questions, and perplex ourselves and others with disputes about things to which our understandings are not suited; and of which we cannot frame in our minds any clear or distinct perceptions, or whereof (as it has perhaps too often happened) we have not any notions at all.

Men have reason to be well satisfied with what God hath thought fit for them, since he hath given them (as St. Peter says) [words in Greek], whatsoever is necessary for the conveniences of life and information of virtue; and has put within the reach of their discovery, the comfortable provision for this life, and the way that leads to a better. How short soever their knowledge may come of an universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever is, it yet secures their great concernments, that they have light enough to lead them to the knowledge of their Maker, and the sight of their own duties. Men may find matter sufficient to busy their heads, and employ their hands with variety, delight, and satisfaction, if they will not boldly quarrel with their own constitution, and throw away the blessings their hands are filled with, because they are not big enough to grasp everything. We shall not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of our minds, if we will but employ them about what may be of use to us; for of that they are very capable. And it will be an unpardonable, as well as childish peevishness, if we undervalue the advantages of our knowledge, and neglect to improve it to the ends for which it was given us, because there are some things that are set out of the reach of it. It will be no excuse to an idle and untoward servant, who would not attend his business by candle light, to plead that he had not broad sunshine. The Candle that is set up in us shines bright enough for all our purposes. The discoveries we can make with this ought to satisfy us; and we shall then use our understandings right, when we entertain all objects in that way and proportion that they are suited to our faculties, and upon those grounds they are capable of being proposed to us; and not peremptorily or intemperately require demonstration, and demand certainty, where probability only is to be had, and which is sufficient to govern all our concernments.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">This was that which gave the first rise to this Essay concerning the understanding. For I thought that the first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of man was very apt to run into, was, to take a survey of our own understandings, examine our own powers, and see to what things they were adapted. Till that was done I suspected we began at the wrong end, and in vain sought for satisfaction in a quiet and sure possession of truths that most concerned us, whilst we let loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of Being; as if all that boundless extent were the natural and undoubted possession of our understandings, wherein there was nothing exempt from its decisions, or that escaped its comprehension. Thus men, extending their inquiries beyond their capacities, and letting their thoughts wander into those depths where they can find no sure footing, it is no wonder that they raise questions and multiply disputes, which, never coming to any clear resolution, are proper only to continue and increase their doubts, and to confirm them at last in perfect scepticism. Whereas, were the capacities of our understandings well considered, the extent of our knowledge once discovered, and the horizon found which sets the bounds between the enlightened and dark parts of things; between what is and what is not comprehensible by us, men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one, and employ their thoughts and discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这也是这篇关于理解力的文章的最初起因。因为我认为，要满足人的思想很容易陷入的几个问题，第一步就是对我们自己的理解进行调查，检查我们自己的能力，看看它们适合做什么事情。在这样做之前，我怀疑我们的出发点是错误的，我们徒劳地寻求满足于对与我们最有关的真理的安静和肯定的占有，而我们却把我们的思想放进存在的浩瀚海洋；仿佛所有那无边的范围是我们理解力的自然和毫无疑问的占有，在那里没有什么可以免于它的决定，或逃避它的理解。因此，人们把他们的探究延伸到他们的能力之外，让他们的思想徘徊在那些他们找不到可靠立足点的深处，难怪他们会提出问题和增加争论，而这些问题和争论从未得到任何明确的解决，只是为了继续和增加他们的怀疑，并最终在完美的怀疑论中证实他们。然而，如果充分考虑到我们的理解能力，一旦发现我们的知识范围，并找到确定事物的启蒙部分和黑暗部分之间的界限的地平线；在我们能理解的和不能理解的事物之间，人们也许会不那么顾忌地默认一个人的公开无知，而在另一个人身上更有利地运用他们的思想和讨论。</p>

But, before I proceed on to what I have thought on this subject, I must here in the entrance beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word IDEA, which he will find in the following treatise. It being that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the OBJECT of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by PHANTASM, NOTION, SPECIES, or WHATEVER IT IS WHICH THE MIND CAN BE EMPLOYED ABOUT IN THINKING; and I could not avoid frequently using it.

It would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the falseness of this supposition, if I should only show (as I hope I shall in the following parts of this Discourse) how men, barely by the use of their natural faculties may attain to all the knowledge they have, without the help of any innate impressions; and may arrive at certainty, without any such original notions or principles. For I imagine any one will easily grant that it would be impertinent to suppose the ideas of colours innate in a creature to whom God hath given sight, and a power to receive them by the eyes from external objects: and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths to the impressions of nature, and innate characters, when we may observe in ourselves faculties fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of them as if they were originally imprinted on the mind.</p>

These have so settled a reputation of maxims universally received, that it will no doubt be thought strange if any one should seem to question it.

And the want of that is enough to destroy that universal assent which must needs be the necessary concomitant of all innate truths: it seeming to me near a contradiction to say, that there are truths imprinted on the soul, which it perceives or understands not: imprinting, if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making certain truths to be perceived. For to imprint anything on the mind without the mind’s perceiving it, seems to me hardly intelligible. If therefore children and idiots have souls, have minds, with those impressions upon them, THEY must unavoidably perceive them, and necessarily know and assent to these truths; which since they do not, it is evident that there are no such impressions. For if they are not notions naturally imprinted, how can they be innate? and if they are notions imprinted, how can they be unknown? To say a notion is imprinted on the mind, and yet at the same time to say, that the mind is ignorant of it, and never yet took notice of it, is to make this impression nothing. No proposition can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew, which it was never yet conscious of. For if any one may, then, by the same reason, all propositions that are true, and the mind is capable ever of assenting to, may be said to be in the mind, and to be imprinted: since, if any one can be said to be in the mind, which it never yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of knowing it; and so the mind is of all truths it ever shall know. Nay, thus truths may be imprinted on the mind which it never did, nor ever shall know; for a man may live long, and die at last in ignorance of many truths which his mind was capable of knowing, and that with certainty. So that if the capacity of knowing be the natural impression contended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know will, by this account, be every one of them innate; and this great point will amount to no more, but only to a very improper way of speaking; which, whilst it pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing different from those who deny innate principles. For nobody, I think, ever denied that the mind was capable of knowing several truths. The capacity, they say, is innate; the knowledge acquired. But then to what end such contest for certain innate maxims? If truths can be imprinted on the understanding without being perceived, I can see no difference there can be between any truths the mind is CAPABLE of knowing in respect of their original: they must all be innate or all adventitious: in vain shall a man go about to distinguish them. He therefore that talks of innate notions in the understanding, cannot (if he intend thereby any distinct sort of truths) mean such truths to be in the understanding as it never perceived, and is yet wholly ignorant of. For if these words “to be in the understanding” have any propriety, they signify to be understood. So that to be in the understanding, and not to be understood; to be in the mind and never to be perceived, is all one as to say anything is and is not in the mind or understanding. If therefore these two propositions, “Whatsoever is, is,” and “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” are by nature imprinted, children cannot be ignorant of them: infants, and all that have souls, must necessarily have them in their understandings, know the truth of them, and assent to it.</p>

We may as well think the use of reason necessary to make our eyes discover visible objects, as that there should be need of reason, or the exercise thereof, to make the understanding see what is originally engraven on it, and cannot be in the understanding before it be perceived by it. So that to make reason discover those truths thus imprinted, is to say, that the use of reason discovers to a man what he knew before: and if men have those innate impressed truths originally, and before the use of reason, and yet are always ignorant of them till they come to the use of reason, it is in effect to say, that men know and know them not at the same time.</p>

First, it is false; because it is evident these maxims are not in the mind so early as the use of reason; and therefore the coming to the use of reason is falsely assigned as the time of their discovery. How many instances of the use of reason may we observe in children, a long time before they have any knowledge of this maxim, “That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be?” And a great part of illiterate people and savages pass many years, even of their rational age, without ever thinking on this and the like general propositions. I grant, men come not to the knowledge of these general and more abstract truths, which are thought innate, till they come to the use of reason; and I add, nor then neither. Which is so, because, till after they come to the use of reason, those general abstract ideas are not framed in the mind, about which those general maxims are, which are mistaken for innate principles, but are indeed discoveries made and verities introduced and brought into the mind by the same way, and discovered by the same steps, as several other propositions, which nobody was ever so extravagant as to suppose innate.

		<p class="calibre5 en">But, secondly, were it true that the precise time of their being known and assented to were, when men come to the use of reason; neither would that prove them innate. This way of arguing is as frivolous as the supposition itself is false. For, by what kind of logic will it appear that any notion is originally by nature imprinted in the mind in its first constitution, because it comes first to be observed and assented to when a faculty of the mind, which has quite a distinct province, begins to exert itself? And therefore the coming to the use of speech, if it were supposed the time that these maxims are first assented to, (which it may be with as much truth as the time when men come to the use of reason,) would be as good a proof that they were innate, as to say they are innate because men assent to them when they come to the use of reason. I agree then with these men of innate principles, that there is no knowledge of these general and self-evident maxims in the mind, till it comes to the exercise of reason: but I deny that the coming to the use of reason is the precise time when they are first taken notice of; and if that were the precise time, I deny that it would prove them innate. All that can with any truth be meant by this proposition, that men ‘assent to them when they come to the use of reason,’ is no more but this,—that the making of general abstract ideas, and the understanding of general names, being a concomitant of the rational faculty, and growing up with it, children commonly get not those general ideas, nor learn the names that stand for them, till, having for a good while exercised their reason about familiar and more particular ideas, they are, by their ordinary discourse and actions with others, acknowledged to be capable of rational conversation. If assenting to these maxims, when men come to the use of reason, can be true in any other sense, I desire it may be shown; or at least, how in this, or any other sense, it proves them innate.</p>

Afterwards, the mind proceeding further, abstracts them, and by degrees learns the use of general names. In this manner the mind comes to be furnished with ideas and language, the MATERIALS about which to exercise its discursive faculty. And the use of reason becomes daily more visible, as these materials that give it employment increase. But though the having of general ideas and the use of general words and reason usually grow together, yet I see not how this any way proves them innate. The knowledge of some truths, I confess, is very early in the mind; but in a way that shows them not to be innate. For, if we will observe, we shall find it still to be about ideas, not innate, but acquired; it being about those first which are imprinted by external things, with which infants have earliest to do, which make the most frequent impressions on their senses. In ideas thus got, the mind discovers that some agree and others differ, probably as soon as it has any use of memory; as soon as it is able to retain and perceive distinct ideas. But whether it be then or no, this is certain, it does so long before it has the use of words; or comes to that which we commonly call “the use of reason.” For a child knows as certainly before it can speak the difference between the ideas of sweet and bitter (i.e. that sweet is not bitter), as it knows afterwards (when it comes to speak) that wormwood and sugarplums are not the same thing.</p>

But neither does he then readily assent because it is an innate truth, nor was his assent wanting till then because he wanted the use of reason; but the truth of it appears to him as soon as he has settled in his mind the clear and distinct ideas that these names stand for. And then he knows the truth of that proposition upon the same ground and by the same means, that he knew before that a rod and a cherry are not the same thing; and upon the same ground also that he may come to know afterwards “That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” as shall be more fully shown hereafter. So that the later it is before any one comes to have those general ideas about which those maxims are; or to know the signification of those generic terms that stand for them; or to put together in his mind the ideas they stand for; the later also will it be before he comes to assent to those maxims;—whose terms, with the ideas they stand for, being no more innate than those of a cat or a weasel he must stay till time and observation have acquainted him with them; and then he will be in a capacity to know the truth of these maxims, upon the first occasion that shall make him put together those ideas in his mind, and observe whether they agree or disagree, according as is expressed in those propositions. And therefore it is that a man knows that eighteen and nineteen are equal to thirty-seven, by the same self-evidence that he knows one and two to be equal to three: yet a child knows this not so soon as the other; not for want of the use of reason, but because the ideas the words eighteen nineteen, and thirty-seven stand for, are not so soon got, as those which are signified by one, two, and three.</p>

For, since men never fail after they have once understood the words, to acknowledge them for undoubted truths, they would infer, that certainly these propositions were first lodged in the understanding, which, without any teaching, the mind, at the very first proposal immediately closes with and assents to, and after that never doubts again.</p>

If it be not, such a general assent is in vain urged as a proof of them: if it be said that it is a mark of innate, they must then allow all such propositions to be innate which are generally assented to as soon as heard, whereby they will find themselves plentifully stored with innate principles. For upon the same ground, viz. of assent at first hearing and understanding the terms, that men would have those maxims pass for innate, they must also admit several propositions about numbers to be innate; and thus, that one and two are equal to three, that two and two are equal to four, and a multitude of other the like propositions in numbers, that everybody assents to at first hearing and understanding the terms, must have a place amongst these innate axioms. Nor is this the prerogative of numbers alone, and propositions made about several of them; but even natural philosophy, and all the other sciences, afford propositions which are sure to meet with assent as soon as they are understood. That “two bodies cannot be in the same place” is a truth that nobody any more sticks at than at these maxims, that “it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” that “white is not black,” that “a square is not a circle,” that “bitterness is not sweetness.” These and a million of such other propositions, as many at least as we have distinct, ideas of, every man in his wits, at first hearing, and knowing, what the names stand for, must necessarily assent to. If these men will be true to their own rule, and have assent at first hearing and understanding the terms to be a mark of innate, they must allow not only as many innate proposition as men have distinct ideas, but as many as men can make propositions wherein different ideas are denied one of another. Since every proposition wherein one different idea is denied of another, will as certainly find assent at first hearing and understanding the terms as this general one, “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” or that which is the foundation of it and is the easier understood of the two, “The same is not different”; by which account they will have legions of innate propositions of this one sort, without mentioning any other. But, since no proposition can be innate unless the <i class="calibre9">ideas</i> about which it is be innate, this will be to suppose all our ideas of colours, sounds, tastes, figure, &amp;c., innate, than which there cannot be anything more opposite to reason and experience. Universal and ready assent upon hearing and understanding the terms is, I grant, a mark of self-evidence; but self-evidence, depending not on innate impressions, but on something else, (as we shall show hereafter,) belongs to several propositions which nobody was yet so extravagant as to pretend to be innate.</p>

For, if they were innate, what need they be proposed in order to gaining assent, when, by being in the understanding, by a natural and original impression, (if there were any such,) they could not but be known before? Or doth the proposing them print them clearer in the mind than nature did? If so, then the consequence will be, that a man knows them better after he has been thus taught them than he did before. Whence it will follow that these principles may be made more evident to us by others’ teaching than nature has made them by impression: which will ill agree with the opinion of innate principles, and give but little authority to them; but, on the contrary, makes them unfit to be the foundations of all our other knowledge; as they are pretended to be. This cannot be denied, that men grow first acquainted with many of these self-evident truths upon their being proposed: but it is clear that whosoever does so, finds in himself that he then begins to know a proposition, which he knew not before, and which from thenceforth he never questions; not because it was innate, but because the consideration of the nature of the things contained in those words would not suffer him to think otherwise, how, or whensoever he is brought to reflect on them. And if whatever is assented to at first hearing and understanding the terms must pass for an innate principle, every well-grounded observation, drawn from particulars into a general rule, must be innate. When yet it is certain that not all, but only sagacious heads, light at first on these observations, and reduce them into general propositions: not innate but collected from a preceding acquaintance and reflection on particular instances.

		<p class="calibre5 en">There is, I fear, this further weakness in the foregoing argument, which would persuade us that therefore those maxims are to be thought innate, which men admit at first hearing; because they assent to propositions which they are not taught, nor do receive from the force of any argument or demonstration, but a bare explication or understanding of the terms. Under which there seems to me to lie this fallacy, that men are supposed not to be taught nor to learn anything DE NOVO; when, in truth, they are taught, and do learn something they were ignorant of before. For, first, it is evident that they have learned the terms, and their signification; neither of which was born with them. But this is not all the acquired knowledge in the case: the ideas themselves, about which the proposition is, are not born with them, no more than their names, but got afterwards. So that in all propositions that are assented to at first hearing, the terms of the proposition, their standing for such ideas, and the ideas themselves that they stand for, being neither of them innate, I would fain know what there is remaining in such propositions that is innate. For I would gladly have any one name that proposition whose terms or ideas were either of them innate. We BY DEGREES get ideas and names, and LEARN their appropriated connexion one with another; and then to propositions made in such, terms, whose signification we have learnt, and wherein the agreement or disagreement we can perceive in our ideas when put together is expressed, we at first hearing assent; though to other propositions, in themselves as certain and evident, but which are concerning ideas not so soon or so easily got, we are at the same time no way capable of assenting. For, though a child quickly assents to this proposition, “That an apple is not fire,” when by familiar acquaintance he has got the ideas of those two different things distinctly imprinted on his mind, and has learnt that the names apple and fire stand for them; yet it will be some years after, perhaps, before the same child will assent to this proposition, “That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be”; because that, though perhaps the words are as easy to be learnt, yet the signification of them being more large, comprehensive, and abstract than of the names annexed to those sensible things the child hath to do with, it is longer before he learns their precise meaning, and it requires more time plainly to form in his mind those general ideas they stand for. Till that be done, you will in vain endeavour to make any child assent to a proposition made up of such general terms; but as soon as ever he has got those ideas, and learned their names, he forwardly closes with the one as well as the other of the forementioned propositions: and with both for the same reason; viz. because he finds the ideas he has in his mind to agree or disagree, according as the words standing for them are affirmed or denied one of another in the proposition. But if propositions be brought to him in words which stand for ideas he has not yet in his mind, to such propositions, however evidently true or false in themselves, he affords neither assent nor dissent, but is ignorant. For words being but empty sounds, any further than they are signs of our ideas, we cannot but assent to them as they correspond to those ideas we have, but no further than that. But the showing by what steps and ways knowledge comes into our minds; and the grounds of several degrees of assent, being; the business of the following Discourse, it may suffice to have only touched on it here, as one reason that made me doubt of those innate principles.</p>

Whether we can determine it or no, it matters not, there is certainly a time when children begin to think, and their words and actions do assure us that they do so. When therefore they are capable of thought, of knowledge, of assent, can it rationally be supposed they can be ignorant of those notions that nature has imprinted, were there any such? Can it be imagined, with any appearance of reason, that they perceive the impressions from things without, and be at the same time ignorant of those characters which nature itself has taken care to stamp within? Can they receive and assent to adventitious notions, and be ignorant of those which are supposed woven into the very principles of their being, and imprinted there in indelible characters, to be the foundation and guide of all their acquired knowledge and future reasonings? This would be to make nature take pains to no purpose; or at least to write very ill; since its characters could not be read by those eyes which saw other things very well: and those are very ill supposed the clearest parts of truth, and the foundations of all our knowledge, which are not first known, and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other things may be had. The child certainly knows, that the nurse that feeds it is neither the cat it plays with, nor the blackmoor it is afraid of: that the wormseed or mustard it refuses, is not the apple or sugar it cries for: this it is certainly and undoubtedly assured of: but will any one say, it is by virtue of this principle, “That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be,” that it so firmly assents to these and other parts of its knowledge? Or that the child has any notion or apprehension of that proposition at an age, wherein yet, it is plain, it knows a great many other truths? He that will say, children join in these general abstract speculations with their sucking-bottles and their rattles, may perhaps, with justice, be thought to have more passion and zeal for his opinion, but less sincerity and truth, than one of that age.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">That the general maxims we are discoursing of are not known to children, idiots, and a great part of mankind, we have already sufficiently proved: whereby it is evident they have not an universal assent, nor are general impressions. But there is this further argument in it against their being innate: that these characters, if they were native and original impressions, should appear fairest and clearest in those persons in whom yet we find no footsteps of them; and it is, in my opinion, a strong presumption that they are not innate, since they are least known to those in whom, if they were innate, they must needs exert themselves with most force and vigour. For children, idiots, savages, and illiterate people, being of all others the least corrupted by custom, or borrowed opinions; learning and education having not cast their native thoughts into new moulds; nor by superinducing foreign and studied doctrines, confounded those fair characters nature had written there; one might reasonably imagine that in THEIR minds these innate notions should lie open fairly to every one’s view, as it is certain the thoughts of children do. It might very well be expected that these principles should be perfectly known to naturals; which being stamped immediately on the soul, (as these men suppose,) can have no dependence on the constitution or organs of the body, the only confessed difference between them and others. One would think, according to these men’s principles, that all these native beams of light (were there any such) should, in those who have no reserves, no arts of concealment, shine out in their full lustre, and leave us in no more doubt of their being there, than we are of their love of pleasure and abhorrence of pain. But alas, amongst children, idiots, savages, and the grossly illiterate, what general maxims are to be found? what universal principles of knowledge? Their notions are few and narrow, borrowed only from those objects they have had most to do with, and which have made upon their senses the frequentest and strongest impressions. A child knows his nurse and his cradle, and by degrees the playthings of a little more advanced age; and a young savage has, perhaps, his head filled with love and hunting, according to the fashion of his tribe. But he that from a child untaught, or a wild inhabitant of the woods, will expect these abstract maxims and reputed principles of science, will, I fear find himself mistaken. Such kind of general propositions are seldom mentioned in the huts of Indians: much less are they to be found in the thoughts of children, or any impressions of them on the minds of naturals. They are the language and business of the schools and academies of learned nations accustomed to that sort of conversation or learning, where disputes are frequent; these maxims being suited to artificial argumentation and useful for conviction, but not much conducing to the discovery of truth or advancement of knowledge. But of their small use for the improvement of knowledge I shall have occasion to speak more at large, l.4, c. 7.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">If those speculative Maxims, whereof we discoursed in the foregoing chapter, have not an actual universal assent from all mankind, as we there proved, it is much more visible concerning PRACTICAL Principles, that they come short of an universal reception: and I think it will be hard to instance any one moral rule which can pretend to so general and ready an assent as, “What is, is”; or to be so manifest a truth as this, that “It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” Whereby it is evident that they are further removed from a title to be innate; and the doubt of their being native impressions on the mind is stronger against those moral principles than the other. Not that it brings their truth at all in question. They are equally true, though not equally evident. Those speculative maxims carry their own evidence with them: but moral principles require reasoning and discourse, and some exercise of the mind, to discover the certainty of their truth. They lie not open as natural characters engraved on the mind; which, if any such were, they must needs be visible by themselves, and by their own light be certain and known to everybody. But this is no derogation to their truth and certainty; no more than it is to the truth or certainty of the three angles of a triangle being equal to two right ones because it is not so evident as “the whole is bigger than a part,” nor so apt to be assented to at first hearing. It may suffice that these moral rules are capable of demonstration: and therefore it is our own faults if we come not to a certain knowledge of them. But the ignorance wherein many men are of them, and the slowness of assent wherewith others receive them, are manifest proofs that they are not innate, and such as offer themselves to their view without searching.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果我们在前一章中讨论的那些推测性格言没有得到全人类的实际普遍赞同，正如我们在那里所证明的那样，那么关于实践性原则，就更明显了，它们没有得到普遍接受：我想很难举出任何一条道德规则，可以假装得到 "是什么，就是什么 "这样普遍和随时的赞同；或者是这样一个明显的真理，即 "同一事物不可能既是又不是。"由此可见，它们与先天的称号相去甚远；对它们是心灵上的本源印象的怀疑，比其他道德原则更强烈。这并不是说它使它们的真理受到了质疑。它们同样是真实的，尽管不是同样明显的。那些推测性的格言带有它们自己的证据：但道德原则需要推理和讨论，以及一些思维的锻炼，以发现它们真理的确定性。它们并不像刻在心灵上的自然特性那样开放；如果有这样的特性，它们本身就必须是可见的，而且通过它们自己的光亮是确定的，是人人都知道的。但这并不妨碍它们的真实性和确定性；就像三角形的三个角等于两个直角的真实性和确定性一样，因为它不像 "整体大于部分 "那样明显，也不像一听就能接受。这些道德规则是可以证明的，这就足够了：因此，如果我们不对它们有一定的了解，那就是我们自己的错了。但是，许多人对它们一无所知，其他人对它们的认同也很迟钝，这都清楚地证明了它们不是与生俱来的，而是不经搜索就能看到的。</p>

Where is that practical truth that is universally received, without doubt or question, as it must be if innate? JUSTICE, and keeping of contracts, is that which most men seem to agree in. This is a principle which is thought to extend itself to the dens of thieves, and the confederacies of the greatest villains; and they who have gone furthest towards the putting off of humanity itself, keep faith and rules of justice one with another. I grant that outlaws themselves do this one amongst another: but it is without receiving these as the innate laws of nature. They practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities: but it is impossible to conceive that he embraces justice as a practical principle who acts fairly with his fellow-highwayman, and at the same time plunders or kills the next honest man he meets with. Justice and truth are the common ties of society; and therefore even outlaws and robbers, who break with all the world besides, must keep faith and rules of equity amongst themselves; or else they cannot hold together.

		<p class="calibre5 en">Perhaps it will be urged, that the tacit assent of their minds agrees to what their practice contradicts. I answer, first, I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. But, since it is certain that most men’s practices, and some men’s open professions, have either questioned or denied these principles, it is impossible to establish an universal consent, (though we should look for it only amongst grown men,) without which it is impossible to conclude them innate. Secondly, it is very strange and unreasonable to suppose innate practical principles, that terminate only in contemplation. Practical principles, derived from nature, are there for operation, and must produce conformity of action, not barely speculative assent to their truth, or else they are in vain distinguished from speculative maxims. Nature, I confess, has put into man a desire of happiness and an aversion to misery: these indeed are innate practical principles which (as practical principles ought) DO continue constantly to operate and influence all our actions without ceasing: these may be observed in all persons and all ages, steady and universal; but these are INCLINATIONS OF THE APPETITE to good, not impressions of truth on the understanding. I deny not that there are natural tendencies imprinted on the minds of men; and that from the very first instances of sense and perception, there are some things that are grateful and others unwelcome to them; some things that they incline to and others that they fly: but this makes nothing for innate characters on the mind, which are to be the principles of knowledge regulating our practice. Such natural impressions on the understanding are so far from being confirmed hereby, that this is an argument against them; since, if there were certain characters imprinted by nature on the understanding, as the principles of knowledge, we could not but perceive them constantly operate in us and influence our knowledge, as we do those others on the will and appetite; which never cease to be the constant springs and motives of all our actions, to which we perpetually feel them strongly impelling us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">也许有人会说，他们头脑中的默许同意了他们的做法，而他们的做法却与之相矛盾。我回答说，首先，我一直认为人的行为是他们思想的最好解释者。但是，既然可以肯定的是，大多数人的做法，以及一些人公开的职业，不是质疑就是否认这些原则，那么就不可能建立一种普遍的同意，（尽管我们只应该在成年男子中寻找这种同意），没有这种同意就不可能得出这些原则是与生俱来的。其次，假设先天的实践原则仅止于思考，这是非常奇怪和不合理的。源自自然的实践原则是为了操作，必须产生一致的行动，而不是勉强对其真理的推测性认同，否则它们与推测性格言的区别是徒劳的。我承认，大自然给人带来了对幸福的渴望和对痛苦的厌恶：这些确实是与生俱来的实用原则，它们（作为实用原则应该）持续不断地发挥作用，不停地影响我们的所有行为：这些可以在所有人和所有时代中观察到，稳定而普遍；但这些是对善的渴望的包含，而不是对真理的理解的印象。我不否认有一些自然的倾向印在人的头脑中；从最初的感觉和知觉开始，就有一些东西对他们来说是感激的，而另一些则是不受欢迎的；有些东西是他们所倾向的，而另一些则是他们所逃避的：但这并不能说明头脑中的先天特征，这些特征将成为规范我们行为的知识原则。在理解力上的这种自然印象远没有在此得到证实，这是一个反对它们的论据；因为，如果有某些由自然界印在理解力上的特征，作为知识的原则，我们就不能不察觉它们不断地在我们身上运作并影响我们的知识，就像我们对意志和食欲的其他印象一样；它们永远是我们所有行为的恒定泉源和动机，我们永远感到它们在强烈推动我们。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Another reason that makes me doubt of any innate practical principles is, that I think THERE CANNOT ANY ONE MORAL RULE BE PROPOSED WHEREOF A MAN MAY NOT JUSTLY DEMAND A REASON: which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd if they were innate; or so much as self-evident, which every innate principle must needs be, and not need any proof to ascertain its truth, nor want any reason to gain it approbation. He would be thought void of common sense who asked on the one side, or on the other side went to give a reason WHY “it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.” It carries its own light and evidence with it, and needs no other proof: he that understands the terms assents to it for its own sake or else nothing will ever be able to prevail with him to do it. But should that most unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue, “That should do as he would be done unto,” be proposed to one who never heard of it before, but yet is of capacity to understand its meaning; might he not without any absurdity ask a reason why? And were not he that proposed it bound to make out the truth and reasonableness of it to him? Which plainly shows it not to be innate; for if it were it could neither want nor receive any proof; but must needs (at least as soon as heard and understood) be received and assented to as an unquestionable truth, which a man can by no means doubt of. So that the truth of all these moral rules plainly depends upon some other antecedent to them, and from which they must be DEDUCED; which could not be if either they were innate or so much as self-evident.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">另一个让我对任何先天的实践原则产生怀疑的原因是，我认为不可能提出任何一条道德规则，而人们可能不会理直气壮地要求提供理由：如果它们是先天的，那将是完全可笑和荒谬的；或者说是不言而喻的，每一个先天的原则都必须是这样的，不需要任何证据来确定其真理，也不需要任何理由来获得其认可。他将被认为是没有常识的，因为他一方面要求，另一方面又要给出一个理由，为什么 "同一事物不可能存在和不存在"。它带有自己的光芒和证据，不需要其他证明：理解这些条款的人为了它自己而同意它，否则没有什么能说服他去做。但是，如果向一个从未听说过但有能力理解其含义的人提出 "己所不欲，勿施于人 "这条最不可动摇的道德规则和所有社会美德的基础；他难道不会问一个理由吗？而提出这个建议的人难道没有义务向他说明这个建议的真实性和合理性吗？这清楚地表明它不是与生俱来的；因为如果它是与生俱来的，它既不需要也不接受任何证明；而是必须（至少在听到和理解之后）被接受和赞同为一个不容置疑的真理，一个人决不能怀疑。因此，所有这些道德规则的真实性显然取决于它们的其他前因，而且它们必须从这些前因中获得；如果它们是天生的或不言自明的，就不可能是这样。</p>

But yet, if a Christian, who has the view of happiness and misery in another life, be asked why a man must keep his word, he will give this as a reason:—Because God, who has the power of eternal life and death, requires it of us. But if a Hobbist be asked why? he will answer:—Because the public requires it, and the Leviathan will punish you if you do not.

		<p class="calibre5 cn">人应该遵守自己的契约，这当然是一条伟大而不可否认的道德规则。但是，如果有人问一个基督徒，为什么一个人必须遵守他的诺言，他将给出这样的理由：因为拥有永生和死亡权力的上帝要求我们这样做。但如果有人问一个霍比特人为什么，他会回答："因为公众需要它，如果你不这样做，利维坦会惩罚你。如果有人问一位老哲学家，他会回答："因为不这样做是不诚实的，是低于人的尊严的，是与美德相反的，是人性的最高完善。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Hence naturally flows the great variety of opinions concerning moral rules which are to be found among men, according to the different sorts of happiness they have a prospect of, or propose to themselves; which could not be if practical principles were innate, and imprinted in our minds immediately by the hand of God. I grant the existence of God is so many ways manifest, and the obedience we owe him so congruous to the light of reason, that a great part of mankind give testimony to the law of nature: but yet I think it must be allowed that several moral rules may receive from mankind a very general approbation, without either knowing or admitting the true ground of morality; which can only be the will and law of a God, who sees men in the dark, has in his hand rewards and punishments, and power enough to call to account the proudest offender. For, God having, by an inseparable connexion, joined virtue and public happiness together, and made the practice thereof necessary to the preservation of society, and visibly beneficial to all with whom the virtuous man has to do; it is no wonder that every one should not only allow, but recommend and magnify those rules to others, from whose observance of them he is sure to reap advantage to himself. He may, out of interest as well as conviction, cry up that for sacred, which, if once trampled on and profaned, he himself cannot be safe nor secure. This, though it takes nothing from the moral and eternal obligation which these rules evidently have, yet it shows that the outward acknowledgment men pay to them in their words proves not that they are innate principles: nay, it proves not so much as that men assent to them inwardly in their own minds, as the inviolable rules of their own practice; since we find that self-interest, and the conveniences of this life, make many men own an outward profession and approbation of them, whose actions sufficiently prove that they very little consider the Lawgiver that prescribed these rules; nor the hell that he has ordained for the punishment of those that transgress them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，根据人们对幸福的不同期待或对自己的建议，自然会出现关于道德规则的各种意见；如果实用原则是与生俱来的，并由上帝之手立即印在我们的头脑中，就不可能出现这种情况。我承认，上帝的存在在很多方面都是显而易见的，我们对他的服从也是与理性的光辉相一致的，以至于大部分人都为自然法则作证：但我认为，必须允许一些道德规则得到人类的普遍认可，而不知道或不承认道德的真正基础；这只能是上帝的意志和法律，他在黑暗中看到人，手中有奖赏和惩罚，并有足够的力量叫最骄傲的犯罪者承担责任。因为，上帝通过一种不可分割的联系，把美德和公众的幸福联系在一起，并使其实践成为维护社会的必要条件，而且明显有利于所有与有德行的人打交道的人；难怪每个人不仅允许，而且向他人推荐和赞扬这些规则，因为他从这些规则的遵守中肯定会获得自己的利益。他可以出于兴趣和信念，喊出那些神圣的东西，如果这些东西一旦被践踏和亵渎，他自己就不会有安全保障。虽然这并不影响这些规则显然具有的道德和永恒的义务，但它表明，人们在言语中对它们的外在认可并不证明它们是天生的原则。因为我们发现，自我利益和今生的便利，使许多人在外表上对这些规则表示认可，而他们的行为足以证明，他们很少考虑规定这些规则的立法者；也很少考虑他为惩罚那些违反规则的人而规定的地狱。</p>

The great principle of morality, ‘To do as one would be done to,’ is more commended than practised. But the breach of this rule cannot be a greater vice, than to teach others, that it is no moral rule, nor obligatory, would be thought madness, and contrary to that interest men sacrifice to, when they break it themselves. Perhaps CONSCIENCE will be urged as checking us for such breaches, and so the internal obligation and establishment of the rule be preserved.</p>

View but an army at the sacking of a town, and see what observation or sense of moral principles, or what touch of conscience for all the outrages they do. Robberies, murders, rapes, are the sports of men set at liberty from punishment and censure. Have there not been whole nations, and those of the most civilized people, amongst whom the exposing their children, and leaving them in the fields to perish by want or wild beasts has been the practice; as little condemned or scrupled as the begetting them? Do they not still, in some countries, put them into the same graves with their mothers, if they die in childbirth; or despatch them, if a pretended astrologer declares them to have unhappy stars? And are there not places where, at a certain age, they kill or expose their parents, without any remorse at all? In a part of Asia, the sick, when their case comes to be thought desperate, are carried out and laid on the earth before they are dead; and left there, exposed to wind and weather, to perish without assistance or pity. It is familiar among the Mingrelians, a people professing Christianity, to bury their children alive without scruple. There are places where they eat their own children. The Caribbees were wont to geld their children, on purpose to fat and eat them. And Garcilasso de la Vega tells us of a people in Peru which were wont to fat and eat the children they got on their female captives, whom they kept as concubines for that purpose, and when they were past breeding, the mothers themselves were killed too and eaten. The virtues whereby the Tououpinambos believed they merited paradise, were revenge, and eating abundance of their enemies. They have not so much as a name for God, and have no religion, no worship. The saints who are canonized amongst the Turks, lead lives which one cannot with modesty relate.

I grant the objection good where men, though they transgress, yet disown not the law; where fear of shame, censure, or punishment, carries the mark of some awe it has upon them. But it is impossible to conceive that a whole nation of men should all publicly reject and renounce what every one of them certainly and infallibly knew to be a law; for so they must who have it naturally imprinted on their minds. It is possible men may sometimes own rules of morality which in their private thoughts they do not believe to be true, only to keep themselves in reputation and esteem amongst those who are persuaded of their obligation. But it is not to be imagined that a whole society of men should publicly and professedly disown and cast off a rule which they could not in their own minds but be infallibly certain was a law; nor be ignorant that all men they should have to do with knew it to be such: and therefore must every one of them apprehend from others all the contempt and abhorrence due to one who professes himself void of humanity: and one who, confounding the known and natural measures of right and wrong, cannot but be looked on as the professed enemy of their peace and happiness. Whatever practical principle is innate, cannot but be known to every one to be just and good. It is therefore little less than a contradiction to suppose, that whole nations of men should, both in their professions and practice, unanimously and universally give the lie to what, by the most invincible evidence, every one of them knew to be true, right, and good. This is enough to satisfy us that no practical rule which is anywhere universally, and with public approbation or allowance, transgressed, can be supposed innate.—But I have something further to add in answer to this objection.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这里，也许有人会反对，说规则不为人所知，因为它被破坏了，这不是一个论据。我同意这种反对意见，因为人们虽然违反了法律，但却不承认法律；因为害怕羞耻、责备或惩罚，所以对法律有某种敬畏。但是，不可能想象整个国家的人都公开拒绝和放弃他们每个人都肯定和无误地知道是法律的东西；因为他们必须这样做，因为它自然地印在他们的头脑中。人们有时可能会拥有一些在他们私下里并不认为是真实的道德规则，只是为了让自己在那些被认为有义务的人中保持声誉和尊重。但是，我们不能想象，整个社会的人都会公开地、自称是不承认和抛弃一条他们自己心里肯定是法律的规则；也不能不知道，所有与他们打交道的人都知道这是一条法律。因此，他们中的每一个人都必须从其他人那里得到对一个自称没有人性的人应有的蔑视和憎恶：一个混淆了已知的和自然的是非标准的人，不能不被看作是他们的和平和幸福的自称的敌人。无论什么实用的原则是与生俱来的，每个人都不能不知道它是公正和善良的。因此，假设整个国家的人在他们的职业和实践中都一致地、普遍地对他们每个人都知道是真实的、正确的和好的东西撒谎，这不啻是一种矛盾。这足以让我们相信，任何在任何地方被普遍地、被公众认可或允许地违反的实践规则都不能被认为是天生的。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The breaking of a rule, say you, is no argument that it is unknown. I grant it: but the GENERALLY ALLOWED breach of it anywhere, I say, is a proof that it is not innate. For example: let us take any of these rules, which, being the most obvious deductions of human reason, and conformable to the natural inclination of the greatest part of men, fewest people have had the impudence to deny or inconsideration to doubt of. If any can be thought to be naturally imprinted, none, I think, can have a fairer pretence to be innate than this: “Parents, preserve and cherish your children.” When, therefore, you say that this is an innate rule, what do you mean? Either that it is an innate principle which upon all occasions excites and directs the actions of all men; or else, that it is a truth which all men have imprinted on their minds, and which therefore they know and assent to. But in neither of these senses is it innate. FIRST, that it is not a principle which influences all men’s actions, is what I have proved by the examples before cited: nor need we seek so far as the Mingrelia or Peru to find instances of such as neglect, abuse, nay, and destroy their children; or look on it only as the more than brutality of some savage and barbarous nations, when we remember that it was a familiar and uncondemned practice amongst the Greeks and Romans to expose, without pity or remorse, their innocent infants. SECONDLY, that it is an innate truth, known to all men, is also false. For, “Parents preserve your children,” is so far from an innate truth, that it is no truth at all: it being a command, and not a proposition, and so not capable of truth or falsehood. To make it capable of being assented to as true, it must be reduced to some such proposition as this: “It is the duty of parents to preserve their children.” But what duty is, cannot be understood without a law; nor a law be known or supposed without a lawmaker, or without reward and punishment; so that it is impossible that this, or any other, practical principle should be innate, i.e. be imprinted on the mind as a duty, without supposing the ideas of God, of law, of obligation, of punishment, of a life after this, innate: for that punishment follows not in this life the breach of this rule, and consequently that it has not the force of a law in countries where the generally allowed practice runs counter to it, is in itself evident. But these ideas (which must be all of them innate, if anything as a duty be so) are so far from being innate, that it is not every studious or thinking man, much less every one that is born, in whom they are to be found clear and distinct; and that one of them, which of all others seems most likely to be innate, is not so, (I mean the idea of God,) I think, in the next chapter, will appear very evident to any considering man.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">你说，违反规则并不能证明它是未知的。我同意这一点：但我说，普遍允许在任何地方违反它，就证明它不是天生的。例如：让我们来看看这些规则中的任何一条，它们是人类理性最明显的推论，也符合大部分人的自然倾向，很少有人厚颜无耻地否认或不顾一切地怀疑。如果说有什么可以被认为是自然形成的，我想没有什么能比这更公平地假装是天生的。"父母，请保护和珍惜你的孩子"。因此，当你说这是一个天生的规则时，你是什么意思？要么是指它是一个天生的原则，在任何情况下都能激发和指导所有人的行动；要么是指它是一个所有人都印在脑海中的真理，因此他们知道并赞同。但在这两种意义上，它都不是天生的。首先，它不是影响所有人行为的原则，这一点我已经通过前面所举的例子证明了：我们也不需要到明格利亚或秘鲁去寻找那些忽视、虐待、毁灭他们孩子的例子；或者只把它看作是某些野蛮人和野蛮民族的残暴行为，因为我们记得在希腊人和罗马人中，暴露他们无辜的婴儿是一种熟悉而不被谴责的做法。其次，说这是一个与生俱来的真理，人人皆知，也是错误的。因为，"父母要保护你们的孩子"，与先天的真理相去甚远，它根本就不是真理：它是一个命令，而不是一个命题，所以不可能有真理或谬误。为了使它能够被认同为真理，它必须被简化为这样的命题。"父母有责任保护他们的孩子"。但是，如果没有法律，就无法理解什么是责任；如果没有立法者，或者没有奖惩，就无法知道或推测出法律；因此，这个或任何其他的实际原则不可能是与生俱来的，也就是说，不可能在头脑中留下印记。因此，如果不假定上帝、法律、义务、惩罚和此后的生活等观念是与生俱来的，那么这条原则或任何其他实际原则就不可能是与生俱来的，也就是说，在普遍允许的做法与它背道而驰的国家里，它不具有法律的效力，这一点本身就很明显。但是，这些观念（如果作为一种义务，它们都必须是与生俱来的）远远不是与生俱来的，以至于不是每一个善于学习或思考的人，更不是每一个出生的人，都能在他们身上找到清晰和明确的观念；其中一个观念，在所有其他观念中似乎最有可能是与生俱来的，但却不是如此，（我是指上帝的观念），我想，在下一章，对任何有思想的人来说都会显得非常明显。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">From what has been said, I think we may safely conclude that whatever practical rule is in any place generally and with allowance broken, cannot be supposed innate; it being impossible that men should, without shame or fear, confidently and serenely, break a rule which they could not but evidently know that God had set up, and would certainly punish the breach of, (which they must, if it were innate,) to a degree to make it a very ill bargain to the transgressor. Without such a knowledge as this, a man can never be certain that anything is his duty. Ignorance or doubt of the law, hopes to escape the knowledge or power of the law-maker, or the like, may make men give way to a present appetite; but let any one see the fault, and the rod by it, and with the transgression, a fire ready to punish it; a pleasure tempting, and the hand of the Almighty visibly held up and prepared to take vengeance, (for this must be the case where any duty is imprinted on the mind,) and then tell me whether it be possible for people with such a prospect, such a certain knowledge as this, wantonly, and without scruple, to offend against a law which they carry about them in indelible characters, and that stares them in the face whilst they are breaking it? Whether men, at the same time that they feel in themselves the imprinted edicts of an Omnipotent Law-maker, can, with assurance and gaiety, slight and trample underfoot his most sacred injunctions? And lastly, whether it be possible that whilst a man thus openly bids defiance to this innate law and supreme Lawgiver, all the bystanders, yea, even the governors and rulers of the people, full of the same sense both of the law and Law-maker, should silently connive, without testifying their dislike or laying the least blame on it? Principles of actions indeed there are lodged in men’s appetites; but these are so far from being innate moral principles, that if they were left to their full swing they would carry men to the overturning of all morality. Moral laws are set as a curb and restraint to these exorbitant desires, which they cannot be but by rewards and punishments that will overbalance the satisfaction any one shall propose to himself in the breach of the law. If, therefore, anything be imprinted on the minds of all men as a law, all men must have a certain and unavoidable knowledge that certain and unavoidable punishment will attend the breach of it. For if men can be ignorant or doubtful of what is innate, innate principles are insisted on, and urged to no purpose; truth and certainty (the things pretended) are not at all secured by them; but men are in the same uncertain floating estate with as without them. An evident indubitable knowledge of unavoidable punishment, great enough to make the transgression very uneligible, must accompany an innate law; unless with an innate law they can suppose an innate Gospel too. I would not here be mistaken, as if, because I deny an innate law I thought there were none but positive laws. There is a great deal of difference between an innate law, and a law of nature between something imprinted on our minds in their very original, and something that we, being ignorant of, may attain to the knowledge of, by the use and due application of our natural faculties. And I think they equally forsake the truth who, running into contrary extremes, either affirm an innate law, or deny that there is a law knowable by the light of nature, i.e. without the help of positive revelation.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">从上面所说的，我认为我们可以安全地得出结论，无论任何地方的实用规则被普遍和允许地破坏，都不能被认为是与生俱来的；人们不可能毫无羞耻或恐惧，自信和平静地破坏一个他们不能但显然知道上帝已经设立的规则，并且肯定会惩罚违反者，（如果它是与生俱来的，他们必须这样做），以至于使违反者得到非常不公平的交易。如果没有这样的知识，一个人永远无法确定任何事情是他的责任。对法律的无知或怀疑，希望逃避法律制定者的知识或权力，或类似的情况，可能使人屈服于当前的食欲；但让任何一个人看到错误，并通过它的棒子，以及与违法行为一起，准备好惩罚它的火。然后告诉我，在这样的前景下，在这样确定的知识下，人们是否有可能肆无忌惮地违反他们随身携带的、不可磨灭的法律，而且在他们违反法律的时候还盯着他们的脸？当人们感到自己身上有一个全能的法律制定者的印记时，他们是否可以放心地、愉快地轻视和践踏他最神圣的禁令？最后，当一个人如此公开地藐视这个天生的法律和最高的法律制定者时，所有的旁观者，是的，甚至是人民的长官和统治者，对法律和法律制定者都充满了同样的感觉，他们是否有可能默默地纵容，而不表明他们的厌恶或对其进行丝毫指责？人的食欲中确实有行动的原则；但这些原则远远不是天生的道德原则，如果让它们充分发挥作用，它们会把人带到所有道德的颠覆中去。道德法则被设定为对这些过高欲望的遏制和约束，它们只能通过奖励和惩罚来实现，这些奖励和惩罚将抵消任何人在违反法律时向自己提出的满足。因此，如果有什么东西作为法律印在所有人的脑海中，所有人都必须有一个确定的、不可避免的知识，即违反法律将受到确定的、不可避免的惩罚。因为如果人们对先天的东西一无所知或心存疑虑，那么坚持先天的原则就毫无意义；真理和确定性（所假装的东西）根本无法通过它们得到保障；但人们在有它们和没有它们的情况下，处于同样不确定的浮动状态。对不可避免的惩罚有一个明显的认识，足以使违法行为变得非常不可接受，这必须伴随着先天的法律；除非有了先天的法律，他们也可以假设有先天的福音。我不会在这里误解，好像因为我否认先天的法律，就认为除了积极的法律之外没有其他法律。先天的法则和自然的法则之间有很大的区别，前者是在我们的头脑中印下的东西，后者是我们在不了解的情况下，通过使用和适当地应用我们的自然能力，可以获得知识的东西。我认为他们同样放弃了真理，因为他们走到了相反的极端，要么肯定先天的法律，要么否认有一种法律是可以通过自然之光，即不需要正面启示的帮助来了解的。</p>

This might with justice be expected from those men who lay stress upon this opinion; and it gives occasion to distrust either their knowledge or charity, who, declaring that God has imprinted on the minds of men the foundations of knowledge and the rules of living, are yet so little favourable to the information of their neighbours, or the quiet of mankind, as not to point out to them which they are, in the variety men are distracted with. But, in truth, were there any such innate principles there would be no need to teach them. Did men find such innate propositions stamped on their minds, they would easily be able to distinguish them from other truths that they afterwards learned and deduced from them; and there would be nothing more easy than to know what, and how many, they were. There could be no more doubt about their number than there is about the number of our fingers; and it is like then every system would be ready to give them us by tale. But since nobody, that I know, has ventured yet to give a catalogue of them, they cannot blame those who doubt of these innate principles; since even they who require men to believe that there are such innate propositions, do not tell us what they are. It is easy to foresee, that if different men of different sects should go about to give us a list of those innate practical principles, they would set down only such as suited their distinct hypotheses, and were fit to support the doctrines of their particular schools or churches; a plain evidence that there are no such innate truths. Nay, a great part of men are so far from finding any such innate moral principles in themselves, that, by denying freedom to mankind, and thereby making men no other than bare machines, they take away not only innate, but all moral rules whatsoever, and leave not a possibility to believe any such, to those who cannot conceive how anything can be capable of a law that is not a free agent. And upon that ground they must necessarily reject all principles of virtue, who cannot put MORALITY and MECHANISM together, which are not very easy to be reconciled or made consistent.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">人与人之间在实践原则方面的差异是如此明显，以至于我认为我不需要再多说什么来表明，通过这种普遍认同的标志不可能找到任何先天的道德规则；这足以让人怀疑这种先天原则的假设只是一种随心所欲的意见；因为那些如此自信地谈论它们的人却很少告诉我们它们是什么。这可以说是对那些强调这种观点的人的期望；这也让人有机会怀疑他们的知识或慈善，他们宣称上帝已经在人的头脑中打下了知识的基础和生活的规则，但却对他们的邻居的信息或人类的安静如此不利，以至于没有向他们指出，在人所困扰的各种情况下，它们是什么。但是，事实上，如果有任何这样的先天原则，就没有必要教他们。如果人们发现这种先天性的命题印在他们的脑海中，他们就会很容易地把它们与他们后来学习和推导出来的其他真理区分开来；没有什么比知道它们是什么和有多少更容易了。对它们的数量没有任何怀疑，就像对我们手指的数量没有任何怀疑一样；就像那时每个系统都会准备好通过故事给我们提供它们。但据我所知，既然还没有人敢于给出它们的目录，他们就不能责备那些怀疑这些先天原则的人；因为即使是那些要求人们相信存在这种先天命题的人，也没有告诉我们它们是什么。不难预见，如果不同教派的人去给我们列出那些先天的实践原则，他们只会列出适合他们独特假设的原则，并适合支持他们特定学校或教会的教义；这就是没有这种先天真理的明显证据。不，很多人都没有在自己身上找到任何这种先天的道德原则，以至于通过否认人类的自由，从而使人成为赤裸裸的机器，他们不仅拿走了先天的，而且拿走了所有的道德规则，对于那些无法想象不是自由人的东西怎么会有法律的人来说，他们没有可能相信任何这种规则。在这个基础上，他们必须拒绝所有的美德原则，因为他们不能把道德和机械放在一起，这不容易调和或一致。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">When I had written this, being informed that my Lord Herbert had, in his book De Veritate, assigned these innate principles, I presently consulted him, hoping to find in a man of so great parts, something that might satisfy me in this point, and put an end to my inquiry. In his chapter De Instinctu Naturali, I met with these six marks of his Notitice Communes:—1. Prioritas. 2. Independentia. 3. Universalitas. 4. Certitudo. 5. Necessitas, i. e. as he explains it, faciunt ad hominis conservationem. 6. Modus conformationis, i.e. Assensus nulla interposita mora. And at the latter end of his little treatise De Religione Laici, he says this of these innate principles: Adeo ut non uniuscujusvis religionis confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritates. Sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae, nullisque traditionibus, sive scriptis, sive non scriptis, obnoxiae, p.3 And Veritates nostrae catholicae, quae tanquam indubia Dei emata in foro interiori descriptae.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">当我写完这篇文章后，得知赫伯特勋爵在他的《真理》一书中提到了这些先天的原则，我立即向他咨询，希望能在一个如此优秀的人身上找到一些能让我在这一点上满意的东西，并结束我的调查。在他的De Instinctu Naturali一章中，我看到了他的Notitice Communes的这六个标志：1.Prioritas。2.独立性。3.普遍性。4.4. 确信。5.Necessitas，即他所解释的，faciunt ad hominis conservationem。6.6. Modus conformationis，即Assensus nulla interposita mora。在他的小论文De Religione Laici的后半部分，他对这些先天的原则是这样说的。Adeo ut non uniuscujusvis religionis confinio arctentur quae ubique vigent veritates.Sunt enim in ipsa mente caelitus descriptae, nullisque traditionibus, sive scriptis, sive non scriptis, obnoxiae, p.3 And Veritates nostrae catholicae, quae tanquam indubia Dei emata in foro interiori descriptae.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus, having given the marks of the innate principles or common notions, and asserted their being imprinted on the minds of men by the hand of God, he proceeds to set them down, and they are these:—1. Esse aliquod supremum numen. 2. Numen illud coli debere. 3. Virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimum esse rationem cultus divini. 4. Resipiscendum esse a peccatis. 5. Dari praemium vel paenam post hanc vitam transactam. Though I allow these to be clear truths, and such as, if rightly explained, a rational creature can hardly avoid giving his assent to, yet I think he is far from proving them innate impressions in foro interiori descriptae. For I must take leave to observe:—</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，在给出了先天原则或普通概念的标志，并断言它们是由上帝之手印在人的头脑中的，他接着列出了它们，它们是：-1.Esse aliquod supremum numen。2.Numen illud coli debere.3.Virtutem cum pietate conjunctam optimal esse rationem cultus divini.4.4. Resipiscendum esse a peccatis.5.5. Dari praemium vel paenam post hanc vitam transactam.虽然我认为这些都是明确的真理，而且如果解释得当，一个有理性的生物很难不表示赞同，但我认为他远远没有证明这些是内部描述中的先天印象。因为我必须注意到：-</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, that these five propositions are either not all, or more than all, those common notions written on our minds by the finger of God; if it were reasonable to believe any at all to be so written. Since there are other propositions which, even by his own rules, have as just a pretence to such an original, and may be as well admitted for innate principles, as at least some of these five he enumerates, viz. ‘Do as thou wouldst be done unto.’ And perhaps some hundreds of others, when well considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，这五个命题不是所有的，就是超过所有的，那些由上帝的手指写在我们头脑中的普通概念；如果相信有任何东西是这样写的是合理的话。因为还有其他的命题，甚至根据他自己的规则，也有同样的借口，可以作为先天的原则，至少可以接受他列举的这五个命题中的一部分，即'你愿意怎么做就怎么做'。也许还有其他几百条，如果考虑周全的话。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, that all his marks are not to be found in each of his five propositions, viz. his first, second, and third marks agree perfectly to neither of them; and the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth marks agree but ill to his third, fourth, and fifth propositions. For, besides that we are assured from history of many men, nay whole nations, who doubt or disbelieve some or all of them, I cannot see how the third, viz. “That virtue joined with piety is the best worship of God,” can be an innate principle, when the name or sound virtue, is so hard to be understood; liable to so much uncertainty in its signification; and the thing it stands for so much contended about and difficult to be known. And therefore this cannot be but a very uncertain rule of human practice, and serve but very little to the conduct of our lives, and is therefore very unfit to be assigned as an innate practical principle.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，在他的五个命题中的每一个都找不到他的所有标记，即他的第一、第二和第三标记与这两个命题都不完全一致；第一、第二、第三、第四和第六标记与他的第三、第四和第五命题不一致。因为，除了我们从历史上确信有许多人，甚至整个国家，怀疑或不相信其中的一些或全部内容外，我不明白第三条，即 "美德与虔诚相结合是对上帝最好的崇拜"，怎么会是一个天生的原则，因为美德这个名字或声音是如此难以理解，其含义是如此不确定，它所代表的东西是如此多的争论和难以知道。因此，这不能不说是人类实践的一个非常不确定的规则，对我们的生活行为作用很小，因此非常不适合被指定为一个先天的实践原则。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">For let us consider this proposition as to its meaning, (for it is the sense, and not sound, that is and must be the principle or common notion,) viz. “Virtue is the best worship of God,” i.e. is most acceptable to him; which, if virtue be taken, as most commonly it is, for those actions which, according to the different opinions of several countries, are accounted laudable, will be a proposition so far from being certain, that it will not be true. If virtue be taken for actions conformable to God’s will, or to the rule prescribed by God—which is the true and only measure of virtue when virtue is used to signify what is in its own nature right and good—then this proposition, “That virtue is the best worship of God,” will be most true and certain, but of very little use in human life: since it will amount to no more but this, viz. “That God is pleased with the doing of what he commands”;—which a man may certainly know to be true, without knowing what it is that God doth command; and so be as far from any rule or principle of his actions as he was before. And I think very few will take a proposition which amounts to no more than this, viz. “That God is pleased with the doing of what he himself commands,” for an innate moral principle written on the minds of all men, (however true and certain it may be,) since it teaches so little. Whosoever does so will have reason to think hundreds of propositions innate principles; since there are many which have as good a title as this to be received for such, which nobody yet ever put into that rank of innate principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因为让我们考虑一下这个命题的含义，（因为它是意义，而不是声音，是而且必须是原则或共同的概念，）即："美德是对上帝最好的崇拜，"即最能为他所接受；如果像最常见的那样，把美德看作是那些根据几个国家的不同意见被认为是值得称赞的行为，那么这个命题就离确定很远，它就不是真的。如果美德被认为是符合上帝旨意的行为，或符合上帝规定的规则--当美德被用来表示在其本身性质上是正确和良好的东西时，这是衡量美德的真正和唯一的标准--那么这个命题 "美德是对上帝最好的崇拜 "将是最真实和确定的，但在人类生活中却没有什么用处：因为它只相当于这个，即。"一个人当然知道这是真的，但却不知道上帝所命令的是什么；因此，他的行为与以前一样远离任何规则或原则。我认为很少有人会把一个不过如此的命题，即 "上帝喜欢做他自己命令的事"，当作写在所有人心目中的先天道德原则，（不管它多么真实和确定），因为它教的东西太少了。无论谁这样做，都有理由认为数以百计的命题是先天的原则；因为有许多命题都有这样的好名声，但却没有人把它们列入先天原则的行列。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Nor is the fourth proposition (viz. “Men must repent of their sins”) much more instructive, till what those actions are that are meant by sins be set down. For the word peccata, or sins, being put, as it usually is, to signify in general ill actions that will draw punishment upon the doers, what great principle of morality can that be to tell us we should be sorry, and cease to do that which will bring mischief upon us; without knowing what those particular actions are that will do so? Indeed this is a very true proposition, and fit to be inculcated on and received by those who are supposed to have been taught WHAT actions in all kinds ARE sins: but neither this nor the former can be imagined to be innate principles; nor to be of any use if they were innate, unless the particular measures and bounds of all virtues and vices were engraven in men’s minds, and were innate principles also, which I think is very much to be doubted. And therefore, I imagine, it will scarcely seem possible that God should engrave principles in men’s minds, in words of uncertain signification, such as VIRTUES and SINS, which amongst different men stand for different things: nay, it cannot be supposed to be in words at all, which, being in most of these principles very general names, cannot be understood but by knowing the particulars comprehended under them. And in the practical instances, the measures must be taken from the knowledge of the actions themselves, and the rules of them,—abstracted from words, and antecedent to the knowledge of names; which rules a man must know, what language soever he chance to learn, whether English or Japan, or if he should learn no language at all, or never should understand the use of words, as happens in the case of dumb and deaf men. When it shall be made out that men ignorant of words, or untaught by the laws and customs of their country, know that it is part of the worship of God not to kill another man; not to know more women than one not to procure abortion; not to expose their children; not to take from another what is his, though we want it ourselves, but on the contrary, relieve and supply his wants; and whenever we have done the contrary we ought to repent, be sorry, and resolve to do so no more;—when I say, all men shall be proved actually to know and allow all these and a thousand other such rules, all of which come under these two general words made use of above, viz. virtutes et peccata virtues and sins, there will be more reason for admitting these and the like, for common notions and practical principles. Yet, after all, universal consent (were there any in moral principles) to truths, the knowledge whereof may be attained otherwise, would scarce prove them to be innate; which is all I contend for.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第四个命题（即 "人必须为自己的罪孽忏悔"）也更有启发性，直到确定了罪孽所指的行为是什么。因为peccata或sins这个词，就像它通常表示的那样，一般是指会给行为人带来惩罚的不良行为，如果不知道那些会给我们带来祸害的具体行为是什么，那么告诉我们应该感到抱歉，并停止做那些会给我们带来祸害的事情，这又是多么伟大的道德原则？的确，这是一个非常正确的命题，适合由那些被认为已经被教导过的人灌输和接受，即各种行为都是罪过：但这和前者都不能被认为是天生的原则；如果它们是天生的，也没有任何用处，除非所有美德和恶习的具体措施和界限都刻在人们的头脑中，并且也是天生的原则，我认为这是很值得怀疑的。因此，我想，上帝几乎不可能把原则刻在人的头脑中，用含义不明确的词，如VIRTUES和SINS，它们在不同的人中代表不同的东西：不，它根本不可能被认为是用词，因为在大多数这些原则中，它们是非常一般的名字，只有知道它们下所包含的细节，才能理解。在实际的例子中，必须从行动本身的知识和行动的规则中采取措施--从文字中抽象出来，而且是在名称知识之前；一个人必须知道这些规则，无论他碰巧学什么语言，无论是英语还是日本，或者如果他根本不学语言，或者永远不懂使用文字，就像发生在哑巴和聋子身上的情况。当人们发现，不懂语言的人，或者没有被他们国家的法律和习俗教育过的人，知道不杀另一个人是崇拜上帝的一部分；不认识比一个人更多的女人，不堕胎；不暴露自己的孩子；不从别人那里拿走属于他的东西，尽管我们自己想要，但相反，缓解和供应他的需求。当我们做了相反的事情时，我们应该忏悔，感到抱歉，并决心不再这样做；--当我说，所有的人都将被证明实际上知道并允许所有这些以及其他一千条这样的规则，所有这些都属于上面使用的这两个一般的词，即。罪行和美德，就会有更多的理由接受这些和类似的东西，作为共同的概念和实践原则。然而，毕竟，对真理的普遍认同（如果在道德原则中存在的话），而这些真理的知识可以通过其他方式获得，那就很难证明它们是天生的；这就是我所主张的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Nor will it be of much moment here to offer that very ready but not very material answer, viz. that the innate principles of morality may, by education, and custom, and the general opinion of those amongst whom we converse, be darkened, and at last quite worn out of the minds of men. Which assertion of theirs, if true, quite takes away the argument of universal consent, by which this opinion of innate principles is endeavoured to be proved; unless those men will think it reasonable that their private persuasions, or that of their party, should pass for universal consent;—a thing not unfrequently done, when men, presuming themselves to be the only masters of right reason, cast by the votes and opinions of the rest of mankind as not worthy the reckoning. And then their argument stands thus:—“The principles which all mankind allow for true, are innate; those that men of right reason admit, are the principles allowed by all mankind; we, and those of our mind, are men of reason; therefore, we agreeing, our principles are innate”;—which is a very pretty way of arguing, and a short cut to infallibility. For otherwise it will be very hard to understand how there be some principles which all men do acknowledge and agree in; and yet there are none of those principles which are not, by depraved custom and ill education, blotted out of the minds of many men: which is to say, that all men admit, but yet many men do deny and dissent from them. And indeed the supposition of SUCH first principles will serve us to very little purpose; and we shall be as much at a loss with as without them, if they may, by any human power—such as the will of our teachers, or opinions of our companions—be altered or lost in us: and notwithstanding all this boast of first principles and innate light, we shall be as much in the dark and uncertainty as if there were no such thing at all: it being all one to have no rule, and one that will warp any way; or amongst various and contrary rules, not to know which is the right. But concerning innate principles, I desire these men to say, whether they can or cannot, by education and custom, be blurred and blotted out; if they cannot, we must find them in all mankind alike, and they must be clear in everybody; and if they may suffer variation from adventitious notions, we must then find them clearest and most perspicuous nearest the fountain, in children and illiterate people, who have received least impression from foreign opinions. Let them take which side they please, they will certainly find it inconsistent with visible matter of fact and daily observation.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这里，提供一个非常现成但不太重要的答案也没有什么意义，那就是道德的先天原则可能会因为教育和习俗，以及我们交谈的人的普遍意见而变得暗淡，并最终从人们的头脑中完全消失。他们的这一论断，如果是真的，就完全失去了普遍同意的论据，而这种关于先天原则的观点正是通过这种论据来证明的；除非那些人认为他们的私人劝说或他们党派的劝说应该成为普遍同意是合理的；当人们自以为是正确理性的唯一主人，把人类其他人的投票和意见视为不值得计算的时候，这种事情并非不经常发生。然后他们的论点是这样的："全人类都承认的原则是真实的，是天生的；那些具有正确理性的人所承认的原则是全人类所承认的；我们，以及我们心中的人，是具有理性的人；因此，我们同意，我们的原则是天生的"；这是一种非常漂亮的论证方式，是通往无误的捷径。因为否则就很难理解，怎么会有一些所有的人都承认并同意的原则；而这些原则却没有一个不被堕落的习俗和不良的教育从许多人的头脑中抹去：也就是说，所有的人都承认，但许多人却否认并反对它们。事实上，假设有这样的首要原则，对我们的作用不大；如果这些原则可能因任何人力--如我们老师的意愿或我们同伴的意见--而被改变或丧失，我们将像没有这些原则一样无所适从。尽管有了这些关于第一原则和先天之光的夸耀，我们仍将处于黑暗和不确定之中，就像根本不存在这样的东西一样：没有规则和一个会扭曲的规则，或者在各种相反的规则中，不知道哪个是正确的，这都是一种。但是，关于先天的原则，我希望这些人能够说，它们是否能够通过教育和习俗而被模糊和抹去；如果不能，我们必须在全人类中找到它们，它们在每个人身上都必须是清晰的；如果它们可能因外来的观念而发生变化，那么我们必须在离源头最近的地方，在儿童和文盲身上找到它们最清晰、最明确的，因为他们从外国观点中得到的印象最少。让他们选择自己喜欢的一面，他们一定会发现这与可见的事实和日常观察不一致。</p>

For such, who are careful (as they call it) to principle children well, (and few there be who have not a set of those principles for them, which they believe in,) instil into the unwary, and as yet unprejudiced, understanding, (for white paper receives any characters,) those doctrines they would have them retain and profess.

And had men leisure, parts, and will, who is there almost that dare shake the foundations of all his past thoughts and actions, and endure to bring upon himself the shame of having been a long time wholly in mistake and error? Who is there hardy enough to contend with the reproach which is everywhere prepared for those who dare venture to dissent from the received opinions of their country or party? And where is the man to be found that can patiently prepare himself to bear the name of whimsical, sceptical, or atheist; which he is sure to meet with, who does in the least scruple any of the common opinions? And he will be much more afraid to question those principles, when he shall think them, as most men do, the standards set up by God in his mind, to be the rule and touchstone of all other opinions. And what can hinder him from thinking them sacred, when he finds them the earliest of all his own thoughts, and the most reverenced by others?</p>

Whoever shall receive any of these into his mind, and entertain them there with the reverence usually paid to principles, never venturing to examine them, but accustoming himself to believe them, because they are to be believed, may take up, from his education and the fashions of his country, any absurdity for innate principles; and by long poring on the same objects, so dim his sight as to take monsters lodged in his own brain for the images of the Deity, and the workmanship of his hands.</p>

And, indeed, if it be the privilege of innate principles to be received upon their own authority, without examination, I know not what may not be believed, or how any one’s principles can be questioned. If they may and ought to be examined and tried, I desire to know how first and innate principles can be tried; or at least it is reasonable to demand the MARKS and CHARACTERS whereby the genuine innate principles may be distinguished from others: that so, amidst the great variety of pretenders, I may be kept from mistakes in so material a point as this.

Since, if the IDEAS which made up those truths were not, it was impossible that the PROPOSITIONS made up of them should be innate, or our knowledge of them be born with us. For, if the ideas be not innate, there was a time when the mind was without those principles; and then they will not be innate, but be derived from some other original.

One may perceive how, by degrees, afterwards, ideas come into their minds; and that they get no more, nor other, than what experience, and the observation of things that come in their way, furnish them with; which might be enough to satisfy us that they are not original characters stamped on the mind.</p>

But can any one think, or will any one say, that “impossibility” and “identity” are two innate IDEAS? Are they such as all mankind have, and bring into the world with them? And are they those which are the first in children, and antecedent to all acquired ones? If they are innate, they must needs be so. Hath a child an idea of impossibility and identity, before it has of white or black, sweet or bitter? And is it from the knowledge of this principle that it concludes, that wormwood rubbed on the nipple hath not the same taste that it used to receive from thence? Is it the actual knowledge of IMPOSSIBILE EST IDEM ESSE, ET NON ESSE, that makes a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger; or that makes it fond of the one and flee the other? Or does the mind regulate itself and its assent by ideas that it never yet had? Or the understanding draw conclusions from principles which it never yet knew or understood? The names IMPOSSIBILITY and IDENTITY stand for two ideas, so far from being innate, or born with us, that I think it requires great care and attention to form them right in our understandings. They are so far from being brought into the world with us, so remote from the thoughts of infancy and childhood, that I believe, upon examination it will be found that many grown men want them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">"同一事物不可能存在，也不可能不存在"，这当然是（如果有的话）一个天生的原则。但是，有人会认为，或者有人会说，"不可能 "和 "同一性 "是两个天生的观念吗？它们是所有的人都有的，并带入世界的吗？它们是那些在儿童中最先出现的，并且是所有后天获得的观念的前奏吗？如果它们是与生俱来的，它们就必须是这样。在孩子对白色或黑色、甜味或苦味有概念之前，他们是否对不可能性和特性有概念？难道是由于对这一原则的了解，它才得出结论说，在乳头上涂抹的艾草与以前从乳头上得到的味道不一样吗？是对 "不可能 "的实际了解，让孩子区分母亲和陌生人；还是让孩子喜欢一个人，逃离另一个人？还是心灵通过它从来没有过的想法来调节自己和它的同意？或者理解力从它从未知道或理解的原则中得出结论？不可能性和同一性这两个名字代表了两种观念，它们远远不是与生俱来的，也不是与生俱来的，我认为要在我们的理解中形成它们，需要非常谨慎和注意。它们远远不是与我们一起来到这个世界上的，与婴幼儿时期的想法相去甚远，我相信，经过研究，会发现许多成年人都想要它们。</p>

Whether Euphorbus and Pythagoras, having had the same soul, were the same men, though they lived several ages asunder? Nay, whether the cock too, which had the same soul, were not the same, with both of them? Whereby, perhaps, it will appear that our idea of SAMENESS is not so settled and clear as to deserve to be thought innate in us. For if those innate ideas are not clear and distinct, so as to be universally known and naturally agreed on, they cannot be subjects of universal and undoubted truths, but will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty. For, I suppose every one’s idea of identity will not be the same that Pythagoras and thousands of his followers have. And which then shall be true? Which innate? Or are there two different ideas of identity, both innate?</p>

So that if whole and part are innate ideas, extension and number must be so too; it being impossible to have an idea of a relation, without having any at all of the thing to which it belongs, and in which it is founded. Now, whether the minds of men have naturally imprinted on them the ideas of extension and number, I leave to be considered by those who are the patrons of innate principles.</p>

That the idea the term worship stands for is not in the understanding of children, and a character stamped on the mind in its first original, I think will be easily granted, by any one that considers how few there be amongst grown men who have a clear and distinct notion of it. And, I suppose, there cannot be anything more ridiculous than to say, that children have this practical principle innate, “That God is to be worshipped,” and yet that they know not what that worship of God is, which is their duty.

And though only some profligate wretches own it too barefacedly now; yet perhaps we should hear more than we do of it from others, did not the fear of the magistrate’s sword, or their neighbour’s censure, tie up people’s tongues; which, were the apprehensions of punishment or shame taken away, would as openly proclaim their atheism as their lives do.</p>

For, though no nation were to be found without a name, and some few dark notions of him, yet that would not prove them to be natural impressions on the mind; no more than the names of fire, or the sun, heat, or number, do prove the ideas they stand for to be innate; because the names of those things, and the ideas of them, are so universally received and known amongst mankind. Nor, on the contrary, is the want of such a name, or the absence of such a notion out of men’s minds, any argument against the being of a God; any more than it would be a proof that there was no loadstone in the world, because a great part of mankind had neither a notion of any such thing nor a name for it; or be any show of argument to prove that there are no distinct and various species of angels, or intelligent beings above us, because we have no ideas of such distinct species, or names for them. For, men being furnished with words, by the common language of their own countries, can scarce avoid having some kind of ideas of those things whose names those they converse with have occasion frequently to mention to them. And if they carry with it the notion of excellency, greatness, or something extraordinary; if apprehension and concernment accompany it; if the fear of absolute and irresistible power set it on upon the mind,—the idea is likely to sink the deeper, and spread the further; especially if it be such an idea as is agreeable to the common light of reason, and naturally deducible from every part of our knowledge, as that of a God is. For the visible marks of extraordinary wisdom and power appear so plainly in all the works of the creation, that a rational creature, who will but seriously reflect on them, cannot miss the discovery of a Deity. And the influence that the discovery of such a Being must necessarily have on the minds of all that have but once heard of it is so great, and carries such a weight of thought and communication with it, that it seems stranger to me that a whole nation of men should be anywhere found so brutish as to want the notion of a God, than that they should be without any notion of numbers, or fire.</p>

I doubt not but if a colony of young children should be placed in an island where no fire was, they would certainly neither have any notion of such a thing, nor name for it, how generally soever it were received and known in all the world besides; and perhaps too their apprehensions would be as far removed from any name, or notion, of a God, till some one amongst them had employed his thoughts to inquire into the constitution and causes of things, which would easily lead him to the notion of a God; which having once taught to others, reason, and the natural propensity of their own thoughts, would afterwards propagate, and continue amongst them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This argument, if it be of any force, will prove much more than those who use it in this case expect from it. For, if we may conclude that God hath done for men all that men shall judge is best for them, because it is suitable to his goodness so to do, it will prove, not only that God has imprinted on the minds of men an idea of himself, but that he hath plainly stamped there, in fair characters, all that men ought to know or believe of him; all that they ought to do in obedience to his will; and that he hath given them a will and affections conformable to it. This, no doubt, every one will think better for men, than that they should, in the dark, grope after knowledge, as St. Paul tells us all nations did after God (Acts xvii. 27); than that their wills should clash with their understandings, and their appetites cross their duty. The Romanists say it is best for men, and so suitable to the goodness of God, that there should be an infallible judge of controversies on earth; and therefore there is one. And I, by the same reason, say it is better for men that every man himself should be infallible. I leave them to consider, whether, by the force of this argument, they shall think that every man IS so. I think it a very good argument to say,—the infinitely wise God hath made it so; and therefore it is best. But it seems to me a little too much confidence of our own wisdom to say,—‘I think it best; and therefore God hath made it so.’ And in the matter in hand, it will be in vain to argue from such a topic, that God hath done so, when certain experience shows us that he hath not. But the goodness of God hath not been wanting to men, without such original impressions of knowledge or ideas stamped on the mind; since he hath furnished man with those faculties which will serve for the sufficient discovery of all things requisite to the end of such a being; and I doubt not but to show, that a man, by the right use of his natural abilities, may, without any innate principles, attain a knowledge of a God, and other things that concern him. God having endued man with those faculties of knowledge which he hath, was no more obliged by his goodness to plant those innate notions in his mind, than that, having given him reason, hands, and materials, he should build him bridges or houses,—which some people in the world, however of good parts, do either totally want, or are but ill provided of, as well as others are wholly without ideas of God and principles of morality, or at least have but very ill ones; the reason in both cases being, that they never employed their parts, faculties, and powers industriously that way, but contented themselves with the opinions, fashions, and things of their country, as they found them, without looking any further. Had you or I been born at the Bay of Soldania, possibly our thoughts and notions had not exceeded those brutish ones of the Hottentots that inhabit there. And had the Virginia king Apochancana been educated in England, he had been perhaps as knowing a divine, and as good a mathematician as any in it; the difference between him and a more improved Englishman lying barely in this, that the exercise of his faculties was bounded within the ways, modes, and notions of his own country, and never directed to any other or further inquiries. And if he had not any idea of a God, it was only because he pursued not those thoughts that would have led him to it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这个论点，如果它有任何力量，将证明比那些在本案中使用它的人所期望的更多。因为，如果我们可以得出结论，上帝为人们做了所有人们认为对他们最好的事情，因为这样做符合他的仁慈，这将证明，上帝不仅在人们的头脑中印下了对他自己的想法，而且他在那里以公平的角色明确地印下了人们应该知道或相信他的一切；他们应该顺从他的意志而做的一切；他还赋予他们符合它的意志和情感。毫无疑问，每个人都会认为这对人更好，而不是让他们在黑暗中摸索知识，就像圣保罗告诉我们所有国家都在追寻上帝（使徒行传第27章）；不是让他们的意志与他们的理解发生冲突，他们的食欲与他们的责任发生冲突。罗马教派说，对人来说是最好的，也很适合上帝的仁慈，在地球上应该有一个无懈可击的争议法官；因此，有一个。而我，基于同样的理由，说对人来说，每个人自己都应该是无懈可击的。我让他们考虑，根据这个论点的力量，他们是否会认为每个人都是如此。我认为这是一个很好的论据，即无限智慧的上帝已经这样做了；因此，这是最好的。但在我看来，说 "我认为这是最好的，因此上帝让它如此"，似乎有点太相信我们自己的智慧了。而在眼前的问题上，如果从这样的话题出发，认为上帝已经这样做了，那是徒劳的，因为某些经验告诉我们，他没有这样做。但是，上帝的仁慈对人来说并不缺乏，因为他给人配备了那些能力，这些能力将有助于充分发现这种存在的目的所需的一切事物；我毫不怀疑地表明，一个人通过正确使用他的自然能力，可以在没有任何先天原则的情况下获得对上帝和与他有关的其他事物的认识。上帝既然赋予人以他所拥有的这些知识能力，那么他的仁慈就没有义务在他的头脑中植入这些先天的观念，就像他给了他理智、双手和材料，就应该为他建造桥梁或房屋一样，而世界上有些人，无论他的身体多么好，要么完全缺乏这些东西，要么就是供应不足，就像其他人完全没有上帝的观念和道德的原则，或者至少有非常糟糕的观念。这两种情况的原因是，他们从来没有勤奋地利用他们的部分、能力和力量，而是满足于他们国家的观点、时尚和事物，因为他们发现它们，而没有进一步寻找。如果你或我出生在索尔达尼亚湾，我们的思想和观念可能不会超过居住在那里的霍屯督人的那些野蛮的思想。如果弗吉尼亚国王阿波坎卡纳在英国接受了教育，他也许和英国人一样是个有见识的神学家和优秀的数学家；他和一个更优秀的英国人之间的区别仅仅在于，他的能力的发挥被限制在他自己国家的方式、模式和观念之内，而从未被引导到任何其他或进一步的探索。如果他没有任何关于上帝的想法，那只是因为他没有追寻那些可以引导他的想法。</p>

Every deity that they owned above one was an infallible evidence of their ignorance of Him, and a proof that they had no true notion of God, where unity, infinity, and eternity were excluded. To which, if we add their gross conceptions of corporeity, expressed in their images and representations of their deities; the amours, marriages, copulations, lusts, quarrels, and other mean qualities attributed by them to their gods; we shall have little reason to think that the heathen world, i.e. the greatest part of mankind, had such ideas of God in their minds as he himself, out of care that they should not be mistaken about him, was author of. And this universality of consent, so much argued, if it prove any native impressions, it will be only this:—that God imprinted on the minds of all men speaking the same language, a NAME for himself, but not any IDEA; since those people who agreed in the name, had, at the same time, far different apprehensions about the thing signified. If they say that the variety of deities worshipped by the heathen world were but figurative ways of expressing the several attributes of that incomprehensible Being, or several parts of his providence, I answer: what they might be in the original I will not here inquire; but that they were so in the thoughts of the vulgar I think nobody will affirm. And he that will consult the voyage of the Bishop of Beryte, c. 13, (not to mention other testimonies,) will find that the theology of the Siamites professedly owns a plurality of gods: or, as the Abbe de Choisy more judiciously remarks in his Journal du Voyage de Siam, 107/177, it consists properly in acknowledging no God at all. 16.

How many even amongst us, will be found upon inquiry to fancy him in the shape of a man sitting in heaven; and to have many other absurd and unfit conceptions of him? Christians as well as Turks have had whole sects owning and contending earnestly for it,—that the Deity was corporeal, and of human shape: and though we find few now amongst us who profess themselves Anthropomorphites, (though some I have met with that own it,) yet I believe he that will make it his business may find amongst the ignorant and uninstructed Christians many of that opinion. Talk but with country people, almost of any age, or young people almost of any condition, and you shall find that, though the name of God be frequently in their mouths, yet the notions they apply this name to are so odd, low, and pitiful, that nobody can imagine they were taught by a rational man; much less that they were characters written by the finger of God himself. Nor do I see how it derogates more from the goodness of God, that he has given us minds unfurnished with these ideas of himself, than that he hath sent us into the world with bodies unclothed; and that there is no art or skill born with us. For, being fitted with faculties to attain these, it is want of industry and consideration in us, and not of bounty in him, if we have them not. It is as certain that there is a God, as that the opposite angles made by the intersection of two straight lines are equal. There was never any rational creature that set himself sincerely to examine the truth of these propositions that could fail to assent to them; though yet it be past doubt that there are many men, who, having not applied their thoughts that way, are ignorant both of the one and the other. If any one think fit to call this (which is the utmost of its extent) UNIVERSAL CONSENT, such an one I easily allow; but such an universal consent as this proves not the idea of God, any more than it does the idea of such angles, innate.</p>

Every one that hath a true idea of GOD and WORSHIP, will assent to this proposition, ‘That God is to be worshipped,’ when expressed in a language he understands; and every rational man that hath not thought on it to-day, may be ready to assent to this proposition to-morrow; and yet millions of men may be well supposed to want one or both those ideas to-day. For, if we will allow savages, and most country people, to have ideas of God and worship, (which conversation with them will not make one forward to believe,) yet I think few children can be supposed to have those ideas, which therefore they must begin to have some time or other; and then they will also begin to assent to that proposition, and make very little question of it ever after. But such an assent upon hearing, no more proves the IDEAS to be innate, than it does that one born blind (with cataracts which will be couched to-morrow) had the innate ideas of the sun, or light, or saffron, or yellow; because, when his sight is cleared, he will certainly assent to this proposition, “That the sun is lucid, or that saffron is yellow.” And therefore, if such an assent upon hearing cannot prove the ideas innate, it can much less the PROPOSITIONS made up of those ideas. If they have any innate ideas, I would be glad to be told what, and how many, they are.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">无论我们谈论先天的、推测性的或实践性的原则，都有可能说，一个人口袋里有100英镑，但却否认他有一分钱、一先令、一克朗或其他硬币来凑足这笔钱；就像认为某些提议是先天的一样，因为它们所涉及的观念绝不可能是这样的。普遍的接受和同意根本不能证明其中所表达的观念是天生的；因为在许多情况下，无论观念是如何产生的，对表达这种观念的同意或不同意的话语的同意，都必然会随之而来。每一个对上帝和崇拜有真正概念的人，当用他理解的语言表达时，都会同意这个命题：'上帝是要被崇拜的'；每一个有理性的人，今天没有想到这个问题，明天可能就会同意这个命题；然而，可以认为数以百万计的人今天都缺乏这些观念中的一个或两个。因为，如果我们允许野蛮人和大多数乡下人有关于上帝和崇拜的想法，（与他们的谈话不会让人相信），但我认为可以认为很少有孩子有这些想法，因此他们必须在某个时候开始有这些想法；然后他们也会开始同意这个命题，并在以后很少提出问题。但是，这种一听就同意的情况，并不能证明这些观念是与生俱来的，就像一个生来就瞎的人（明天会有白内障）对太阳、光、藏红花或黄色有与生俱来的观念一样；因为，当他的视力恢复后，他肯定会同意这个命题："太阳是透明的，藏红花是黄色的。"因此，如果这种听觉上的认同不能证明先天的观念，那么由这些观念组成的命题就更不能证明了。如果他们有任何先天的观念，我很想知道他们是什么，有多少。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To which let me add: if there be any innate ideas, any ideas in the mind which the mind does not actually think on, they must be lodged in the memory; and from thence must be brought into view by remembrance; i. e. must be known, when they are remembered, to have been perceptions in the mind before; unless remembrance can be without remembrance. For, to remember is to perceive anything with memory, or with a consciousness that it was perceived or known before. Without this, whatever idea comes into the mind is new, and not remembered; this consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that which distinguishes remembering from all other ways of thinking. Whatever idea was never PERCEIVED by the mind was never in the mind. Whatever idea is in the mind, is, either an actual perception, or else, having been an actual perception, is so in the mind that, by the memory, it can be made an actual perception again. Whenever there is the actual perception of any idea without memory, the idea appears perfectly new and unknown before to the understanding. Whenever the memory brings any idea into actual view, it is with a consciousness that it had been there before, and was not wholly a stranger to the mind. Whether this be not so, I appeal to every one’s observation. And then I desire an instance of an idea, pretended to be innate, which (before any impression of it by ways hereafter to be mentioned) any one could revive and remember, as an idea he had formerly known; without which consciousness of a former perception there is no remembrance; and whatever idea comes into the mind without THAT consciousness is not remembered, or comes not out of the memory, nor can be said to be in the mind before that appearance. For what is not either actually in view or in the memory, is in the mind no way at all, and is all one as if it had never been there. Suppose a child had the use of his eyes till he knows and distinguishes colours; but then cataracts shut the windows, and he is forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark; and in that time perfectly loses all memory of the ideas of colours he once had. This was the case of a blind man I once talked with, who lost his sight by the small-pox when he was a child, and had no more notion of colours than one born blind. I ask whether any one can say this man had then any ideas of colours in his mind, any more than one born blind? And I think nobody will say that either of them had in his mind any ideas of colours at all. His cataracts are couched, and then he has the ideas (which he remembers not) of colours, DE NOVO, by his restored sight, conveyed to his mind, and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance. And these now he can revive and call to mind in the dark. In this case all these ideas of colours which, when out of view, can be revived with a consciousness of a former acquaintance, being thus in the memory, are said to be in the mind. The use I make of this is,—that whatever idea, being not actually in view, is in the mind, is there only by being in the memory; and if it be not in the memory, it is not in the mind; and if it be in the memory, it cannot by the memory be brought into actual view without a perception that it comes out of the memory; which is this, that it had been known before, and is now remembered. If therefore there be any innate ideas, they must be in the memory, or else nowhere in the mind; and if they be in the memory, they can be revived without any impression from without; and whenever they are brought into the mind they are remembered, i. e. they bring with them a perception of their not being wholly new to it. This being a constant and distinguishing difference between what is, and what is not in the memory, or in the mind;—that what is not in the memory, whenever it appears there, appears perfectly new and unknown before; and what is in the memory, or in the mind, whenever it is suggested by the memory, appears not to be new, but the mind finds it in itself, and knows it was there before. By this it may be tried whether there be any innate ideas in the mind before impression from sensation or reflection. I would fain meet with the man who, when he came to the use of reason, or at any other time, remembered any of them; and to whom, after he was born, they were never new. If any one will say, there are ideas in the mind that are NOT in the memory, I desire him to explain himself, and make what he says intelligible.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">对此，让我补充一下：如果有任何先天的观念，头脑中任何没有实际思考的观念，它们就必须存放在记忆中；并从那时起必须通过记忆进入视野；也就是说，当它们被记住时，必须知道它们以前曾在头脑中感知过；除非记忆可以没有记忆。因为，记忆是用记忆来感知任何东西，或者说是用意识来感知或知道它以前的情况。如果没有这一点，无论什么想法进入头脑都是新的，而不是被记住的；这种意识到它以前曾在头脑中出现过，是记忆与所有其他思维方式的区别。凡是从来没有被头脑感知过的想法，就从来没有在头脑中。凡是在头脑中的想法，要么是一种实际的感知，要么是在头脑中曾经是一种实际的感知，通过记忆，它可以再次成为一种实际的感知。每当有任何想法的实际感知而没有记忆时，这个想法对理解力来说是完全新的和未知的。每当记忆将任何观念带入实际视野时，它就会意识到它以前就在那里，而且对头脑来说并不完全是个陌生人。是否如此，我呼吁每个人的观察。然后，我想举一个例子，说明一个被认为是与生俱来的观念，（在通过下文提到的任何方式对它产生印象之前）任何人都可以恢复并记住它，因为它是他以前知道的一个观念；如果没有对以前感知的意识，就不会有记忆；无论什么观念在没有这种意识的情况下进入头脑，都不会被记住，或者不会从记忆中出来，也不能说在出现之前已经在头脑中了。因为不在实际视野中或不在记忆中的东西，在头脑中根本不存在，都是一体的，好像它从来没有出现过。假设一个孩子在认识和分辨颜色之前一直在使用他的眼睛；但后来白内障关闭了窗户，他在黑暗中度过了40或50年；在这段时间里，他完全失去了对曾经拥有的颜色概念的所有记忆。这就是我曾经与之交谈过的一个盲人的情况，他在小时候因患水痘而失去了视力，他对颜色的概念不比天生的盲人多。我想知道，是否有人能说这个人当时在头脑中对颜色有任何想法，比天生的盲人还多？我想没有人会说他们中的任何一个人心中有任何关于颜色的想法。他的白内障被治好了，然后他就有了颜色的概念（他不记得了），通过他恢复的视力，传达给他的头脑，而且是在没有意识到以前的认识的情况下。而现在他可以在黑暗中恢复并唤起这些想法。在这种情况下，所有这些颜色的概念，在看不见的时候，可以通过对以前的认识的意识来恢复，因此在记忆中，可以说是在头脑中。我对此的解释是：不管是什么观念，只要没有实际出现在视野中，就在头脑中，只有在记忆中才会出现；如果它不在记忆中，就不在头脑中；如果它在记忆中，就不能通过记忆进入实际视野，而不能感知到它是从记忆中出来的；这就是，它以前曾被认识过，现在被记住了。因此，如果有任何先天的观念，它们必须在记忆中，否则就不在头脑中；如果它们在记忆中，它们可以在没有任何外来印象的情况下被唤醒；而且只要它们被带入头脑，它们就会被记住，也就是说，它们会带来一种感知，即它们对头脑来说并非完全是新的。这是在记忆中或头脑中的东西和不在记忆中的东西之间的一个恒定的区别；不在记忆中的东西，只要它出现在那里，就显得完全是新的和未知的；而在记忆中或头脑中的东西，只要它被记忆所暗示，就显得不是新的，但头脑在自己身上发现它，并知道它以前就在那里。通过这一点，我们可以检验一下，在感觉或思考产生的印象之前，头脑中是否有任何先天的观念。我很想见见这样的人：当他开始使用理性的时候，或者在其他任何时候，他都记得其中的任何东西；而在他出生后，这些东西对他来说从来不是新的。如果有人说，脑海中有一些不在记忆中的想法，我希望他能解释一下，并使他所说的内容能够理解。</p>

For, to what purpose should characters be graven on the mind by the finger of God, which are not clearer there than those which are afterwards introduced, or cannot be distinguished from them? If any one thinks there are such innate ideas and propositions, which by their clearness and usefulness are distinguishable from all that is adventitious in the mind and acquired, it will not be a hard matter for him to tell us WHICH THEY ARE; and then every one will be a fit judge whether they be so or no. Since if there be such innate ideas and impressions, plainly different from all other perceptions and knowledge, every one will find it true in himself.

		<p class="calibre5 en">To conclude: some ideas forwardly offer themselves to all men’s understanding; and some sorts of truths result from any ideas, as soon as the mind puts them into propositions: other truths require a train of ideas placed in order, a due comparing of them, and deductions made with attention, before they can be discovered and assented to. Some of the first sort, because of their general and easy reception, have been mistaken for innate: but the truth is, ideas and notions are no more born with us than arts and sciences; though some of them indeed offer themselves to our faculties more readily than others; and therefore are more generally received: though that too be according as the organs of our bodies and powers of our minds happen to be employed; God having fitted men with faculties and means to discover, receive, and retain truths, according as they are employed. The great difference that is to be found in the notions of mankind is, from the different use they put their faculties to. Whilst some (and those the most) taking things upon trust, misemploy their power of assent, by lazily enslaving their minds to the dictates and dominion of others, in doctrines which it is their duty carefully to examine, and not blindly, with an implicit faith, to swallow; others, employing their thoughts only about some few things, grow acquainted sufficiently with them, attain great degrees of knowledge in them, and are ignorant of all other, having never let their thoughts loose in the search of other inquiries. Thus, that the three angles of a triangle are quite equal to two right ones is a truth as certain as anything can be, and I think more evident than many of those propositions that go for principles; and yet there are millions, however expert in other things, who know not this at all, because they never set their thoughts on work about such angles. And he that certainly knows this proposition may yet be utterly ignorant of the truth of other propositions, in mathematics itself, which are as clear and evident as this; because, in his search of those mathematical truths, he stopped his thoughts short and went not so far. The same may happen concerning the notions we have of the being of a Deity. For, though there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to himself than the existence of a God, yet he that shall content himself with things as he finds them in this world, as they minister to his pleasures and passions, and not make inquiry a little further into their causes, ends, and admirable contrivances, and pursue the thoughts thereof with diligence and attention, may live long without any notion of such a Being. And if any person hath by talk put such a notion into his head, he may perhaps believe it; but if he hath never examined it, his knowledge of it will be no perfecter than his, who having been told, that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones, takes it upon trust, without examining the demonstration; and may yield his assent as a probable opinion, but hath no knowledge of the truth of it; which yet his faculties, if carefully employed, were able to make clear and evident to him. But this only, by the by, to show how much OUR KNOWLEDGE DEPENDS UPON THE RIGHT USE OF THOSE POWERS NATURE HATH BESTOWED UPON US, and how little upon SUCH INNATE PRINCIPLES AS ARE IN VAIN SUPPOSED TO BE IN ALL MANKIND FOR THEIR DIRECTION; which all men could not but know if they were there, or else they would be there to no purpose. And which since all men do not know, nor can distinguish from other adventitious truths, we may well conclude there are no such.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">总结：有些观念会直接提供给所有人理解；有些真理是由任何观念产生的，只要头脑中把它们变成命题：其他真理则需要把一连串的观念放在一起，对它们进行适当的比较，并用心进行推导，然后才能发现和赞同。第一类中的一些，因为它们普遍而容易被接受，所以被误认为是与生俱来的：但事实是，观念和概念并不比艺术和科学更与生俱来；尽管其中一些确实比其他的更容易提供给我们的能力；因此更普遍地被接受：尽管这也是根据我们身体的器官和我们思想的力量碰巧被使用；上帝为人们配备了各种能力和手段，根据他们的使用情况来发现、接受和保留真理。在人类的观念中可以发现的最大差异是，他们对自己的能力的不同使用。有些人（而且是最多的人）把事情托付给别人，错误地利用了他们的同意能力，懒洋洋地把他们的思想束缚在别人的口令和统治之下，而他们的责任是仔细研究这些教义，而不是盲目地、含蓄地接受这些教义；其他人只对一些少数事物运用他们的思想，对这些事物有了足够的了解，在这些事物上达到了很大的知识程度，而对其他一切都一无所知，因为他们从未把思想放开，去寻找其他问题。因此，三角形的三个角完全等于两个直角，这是一个可以确定的真理，我认为比许多作为原则的命题更明显；然而，有数以百万计的人，无论他们在其他方面多么专业，都不知道这一点，因为他们从来没有把他们的思想放在关于这种角的工作上。当然知道这个命题的人可能完全不知道其他命题的真相，在数学本身中，这些命题和这个命题一样清晰明了；因为在寻找这些数学真理的过程中，他的思想停滞不前，没有走到这一步。同样的情况也可能发生在我们对神性的存在的概念上。因为，尽管没有什么真理能比上帝的存在更明显地让人明白，但如果他满足于他在这个世界上发现的事物，因为它们满足了他的快乐和激情，而不进一步探究它们的原因、目的和令人钦佩的设计，并勤奋和专注地追求其中的思想，他就可能长期生活在没有任何关于这种存在的概念中。如果有人通过谈话把这样的概念灌输给他，他也许会相信它；但如果他从来没有研究过，他对它的认识不会比他更完美，因为他被告知，一个三角形的三个角等于两个直角，他相信它，而不去研究证明；他可能会同意一个可能的意见，但不知道它的真相；但他的能力，如果仔细使用，能够使他清楚和明显的认识。但这只是为了说明，我们的知识在多大程度上取决于正确使用自然赋予我们的那些能力，而在多大程度上取决于那些被认为存在于所有人类中以指导他们的固有原则；如果这些原则存在，所有人都不能不知道，否则他们就会毫无意义。既然所有人都不知道，也无法与其他偶然的真理区分开来，我们完全可以断定没有这样的真理。</p>

This I am certain, I have not made it my business either to quit or follow any authority in the ensuing Discourse. Truth has been my only aim; and wherever that has appeared to lead, my thoughts have impartially followed, without minding whether the footsteps of any other lay that way or not. Not that I want a due respect to other men’s opinions; but, after all, the greatest reverence is due to truth: and I hope it will not be thought arrogance to say, that perhaps we should make greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative knowledge, if we sought it in the fountain, IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THINGS THEMSELVES; and made use rather of our own thoughts than other men’s to find it. For I think we may as rationally hope to see with other men’s eyes, as to know by other men’s understandings. So much as we ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason, so much we possess of real and true knowledge. The floating of other men’s opinions in our brains, makes us not one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true. What in them was science, is in us but opiniatrety; whilst we give up our assent only to reverend names, and do not, as they did, employ our own reason to understand those truths which gave them reputation. Aristotle was certainly a knowing man, but nobody ever thought him so because he blindly embraced, and confidently vented the opinions of another. And if the taking up of another’s principles, without examining them, made not him a philosopher, I suppose it will hardly make anybody else so. In the sciences, every one has so much as he really knows and comprehends. What he believes only, and takes upon trust, are but shreds; which, however well in the whole piece, make no considerable addition to his stock who gathers them. Such borrowed wealth, like fairy money, though it were gold in the hand from which he received it, will be but leaves and dust when it comes to use.</p>

This being once received, it eased the lazy from the pains of search, and stopped the inquiry of the doubtful concerning all that was once styled innate. And it was of no small advantage to those who affected to be masters and teachers, to make this the principle of principles,—THAT PRINCIPLES MUST NOT BE QUESTIONED. For, having once established this tenet,—that there are innate principles, it put their followers upon a necessity of receiving SOME doctrines as such; which was to take them off from the use of their own reason and judgment, and put them on believing and taking them upon trust without further examination: in which posture of blind credulity, they might be more easily governed by, and made useful to some sort of men, who had the skill and office to principle and guide them. Nor is it a small power it gives one man over another, to have the authority to be the dictator of principles, and teacher of unquestionable truths; and to make a man swallow that for an innate principle which may serve to his purpose who teacheth them. Whereas had they examined the ways whereby men came to the knowledge of many universal truths, they would have found them to result in the minds of men from the being of things themselves, when duly considered; and that they were discovered by the application of those faculties that were fitted by nature to receive and judge of them, when duly employed about them.</p>

And since the arguments which are against them do, some of them, rise from common received opinions, I have been forced to take several things for granted; which is hardly avoidable to any one, whose task is to show the falsehood or improbability of any tenet;—it happening in controversial discourses as it does in assaulting of towns; where, if the ground be but firm whereon the batteries are erected, there is no further inquiry of whom it is borrowed, nor whom it belongs to, so it affords but a fit rise for the present purpose. But in the future part of this Discourse, designing to raise an edifice uniform and consistent with itself, as far as my own experience and observation will assist me, I hope to erect it on such a basis that I shall not need to shore it up with props and buttresses, leaning on borrowed or begged foundations: or at least, if mine prove a castle in the air, I will endeavour it shall be all of a piece and hang together. Wherein I warn the reader not to expect undeniable cogent demonstrations, unless I may be allowed the privilege, not seldom assumed by others, to take my principles for granted; and then, I doubt not, but I can demonstrate too. All that I shall say for the principles I proceed on is, that I can only appeal to men’s own unprejudiced experience and observation whether they be true or not; and this is enough for a man who professes no more than to lay down candidly and freely his own conjectures, concerning a subject lying somewhat in the dark, without any other design than an unbiassed inquiry after truth.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the IDEAS that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,—such as are those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others: it is in the first place then to be inquired, HOW HE COMES BY THEM?</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">每个人都意识到自己在思考，而他在思考时应用的东西就是那里的观念，毫无疑问，人的头脑中有几个观念--如白、硬、甜、思考、运动、人、大象、军队、醉酒等词语所表达的那些观念：那么首先要问的是，他是怎么来的？</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">I know it is a received doctrine, that men have native ideas, and original characters, stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose what I have said in the foregoing Book will be much more easily admitted, when I have shown whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has; and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mind;—for which I shall appeal to every one’s own observation and experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我知道这是一个公认的学说，即人在最初存在的时候就有自己的想法和原始性格，并印在他们的头脑中。我已经对这一观点进行了广泛的研究；我想，当我说明理解力从何而来，以及它们以何种方式和程度进入头脑时，我在前面的书中所说的话将更容易被接受；为此我将呼吁每个人自己的观察和经验。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">2.2.所有思想都来自于感觉或反映。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:—How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the MATERIALS of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies our understandings with all the MATERIALS of thinking. These two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">那么，让我们假设心灵就像我们说的那样，是一张白纸，没有任何字符，没有任何思想：--它是如何被填充的呢？它是怎么来的呢？它是由人的忙碌和无边的想象力在上面画出的几乎是无穷无尽的种类而形成的巨大的储存物而来的？它的所有理性和知识的材料从何而来？对此，我的回答是，一个字，来自经验。我们所有的知识都是建立在经验之上的；而且它最终也是来自经验。我们对外部可感知物体的观察，或对我们自己所感知和反映的头脑内部运作的观察，都是为我们的理解提供了所有的思维材料。这两者是知识的源泉，我们所拥有的或可以自然拥有的所有观念都来自于此。</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">3.感觉的对象是思想的来源之一</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we come by those IDEAS we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions. This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我们的感官，对特定的可感对象感兴趣，根据这些对象对它们产生影响的不同方式，将对事物的几种不同看法传达给头脑。因此，我们对黄、白、热、冷、软、硬、苦、甜，以及所有我们称之为感性品质的东西，都产生了这些观念；当我说感官传入心灵时，我的意思是，它们从外部物体传入心灵，在那里产生这些感知。我们所拥有的大多数观念的这一伟大来源，完全取决于我们的感官，并由它们衍生到理解力，我称之为感性。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">

		<p class="calibre5 en">4. The Operations of our Minds, the other Source of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">4.我们心灵的运作，是它们的另一个来源。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,—the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;—which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;—which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called INTERNAL SENSE. But as I call the other Sensation, so I call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings. The term OPERATIONS here I use in a large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，经验为理解力提供观念的另一个源泉是：感知我们自己的思想在我们内部的运作，因为它是关于它所得到的观念的；这些运作，当灵魂来思考和考虑时，确实为理解力提供了另一套观念，这是从外部事物中无法得到的。这就是感知、思考、怀疑、相信、推理、知道、愿意，以及我们自己头脑中的所有不同行为；我们意识到这些行为，并在自己身上观察到这些行为，就像我们从影响我们感官的物体中得到不同的观念一样，从这些观念中得到我们的理解。这种观念的来源，每个人都完全在自己体内；虽然它不是感觉，因为它与外部物体无关，但它非常像它，可以适当地称为内部感觉。但是，正如我把另一种感觉称为 "感觉"，我也把它称为 "反思"，它所提供的观念只是心灵通过反思自己的内部运作而获得的。那么，在本论述的以下部分中，我所说的反思，将被理解为：心灵对其自身的运作及其方式的注意，由于这种注意，在理解中产生了关于这些运作的观念。我说，这两个，即外部物质事物，作为感性的对象，以及我们自己的头脑的运作，作为反思的对象，对我来说是唯一的原点，我们所有的观念都是从这里开始的。我在这里使用的 "行动 "一词，从广义上讲，不仅包括心灵对其观念的行动，还包括有时由其产生的某种激情，如由任何思想产生的满足或不安。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">5. All our Ideas are of the one or of the other of these.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">5.我们所有的想法都是属于这其中的一种或另一种。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two. EXTERNAL OBJECTS furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities, which are all those different perceptions they produce in us; and THE MIND furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我看来，理解力如果不是从这两者之一得到的，就不会有任何想法的闪光点。外部物体为心灵提供了感性品质的观念，也就是它们在我们身上产生的所有不同的感知；而心灵则为理解力提供了关于其自身运作的观念。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">These, when we have taken a full survey of them, and their several modes, and the compositions made out of them we shall find to contain all our whole stock of ideas; and that we have nothing in our minds which did not come in one of these two ways. Let any one examine his own thoughts, and thoroughly search into his understanding; and then let him tell me, whether all the original ideas he has there, are any other than of the objects of his senses, or of the operations of his mind, considered as objects of his reflection. And how great a mass of knowledge soever he imagines to be lodged there, he will, upon taking a strict view, see that he has not any idea in his mind but what one of these two have imprinted;—though perhaps, with infinite variety compounded and enlarged by the understanding, as we shall see hereafter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">当我们对它们进行了全面的调查，以及它们的几种模式和由它们组成的作品时，我们会发现它们包含了我们所有的观念；而且我们的头脑中没有任何东西不是通过这两种方式之一产生的。让任何一个人检查他自己的思想，并彻底搜查他的理解力；然后让他告诉我，他在那里拥有的所有原始观念，除了是他的感官对象，或者是他的思想活动，被视为他思考的对象之外，是否还有其他的观念。无论他想象中的知识总量有多大，只要仔细观察，他就会发现，除了这两种观念中的一种所印证的东西，他的头脑中没有任何观念；尽管可能有无限的多样性，被理解力所复合和扩大，正如我们将在下文中看到。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">He that attentively considers the state of a child, at his first coming into the world, will have little reason to think him stored with plenty of ideas, that are to be the matter of his future knowledge. It is BY DEGREES he comes to be furnished with them. And though the ideas of obvious and familiar qualities imprint themselves before the memory begins to keep a register of time or order, yet it is often so late before some unusual qualities come in the way, that there are few men that cannot recollect the beginning of their acquaintance with them. And if it were worth while, no doubt a child might be so ordered as to have but a very few, even of the ordinary ideas, till he were grown up to a man. But all that are born into the world, being surrounded with bodies that perpetually and diversely affect them, variety of ideas, whether care be taken of it or not, are imprinted on the minds of children. Light and colours are busy at hand everywhere, when the eye is but open; sounds and some tangible qualities fail not to solicit their proper senses, and force an entrance to the mind;—but yet, I think, it will be granted easily, that if a child were kept in a place where he never saw any other but black and white till he were a man, he would have no more ideas of scarlet or green, than he that from his childhood never tasted an oyster, or a pine-apple, has of those particular relishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果仔细考虑一下孩子刚来到这个世界时的状况，就会发现他没有什么理由认为他储存了大量的思想，而这些思想是他未来知识的来源。他是通过不同的等级来获得这些知识的。尽管在记忆开始记录时间或秩序之前，明显的和熟悉的品质的想法就已经打上了印记，但在一些不寻常的品质出现之前，往往已经很晚了，很少有人能回忆起他们认识这些品质的开始。如果值得的话，毫无疑问，一个孩子在长大成人之前，可能会被安排得只拥有很少的，甚至是普通的想法。但是，所有出生在这个世界上的人，都被永远影响他们的身体所包围，各种各样的想法，无论是否注意到，都会在孩子们的头脑中留下烙印。只要眼睛一睁开，光线和颜色就会随处可见；声音和一些有形的品质也会吸引他们适当的感官，并强行进入大脑；但是，我想，人们很容易就会同意，如果一个孩子被关在一个除了黑和白之外从未见过其他东西的地方，直到他长大成人，他对红色或绿色的想法也不会多于从小就没有尝过牡蛎或松树苹果的人对这些特别的味道的想法。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Men then come to be furnished with fewer or more simple ideas from without, according as the objects they converse with afford greater or less variety; and from the operations of their minds within, according as they more or less reflect on them. For, though he that contemplates the operations of his mind, cannot but have plain and clear ideas of them; yet, unless he turn his thoughts that way, and considers them ATTENTIVELY, he will no more have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind, and all that may be observed therein, than he will have all the particular ideas of any landscape, or of the parts and motions of a clock, who will not turn his eyes to it, and with attention heed all the parts of it. The picture, or clock may be so placed, that they may come in his way every day; but yet he will have but a confused idea of all the parts they are made up of, till he applies himself with attention, to consider them each in particular.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这样，人们就会从外部获得更少或更多的简单想法，因为他们与之交谈的对象提供了更多或更少的多样性；从他们内心的思维活动中获得更多或更少的思考。因为，尽管思考他的思想活动的人，不能不对它们有简单而清晰的想法；但是，除非他把他的思想转向那边，并专心致志地考虑它们，否则他不会对他思想的所有活动以及其中可能观察到的一切有清晰而明确的想法，就像他不会对任何风景或时钟的部件和运动有所有特定的想法，他不会把眼睛转向它，并注意它的所有部件。这幅画或一个钟可能被放置得很好，以至于它们每天都会出现在他的面前；但他对它们所组成的所有部分只会有一个混乱的概念，直到他用心去考虑它们的每一个部分。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">And hence we see the reason why it is pretty late before most children get ideas of the operations of their own minds; and some have not any very clear or perfect ideas of the greatest part of them all their lives. Because, though they pass there continually, yet, like floating visions, they make not deep impressions enough to leave in their mind clear, distinct, lasting ideas, till the understanding turns inward upon itself, reflects on its own operations, and makes them the objects of its own contemplation. Children when they come first into it, are surrounded with a world of new things which, by a constant solicitation of their senses, draw the mind constantly to them; forward to take notice of new, and apt to be delighted with the variety of changing objects. Thus the first years are usually employed and diverted in looking abroad. Men’s business in them is to acquaint themselves with what is to be found without; and so growing up in a constant attention to outward sensations, seldom make any considerable reflection on what passes within them, till they come to be of riper years; and some scarce ever at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我们看到，为什么大多数孩子很晚才对他们自己的思想运作有了概念；而且有些孩子一生中对其中的大部分都没有任何非常清晰或完美的概念。因为，尽管它们不断地在那里经过，但就像漂浮的幻象一样，它们没有留下足够深刻的印象，以至于在他们的头脑中留下清晰、明确、持久的想法，直到理解力转向自身，反思自己的操作，并使它们成为自己思考的对象。孩子们刚进入这个世界时，被一个新事物的世界所包围，这些新事物通过对他们的感官的不断吸引，不断地把他们的思想吸引过来；向前看，注意新事物，并对各种变化的对象感到高兴。因此，最初的几年通常都是在向外看的过程中使用和转移注意力。人们在这些年里的任务是熟悉外面的事物；因此，在不断关注外在感觉的过程中成长起来的人，很少对他们内部的事物进行任何重要的思考，直到他们年岁渐长；而且有些人根本就没有思考过。</p>

I know it is an opinion, that the soul always thinks, and that it has the actual perception of ideas in itself constantly, as long as it exists; and that actual thinking is as inseparable from the soul as actual extension is from the body; which if true, to inquire after the beginning of a man’s ideas is the same as to inquire after the beginning of his soul.

		<p class="calibre5 en">But whether the soul be supposed to exist antecedent to, or coeval with, or some time after the first rudiments of organization, or the beginnings of life in the body, I leave to be disputed by those who have better thought of that matter. I confess myself to have one of those dull souls, that doth not perceive itself always to contemplate ideas; nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to think, than for the body always to move: the perception of ideas being (as I conceive) to the soul, what motion is to the body; not its essence, but one of its operations. And therefore, though thinking be supposed never so much the proper action of the soul, yet it is not necessary to suppose that it should be always thinking, always in action. That, perhaps, is the privilege of the infinite Author and Preserver of all things, who “never slumbers nor sleeps”; but is not competent to any finite being, at least not to the soul of man. We know certainly, by experience, that we SOMETIMES think; and thence draw this infallible consequence,—that there is something in us that has a power to think. But whether that substance PERPETUALLY thinks or no, we can be no further assured than experience informs us. For, to say that actual thinking is essential to the soul, and inseparable from it, is to beg what is in question, and not to prove it by reason;—which is necessary to be done, if it be not a self-evident proposition. But whether this, “That the soul always thinks,” be a self-evident proposition, that everybody assents to at first hearing, I appeal to mankind. It is doubted whether I thought at all last night or no. The question being about a matter of fact, it is begging it to bring, as a proof for it, an hypothesis, which is the very thing in dispute: by which way one may prove anything, and it is but supposing that all watches, whilst the balance beats, think, and it is sufficiently proved, and past doubt, that my watch thought all last night. But he that would not deceive himself, ought to build his hypothesis on matter of fact, and make it out by sensible experience, and not presume on matter of fact, because of his hypothesis, that is, because he supposes it to be so; which way of proving amounts to this, that I must necessarily think all last night, because another supposes I always think, though I myself cannot perceive that I always do so.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，灵魂是否被认为存在于组织的最初雏形或身体生命的开端之前，或与之共生，或在之后的某个时间存在，我让那些对该问题有更好想法的人去争论吧。我承认我的灵魂很迟钝，它不认为自己总是在思考理念；也不认为灵魂总是思考比身体总是运动更有必要：（我认为）对理念的认识对灵魂来说，就像运动对身体一样；不是它的本质，而是它的操作之一。因此，尽管思考被认为从来不是灵魂的适当行动，但也没有必要认为它应该总是在思考，总是在行动。这也许是无限的作者和万物的保护者的特权，他 "从不打瞌睡，也不睡觉"；但对任何有限的生命来说，至少对人的灵魂来说是不合适的。根据经验，我们当然知道，我们有时会思考；并由此得出这个无可置疑的结论--我们体内有某种东西具有思考的能力。但是，无论这种物质是否真正思考，我们都不能比经验告诉我们的更有把握。因为，说实际思维是灵魂的基本要素，与灵魂不可分割，是对问题的乞求，而不是用理性来证明它；如果这不是一个不言而喻的命题，那就必须这样做。但是，"灵魂总是在思考 "这个命题是否是一个不言自明的命题，每个人一听就会同意，我向人类呼吁。有人怀疑我昨晚到底有没有思考。这个问题是关于一个事实的，如果把一个假设作为它的证明，那就是在讨好它，而这个假设正是争论的焦点：通过这种方式，人们可以证明任何事情，这不过是假设所有的手表在天平跳动时都在思考，这就充分证明了，而且是毫无疑问的，我的手表昨晚一直在思考。但是，不愿意欺骗自己的人，应该把他的假设建立在事实的基础上，并通过感性的经验加以证明，而不是因为他的假设，也就是因为他假设是这样的，就对事实进行推测；这种证明方式相当于这样：我昨天晚上一定在思考，因为别人假设我总是在思考，尽管我自己无法觉察到我总是这样做。</p>

How else could any one make it an inference of mine, that a thing is not, because we are not sensible of it in our sleep? I do not say there is no SOUL in a man, because he is not sensible of it in his sleep; but I do say, he cannot THINK at any time, waking or sleeping, without being sensible of it. Our being sensible of it is not necessary to anything but to our thoughts; and to them it is; and to them it always will be necessary, till we can think without being conscious of it.</p>

But whether sleeping without dreaming be not an affection of the whole man, mind as well as body, may be worth a waking man’s consideration; it being hard to conceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it. If the soul doth think in a sleeping man without being conscious of it, I ask whether, during such thinking, it has any pleasure or pain, or be capable of happiness or misery? I am sure the man is not; no more than the bed or earth he lies on. For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it, seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible. Or if it be possible that the SOUL can, whilst the body is sleeping, have its thinking, enjoyments, and concerns, its pleasures or pain, apart, which the MAN is not conscious of nor partakes in,—it is certain that Socrates asleep and Socrates awake is not the same person; but his soul when he sleeps, and Socrates the man, consisting of body and soul, when he is waking, are two persons: since waking Socrates has no knowledge of, or concernment for that happiness or misery of his soul, which it enjoys alone by itself whilst he sleeps, without perceiving anything of it; no more than he has for the happiness or misery of a man in the Indies, whom he knows not. For, if we take wholly away all consciousness of our actions and sensations, especially of pleasure and pain, and the concernment that accompanies it, it will be hard to know wherein to place personal identity.</p>

Whilst it thinks and perceives, it is capable certainly of those of delight or trouble, as well as any other perceptions; and IT must necessarily be CONSCIOUS of its own perceptions. But it has all this apart: the sleeping MAN, it is plain, is conscious of nothing of all this. Let us suppose, then, the soul of Castor, while he is sleeping, retired from his body; which is no impossible supposition for the men I have here to do with, who so liberally allow life, without a thinking soul, to all other animals. These men cannot then judge it impossible, or a contradiction, that the body should live without the soul; nor that the soul should subsist and think, or have perception, even perception of happiness or misery, without the body. Let us then, I say, suppose the soul of Castor separated during his sleep from his body, to think apart. Let us suppose, too, that it chooses for its scene of thinking the body of another man, v. g. Pollux, who is sleeping without a soul. For, if Castor’s soul can think, whilst Castor is asleep, what Castor is never conscious of, it is no matter what PLACE it chooses to think in. We have here, then, the bodies of two men with only one soul between them, which we will suppose to sleep and wake by turns; and the soul still thinking in the waking man, whereof the sleeping man is never conscious, has never the least perception. I ask, then, whether Castor and Pollux, thus with only one soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two as distinct PERSONS as Castor and Hercules, or as Socrates and Plato were? And whether one of them might not be very happy, and the other very miserable? Just by the same reason, they make the soul and the man two persons, who make the soul think apart what the man is not conscious of. For, I suppose nobody will make identity of persons to consist in the soul’s being united to the very same numerical particles of matter. For if that be necessary to identity, it will be impossible, in that constant flux of the particles of our bodies, that any man should be the same person two days, or two moments, together.</p>

For who can without any more ado, but being barely told so, imagine that the greatest part of men do, during all their lives, for several hours every day, think of something, which if they were asked, even in the middle of these thoughts, they could remember nothing at all of? Most men, I think, pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming. I once knew a man that was bred a scholar, and had no bad memory, who told me he had never dreamed in his life, till he had that fever he was then newly recovered of, which was about the five or six and twentieth year of his age.

		<p class="calibre5 en">To think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very useless sort of thinking; and the soul, in such a state of thinking, does very little, if at all, excel that of a looking-glass, which constantly receives variety of images, or ideas, but retains none; they disappear and vanish, and there remain no footsteps of them; the looking-glass is never the better for such ideas, nor the soul for, such thoughts. Perhaps it will be said, that in a waking MAN the materials of the body are employed, and made use of, in thinking; and that the memory of thoughts is retained by the impressions that are made on the brain, and the traces there left after such thinking; but that in the thinking of the SOUL, which is not perceived in a sleeping man, there the soul thinks apart, and making no use of the organs of the body, leaves no impressions on it, and consequently no memory of such thoughts. Not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct persons, which follows from this supposition, I answer, further,—That whatever ideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body, it is reasonable to conclude it can retain without the help of the body too; or else the soul, or any separate spirit, will have but little advantage by thinking. If it has no memory of its own thoughts; if it cannot lay them up for its own use, and be able to recall them upon occasion; if it cannot reflect upon what is past, and make use of its former experiences, reasonings, and contemplations, to what, purpose does it think? They who make the soul a thinking thing, at this rate, will not make it a much more noble being than those do whom they condemn, for allowing it to be nothing but the subtilist parts of matter. Characters drawn on dust, that the first breath of wind effaces; or impressions made on a heap of atoms, or animal spirits, are altogether as useful, and render the subject as noble, as the thoughts of a soul that perish in thinking; that, once out of sight, are gone for ever, and leave no memory of themselves behind them. Nature never makes excellent things for mean or no uses: and it is hardly to be conceived that our infinitely wise Creator should make so admirable a faculty as the power of thinking, that faculty which comes nearest the excellency of his own incomprehensible being, to be so idly and uselessly employed, at least a fourth part of its time here, as to think constantly, without remembering any of those thoughts, without doing any good to itself or others, or being any way useful to any other part of the creation.

The dreams of sleeping men are, as I take it, all made up of the waking man’s ideas; though for the most part oddly put together. It is strange, if the soul has ideas of its own that it derived not from sensation or reflection, (as it must have, if it thought before it received any impressions from the body,) that it should never, in its private thinking, (so private, that the man himself perceives it not,) retain any of them the very moment it wakes out of them, and then make the man glad with new discoveries. Who can find it reason that the soul should, in its retirement during sleep, have so many hours’ thoughts, and yet never light on any of those ideas it borrowed not from sensation or reflection; or at least preserve the memory of none but such, which, being occasioned from the body, must needs be less natural to a spirit? It is strange the soul should never once in a man’s whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts, and those ideas it had before it borrowed anything from the body; never bring into the waking man’s view any other ideas but what have a tang of the cask, and manifestly derive their original from that union. If it always thinks, and so had ideas before it was united, or before it received any from the body, it is not to be supposed but that during sleep it recollects its native ideas; and during that retirement from communicating with the body, whilst it thinks by itself, the ideas it is busied about should be, sometimes at least, those more natural and congenial ones which it had in itself, underived from the body, or its own operations about them: which, since the waking man never remembers, we must from this hypothesis conclude either that the soul remembers something that the man does not; or else that memory belongs only to such ideas as are derived from the body, or the mind’s operations about them.</p>

And if one considers well these men’s way of speaking, one should be led into a suspicion that they do so. For those who tell us that the SOUL always thinks, do never, that I remember, say that a MAN always thinks. Can the soul think, and not the man? Or a man think, and not be conscious of it? This, perhaps, would be suspected of jargon in others. If they say the man thinks always, but is not always conscious of it, they may as well say his body is extended without having parts. For it is altogether as intelligible to say that a body is extended without parts, as that anything thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving that it does so. They who talk thus may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their hypothesis, say that a man is always hungry, but that he does not always feel it; whereas hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking consists in being conscious that one thinks. If they say that a man is always conscious to himself of thinking, I ask, How they know it? Consciousness is the perception of what passes in a man’s own mind. Can another man perceive that I am conscious of anything, when I perceive it not myself? No man’s knowledge here can go beyond his experience. Wake a man out of a sound sleep, and ask him what he was that moment thinking of. If he himself be conscious of nothing he then thought on, he must be a notable diviner of thoughts that can assure him that he was thinking. May he not, with more reason, assure him he was not asleep? This is something beyond philosophy; and it cannot be less than revelation, that discovers to another thoughts in my mind, when I can find none there myself. And they must needs have a penetrating sight who can certainly see that I think, when I cannot perceive it myself, and when I declare that I do not; and yet can see that dogs or elephants do not think, when they give all the demonstration of it imaginable, except only telling us that they do so. This some may suspect to be a step beyond the Rosicrucians; it seeming easier to make one’s self invisible to others, than to make another’s thoughts visible to me, which are not visible to himself. But it is but defining the soul to be “a substance that always thinks,” and the business is done. If such definition be of any authority, I know not what it can serve for but to make many men suspect that they have no souls at all; since they find a good part of their lives pass away without thinking. For no definitions that I know, no suppositions of any sect, are of force enough to destroy constant experience; and perhaps it is the affectation of knowing beyond what we perceive, that makes so much useless dispute and noise in the world.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Follow a child from its birth, and observe the alterations that time makes, and you shall find, as the mind by the senses comes more and more to be furnished with ideas, it comes to be more and more awake; thinks more, the more it has matter to think on. After some time it begins to know the objects which, being most familiar with it, have made lasting impressions. Thus it comes by degrees to know the persons it daily converses with, and distinguishes them from strangers; which are instances and effects of its coming to retain and distinguish the ideas the senses convey to it. And so we may observe how the mind, BY DEGREES, improves in these; and ADVANCES to the exercise of those other faculties of enlarging, compounding, and abstracting its ideas, and of reasoning about them, and reflecting upon all these; of which I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">从一个孩子出生开始，观察时间带来的变化，你会发现，随着感官带来的思想越来越多，它越来越清醒；思考得越多，它就越有东西可想。一段时间后，它开始认识那些它最熟悉的、给人留下深刻印象的物体。因此，它逐渐认识了每天与它交谈的人，并将他们与陌生人区分开来；这是它开始保留和区分感官传达给它的观念的实例和效果。因此，我们可以观察到，头脑是如何在这些方面逐级提高的；并推进到行使其他的能力，即扩大、复合和抽象其观念，以及对它们进行推理，并对所有这些进行反思；我将在下文中更多地谈到这些能力。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">If it shall be demanded then, WHEN a man BEGINS to have any ideas, I think the true answer is,—WHEN HE FIRST HAS ANY SENSATION. For, since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have conveyed any in, I conceive that ideas in the understanding are coeval with SENSATION; WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPRESSION OR MOTION MADE IN SOME PART OF THE BODY, AS MAKES IT BE TAKEN NOTICE OF IN THE UNDERSTANDING.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果有人问，一个人什么时候开始有任何想法，我认为真正的答案是：当他第一次有任何感觉的时候。因为，既然在感官传达任何观念之前，头脑中似乎没有任何观念，我认为，理解力中的观念与感觉是共存的；感觉是身体的某个部分产生的印象或运动，使它在理解力中被注意到了。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The impressions then that are made on our sense by outward objects that are extrinsical to the mind; and its own operations about these impressions, reflected on by itself, as proper objects to be contemplated by it, are, I conceive, the original of all knowledge. Thus the first capacity of human intellect is,—that the mind is fitted to receive the impressions made on it; either through the senses by outward objects, or by its own operations when it reflects on them. This is the first step a man makes towards the discovery of anything, and the groundwork whereon to build all those notions which ever he shall have naturally in this world. All those sublime thoughts which tower above the clouds, and reach as high as heaven itself, take their rise and footing here: in all that great extent wherein the mind wanders, in those remote speculations it may seem to be elevated with, it stirs not one jot beyond those ideas which SENSE or REFLECTION have offered for its contemplation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">那么，由外在物体给我们的感官造成的印象，以及它自己对这些印象的操作，由它自己反思，作为它要考虑的适当对象，我认为是所有知识的起源。因此，人类智力的第一种能力是：心灵适合于接受对它的印象；或者通过感官接受外在的物体，或者通过它自己对这些物体的反思操作。这是一个人发现任何事物的第一步，也是他在这个世界上自然产生的所有观念的基础。所有那些高耸入云、高达天堂的崇高思想，都是在这里产生和立足的：在心灵徘徊的所有大范围内，在那些看似高高在上的遥远猜测中，它没有一丝一毫超出理智或反思提供给它思考的那些想法。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">In this part the understanding is merely passive; and whether or no it will have these beginnings, and as it were materials of knowledge, is not in its own power. For the objects of our senses do, many of them, obtrude their particular ideas upon our minds whether we will or not; and the operations of our minds will not let us be without, at least, some obscure notions of them. No man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. These simple ideas, when offered to the mind, the understanding can no more refuse to have, nor alter when they are imprinted, nor blot them out and make new ones itself, than a mirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the images or ideas which the objects set before it do therein produce. As the bodies that surround us do diversely affect our organs, the mind is forced to receive the impressions; and cannot avoid the perception of those ideas that are annexed to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这一部分，理解力只是被动的；它是否会有这些开始，以及作为知识的材料，并不取决于它自己的能力。因为无论我们是否愿意，我们感官的对象确实，其中的许多对象，把它们的特殊观念强加在我们的头脑中；我们头脑的运作不会让我们没有，至少，对它们的一些模糊的概念。没有人可以完全不知道他在思考时做了什么。这些简单的想法，当被提供给头脑时，理解力不能拒绝拥有，也不能在它们被印上时加以改变，更不能把它们抹掉，自己制造新的想法，就像镜子不能拒绝、改变或抹去摆在它面前的物体在其中产生的图像或想法一样。由于我们周围的物体对我们的器官产生了不同的影响，心灵就不得不接受这些印象；而且无法避免对这些印象所附带的那些想法的感知。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Though the qualities that affect our senses are, in the things themselves, so united and blended, that there is no separation, no distance between them; yet it is plain, the ideas they produce in the mind enter by the senses simple; and unmixed. For, though the sight and touch often take in from the same object, at the same time, different ideas;—as a man sees at once motion and colour; the hand feels softness and warmth in the same piece of wax: yet the simple ideas thus united in the same subject, are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses. The coldness and hardness which a man feels in a piece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily; or as the taste of sugar, and smell of a rose. And there is nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he has of those simple ideas; which, being each in itself uncompounded, contains in it nothing but ONE UNIFORM APPEARANCE, OR CONCEPTION IN THE MIND, and is not distinguishable into different ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">尽管影响我们感官的品质在事物本身中是如此的统一和混合，以至于它们之间没有分离，没有距离；但很明显，它们在头脑中产生的想法是通过感官进入的，而且是不混合的。因为，尽管视觉和触觉经常同时从同一物体中吸收不同的观念；如一个人同时看到运动和颜色；手在同一块蜡中感觉到柔软和温暖：但这样在同一主体中结合的简单观念，与那些通过不同感官进入的观念一样完全不同。一个人在一块冰上感觉到的冷和硬，在头脑中就像百合花的气味和白色一样，或者像糖的味道和玫瑰花的气味一样，是不同的概念。对一个人来说，没有什么比他对这些简单的观念的清晰和明确的感知更清楚的了；这些观念本身是不复合的，其中只包含一个统一的外观，或在头脑中的概念，而不能被区分为不同的观念。</p>

</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">These simple ideas, the materials of all our knowledge, are suggested and furnished to the mind only by those two ways above mentioned, viz. sensation and reflection. When the understanding is once stored with these simple ideas, it has the power to repeat, compare, and unite them, even to an almost infinite variety, and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas. But it is not in the power of the most exalted wit, or enlarged understanding, by any quickness or variety of thought, to INVENT or FRAME one new simple idea in the mind, not taken in by the ways before mentioned: nor can any force of the understanding DESTROY those that are there. The dominion of man, in this little world of his own understanding being much what the same as it is in the great world of visible things; wherein his power, however managed by art and skill, reaches no farther than to compound and divide the materials that are made to his hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least particle of new matter, or destroying one atom of what is already in being. The same inability will every one find in himself, who shall go about to fashion in his understanding one simple idea, not received in by his senses from external objects, or by reflection from the operations of his own mind about them. I would have any one try to fancy any taste which had never affected his palate; or frame the idea of a scent he had never smelt: and when he can do this, I will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colours, and a deaf man true distinct notions of sounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这些简单的观念，也就是我们所有知识的材料，只有通过上述两种方式，即感觉和思考，才会被提示并提供给头脑。当理解力一旦储存了这些简单的观念，它就有能力重复、比较和统一这些观念，甚至达到几乎无穷无尽的程度，因此可以随心所欲地产生新的复杂观念。但是，最崇高的智慧或扩大的理解力，通过任何快速或多样的思维，都无法在头脑中发明或构建一个新的简单概念，而不是通过前面提到的方式来获取：理解力的任何力量也无法破坏那些存在的概念。人在自己的理解力这个小世界中的支配权与在可见事物的大世界中的支配权是一样的；在那里，他的能力，无论如何通过艺术和技巧来管理，也不过是对他手中的材料进行复合和分割；但对制造新物质的最小颗粒或破坏已经存在的东西的一个原子却无能为力。每个人都会发现自己有同样的无能，如果他想在自己的理解中形成一个简单的概念，而不是通过他的感官从外部物体接受，或通过他自己的头脑对它们的思考。我想让任何人尝试想象一下从未影响过他的味觉，或者构思一下他从未闻到过的气味：当他能做到这一点时，我也会得出结论，盲人对颜色有概念，聋人对声音有真正明确的概念。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This is the reason why—though we cannot believe it impossible to God to make a creature with other organs, and more ways to convey into the understanding the notice of corporeal things than those five, as they are usually counted, which he has given to man—yet I think it is not possible for any MAN to imagine any other qualities in bodies, howsoever constituted, whereby they can be taken notice of, besides sounds, tastes, smells, visible and tangible qualities. And had mankind been made but with four senses, the qualities then which are the objects of the fifth sense had been as far from our notice, imagination, and conception, as now any belonging to a sixth, seventh, or eighth sense can possibly be;—which, whether yet some other creatures, in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe, may not have, will be a great presumption to deny. He that will not set himself proudly at the top of all things, but will consider the immensity of this fabric, and the great variety that is to be found in this little and inconsiderable part of it which he has to do with, may be apt to think that, in other mansions of it, there may be other and different intelligent beings, of whose faculties he has as little knowledge or apprehension as a worm shut up in one drawer of a cabinet hath of the senses or understanding of a man; such variety and excellency being suitable to the wisdom and power of the Maker. I have here followed the common opinion of man’s having but five senses; though, perhaps, there may be justly counted more;—but either supposition serves equally to my present purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这就是为什么--虽然我们不能相信上帝不可能制造一个具有其他器官的生物，以及除了他给人的那五种通常被计算的器官之外，还有更多的方法来传达对有形事物的注意--但我认为，除了声音、味道、气味、可见和有形的品质之外，任何一个人都不可能想象身体中还有任何其他品质，可以让人注意到它们。如果人类只有四种感官，那么作为第五种感官对象的品质就会像现在属于第六、第七或第八种感官的任何品质一样，远离我们的注意、想象和概念；--无论在这个广阔而巨大的宇宙中的某些其他地方，是否有其他生物可能没有这些品质，否认这一点都是一种极大的推测。他不会骄傲地把自己置于万物之首，而是考虑到这一结构的广袤，以及在他必须处理的这一小部分中所发现的巨大差异，可能会认为，在它的其他地方，可能有其他不同的智能生物，他对这些生物的能力所知甚少，就像关在柜子的一个抽屉里的虫子对一个人的感官或理解力的了解一样。这种多样性和卓越性适合于造物主的智慧和能力。我在这里遵循了人类只有五种感官的普遍观点；尽管也许可以合理地计算出更多的感官；但这两种假设对我目前的目的同样适用。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">There are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense, which is peculiarly adapted to receive them. Thus light and colours, as white, red, yellow, blue; with their several degrees or shades and mixtures, as green, scarlet, purple, sea-green, and the rest, come in only by the eyes. All kinds of noises, sounds, and tones, only by the ears. The several tastes and smells, by the nose and palate. And if these organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brain,—the mind’s presence-room (as I may so call it)—are any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">有些观念只能通过一种感官来接受，而这种感官又特别适合于接受它们。因此，光和颜色，如白色、红色、黄色、蓝色；以及它们的几个程度或色调和混合物，如绿色、猩红色、紫色、海绿色和其他颜色，只能通过眼睛进入。各种噪音、声音和音调，只通过耳朵。几种味道和气味，只能通过鼻子和上颚。如果这些器官，或者作为管道将它们从外部输送到它们在大脑中的听众--心灵的存在室（我可以这样称呼它）--其中任何一个器官紊乱到无法发挥它们的功能，它们就没有后门可以进入；没有其他方法使它们进入视野，并被理解力所感知。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The most considerable of those belonging to the touch, are heat and cold, and solidity: all the rest, consisting almost wholly in the sensible configuration, as smooth and rough; or else, more or less firm adhesion of the parts, as hard and soft, tough and brittle, are obvious enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在属于触觉的那些东西中，最重要的是热和冷，以及牢固性：所有其余的，几乎完全由可感的构造组成，如光滑和粗糙；或者，或多或少的部件的牢固粘附，如硬和软，坚韧和脆性，都足够明显。</p>

<div class="bottom">

		<p class="calibre5 en">I think it will be needless to enumerate all the particular simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would; there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for. The variety of smells, which are as many almost, if not more, than species of bodies in the world, do most of them want names. Sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these ideas, which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing; though the smell of a rose and violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct ideas. Nor are the different tastes, that by our palates we receive ideas of, much better provided with names. Sweet, bitter, sour, harsh, and salt are almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of creatures, but in the different parts of the same plant, fruit, or animal. The same may be said of colours and sounds. I shall, therefore, in the account of simple ideas I am here giving, content myself to set down only such as are most material to our present purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas; amongst which, I think, I may well account solidity, which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为没有必要列举属于每个感官的所有特定的简单概念。即使我们想列举也不可能；属于大多数感官的概念比我们的名字多得多。各种各样的气味，如果不是更多的话，几乎和世界上的身体种类一样多，它们中的大多数都需要名字。甜味和臭味通常是我们对这些概念的反应，实际上这只不过是把它们称为令人愉快或不愉快；尽管玫瑰和紫罗兰的气味都是甜的，但肯定是非常独特的概念。不同的味道，通过我们的味觉，我们得到了不同的概念，也有了更好的名称。甜、苦、酸、涩、咸，几乎是我们对无数种味道的全部称谓，这些味道不仅在几乎每一种生物中，而且在同一种植物、水果或动物的不同部位，都能找到不同的味道。颜色和声音的情况也是如此。因此，在我这里对简单概念的描述中，我将满足于只列出对我们目前的目的最重要的那些概念，或者说，虽然它们经常是我们复杂概念的成分，但它们本身不太容易被注意到；我认为，在这些概念中，我可以把实体性算进去，因此我将在下一章中讨论。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The idea of SOLIDITY we receive by our touch: and it arises from the resistance which we find in body to the entrance of any other body into the place it possesses, till it has left it. There is no idea which we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether we move or rest, in what posture soever we are, we always feel something under us that supports us, and hinders our further sinking downwards; and the bodies which we daily handle make us perceive that, whilst they remain between them, they do, by an insurmountable force, hinder the approach of the parts of our hands that press them. THAT WHICH THUS HINDERS THE APPROACH OF TWO BODIES, WHEN THEY ARE MOVED ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER, I CALL SOLIDITY. I will not dispute whether this acceptation of the word solid be nearer to its original signification than that which mathematicians use it in. It suffices that I think the common notion of solidity will allow, if not justify, this use of it; but if any one think it better to call it IMPENETRABILITY, he has my consent. Only I have thought the term solidity the more proper to express this idea, not only because of its vulgar use in that sense, but also because it carries something more of positive in it than impenetrability; which is negative, and is perhaps more a consequence of solidity, than solidity itself. This, of all other, seems the idea most intimately connected with, and essential to body; so as nowhere else to be found or imagined, but only in matter. And though our senses take no notice of it, but in masses of matter, of a bulk sufficient to cause a sensation in us: yet the mind, having once got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies, traces it further, and considers it, as well as figure, in the minutest particle of matter that can exist; and finds it inseparably inherent in body, wherever or however modified.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们通过触觉获得了 "固体 "的概念：它产生于我们发现身体对任何其他身体进入它所拥有的地方的阻力，直到它离开它。我们从感觉中得到的最经常的观念莫过于稳固性。无论我们是运动还是休息，无论我们是什么姿势，我们总是感觉到在我们下面有什么东西支撑着我们，并阻止我们进一步向下沉沦；我们每天处理的身体使我们认识到，虽然它们保持在它们之间，但它们确实以一种不可逾越的力量，阻碍了我们的手压迫它们的部分的接近。因此，当两个物体被移向另一个时，阻碍它们接近的东西，我称之为稳固性。我不想争论这个词的这种接受方式是否比数学家使用它的方式更接近它的原始含义。我认为固体的普通概念即使不能证明它的使用是合理的，也会允许；但如果有人认为把它称为 "弹性 "会更好，我也同意。只是我认为用 "坚固性 "这个词来表达这个概念更合适，不仅是因为它在这个意义上的通俗使用，而且还因为它比 "不可渗透性 "含有更多的积极因素；"不可渗透性 "是消极的，也许比坚固性本身更像是坚固性的一个结果。在所有其他概念中，这似乎是与身体最密切相关、最基本的概念；因此，除了在物质中，没有其他地方可以找到或想象到。尽管我们的感官没有注意到它，但在物质的块状物中，其体积足以引起我们的感觉：然而，头脑一旦从这种较粗的可感体中得到这种观念，就会进一步追踪它，并在可能存在的最微小的物质颗粒中考虑它，以及考虑它的形状；并发现它不可分割地存在于身体中，无论在哪里或如何修改。</p>

The idea of which filling of space is,—that where we imagine any space taken up by a solid substance, we conceive it so to possess it, that it excludes all other solid substances; and will for ever hinder any other two bodies, that move towards one another in a straight line, from coming to touch one another, unless it removes from between them in a line not parallel to that which they move in.

		<p class="calibre5 en">This resistance, whereby it keeps other bodies out of the space which it possesses, is so great, that no force, how great soever, can surmount it. All the bodies in the world, pressing a drop of water on all sides, will never be able to overcome the resistance which it will make, soft as it is, to their approaching one another, till it be removed out of their way: whereby our idea of solidity is distinguished both from pure space, which is capable neither of resistance nor motion; and from the ordinary idea of hardness. For a man may conceive two bodies at a distance, so as they may approach one another, without touching or displacing any solid thing, till their superficies come to meet; whereby, I think, we have the clear idea of space without solidity. For (not to go so far as annihilation of any particular body) I ask, whether a man cannot have the idea of the motion of one single body alone, without any other succeeding immediately into its place? I think it is evident he can: the idea of motion in one body no more including the idea of motion in another, than the idea of a square figure in one body includes the idea of a square figure in another. I do not ask, whether bodies do so EXIST, that the motion of one body cannot really be without the motion of another. To determine this either way, is to beg the question for or against a VACUUM. But my question is,—whether one cannot have the IDEA of one body moved, whilst others are at rest? And I think this no one will deny. If so, then the place it deserted gives us the idea of pure space without solidity; whereinto any other body may enter, without either resistance or protrusion of anything. When the sucker in a pump is drawn, the space it filled in the tube is certainly the same whether any other body follows the motion of the sucker or not: nor does it imply a contradiction that, upon the motion of one body, another that is only contiguous to it should not follow it. The necessity of such a motion is built only on the supposition that the world is full; but not on the distinct IDEAS of space and solidity, which are as different as resistance and not resistance, protrusion and not protrusion. And that men have ideas of space without a body, their very disputes about a vacuum plainly demonstrate, as is shown in another place.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这种阻力使其他物体无法进入它所拥有的空间，这种阻力是如此之大，以至于任何力量，无论多么强大，都无法逾越它。世界上所有的物体，把一滴水压在四面八方，都无法克服它对它们相互接近的阻力，因为它是软的，除非把它移开。因为人们可以设想，两个物体在一定距离内，可以相互接近，而不接触或移开任何固体，直到它们的表面相接；我认为，这样，我们就有了没有固体的空间的明确概念。因为（不要说到任何特定体的湮灭）我问，一个人是否不能单独拥有一个单一体的运动的概念，而没有任何其他体紧接着进入其位置？我认为很明显，他可以：一个身体的运动观念并不包括另一个身体的运动观念，就像一个身体中的方形图形的观念包括另一个身体中的方形图形的观念。我不问，身体是否如此存在，以至于一个身体的运动不可能真的没有另一个的运动。确定这一点的任何一种方式，都是在讨好支持或反对真空的问题。但我的问题是，一个人是否不能有一个身体运动而其他身体静止的想法？我想这是没有人会否认的。如果是这样，那么它所遗弃的地方就给了我们一个没有实体的纯粹空间的概念；任何其他物体都可以进入其中，而没有任何阻力或突起。当泵中的吸盘被抽出时，无论是否有其他物体跟随吸盘的运动，它在管中填充的空间肯定是一样的：这也不意味着在一个物体的运动中，另一个仅与之相邻的物体不应跟随它，这是一种矛盾。这种运动的必要性只是建立在世界是完整的假设上；而不是建立在空间和实体的不同概念上，它们就像阻力和非阻力、突起和非突起一样不同。正如在另一个地方所显示的那样，人们有关于没有身体的空间的想法，他们关于真空的争论清楚地证明了这一点。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Solidity is hereby also differenced from hardness, in that solidity consists in repletion, and so an utter exclusion of other bodies out of the space it possesses: but hardness, in a firm cohesion of the parts of matter, making up masses of a sensible bulk, so that the whole does not easily change its figure. And indeed, hard and soft are names that we give to things only in relation to the constitutions of our own bodies; that being generally called hard by us, which will put us to pain sooner than change figure by the pressure of any part of our bodies; and that, on the contrary, soft, which changes the situation of its parts upon an easy and unpainful touch.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">固体与坚硬也有区别，因为固体是由填充物组成的，因此完全将其他物体排除在它所拥有的空间之外：而坚硬则是由物质的各个部分牢固地凝聚在一起，组成具有明显体积的块状物，因此整体不容易改变其形状。事实上，硬和软是我们对事物的称呼，只是与我们自己身体的构造有关；我们通常称其为硬，因为我们身体的任何部分受压都会使我们痛苦，而不是改变形状；相反，软则是在轻松和不痛苦的触摸下改变其部分的情况。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">But this difficulty of changing the situation of the sensible parts amongst themselves, or of the figure of the whole, gives no more solidity to the hardest body in the world than to the softest; nor is an adamant one jot more solid than water. For, though the two flat sides of two pieces of marble will more easily approach each other, between which there is nothing but water or air, than if there be a diamond between them; yet it is not that the parts of the diamond are more solid than those of water, or resist more; but because the parts of water, being more easily separable from each other, they will, by a side motion, be more easily removed, and give way to the approach of the two pieces of marble. But if they could be kept from making place by that side motion, they would eternally hinder the approach of these two pieces of marble, as much as the diamond; and it would be as impossible by any force to surmount their resistance, as to surmount the resistance of the parts of a diamond. The softest body in the world will as invincibly resist the coming together of any other two bodies, if it be not put out of the way, but remain between them, as the hardest that can be found or imagined. He that shall fill a yielding soft body well with air or water, will quickly find its resistance. And he that thinks that nothing but bodies that are hard can keep his hands from approaching one another, may be pleased to make a trial, with the air inclosed in a football. The experiment, I have been told, was made at Florence, with a hollow globe of gold filled with water, and exactly closed; which further shows the solidity of so soft a body as water. For the golden globe thus filled, being put into a press, which was driven by the extreme force of screws, the water made itself way through the pores of that very close metal, and finding no room for a nearer approach of its particles within, got to the outside, where it rose like a dew, and so fell in drops, before the sides of the globe could be made to yield to the violent compression of the engine that squeezed it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，这种改变可感部分之间的情况或整体形状的困难，并没有给世界上最硬的身体带来比最软的身体更多的坚固性；金刚砂也没有比水更坚固。因为，尽管两块大理石的两个平面更容易相互接近，而它们之间只有水或空气，比它们之间有一块钻石更容易接近；但这并不是说钻石的部分比水的部分更坚固，或更有抵抗力；而是因为水的部分更容易相互分离，它们通过一个侧面运动，更容易被移除，并为两块大理石的接近让路。但是，如果它们可以通过这种侧面运动来阻止它们的位置，它们就会像钻石一样永远阻碍这两块大理石的接近；而且用任何力量都不可能克服它们的阻力，就像克服钻石各部分的阻力一样。世界上最柔软的身体，如果不把它放在外面，而是留在它们之间，就会像能找到或想象到的最硬的东西一样，不可战胜地抵制任何其他两个身体的结合。在一个柔软的身体里注入空气或水的人，会很快发现它的阻力。如果有人认为，除了坚硬的物体外，没有任何东西能使他的手不接近对方，那么他可能会乐意做一个试验，把空气包在一个足球里。我被告知，这个实验是在佛罗伦萨进行的，用一个空心的金球装满了水，并且完全封闭；这进一步说明了水这样柔软的物体的坚固性。因为这样装满水的金球被放进一个由螺丝钉极力驱动的压力机里，水穿过非常紧密的金属孔隙，发现里面的颗粒没有靠近的空间，就跑到了外面，在那里像露水一样上升，然后一滴滴地落下，然后金球的侧面就会被挤压的发动机的剧烈压缩所折服。</p>

Upon the solidity of bodies also depend their mutual impulse, resistance, and protrusion. Of pure space then, and solidity, there are several (amongst which I confess myself one) who persuade themselves they have clear and distinct ideas; and that they can think on space, without anything in it that resists or is protruded by body. This is the idea of pure space, which they think they have as clear as any idea they can have of the extension of body: the idea of the distance between the opposite parts of a concave superficies being equally as clear without as with the idea of any solid parts between: and on the other side, they persuade themselves that they have, distinct from that of pure space, the idea of SOMETHING THAT FILLS SPACE, that can be protruded by the impulse of other bodies, or resist their motion. If there be others that have not these two ideas distinct, but confound them, and make but one of them, I know not how men, who have the same idea under different names, or different ideas under the same name, can in that case talk with one another; any more than a man who, not being blind or deaf, has distinct ideas of the colour of scarlet and the sound of a trumpet, could discourse concerning scarlet colour with the blind man I mentioned in another place, who fancied that the idea of scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">身体的延伸和空间的延伸是通过这种实体性的概念来区分的：身体的延伸只不过是固体的、可分离的、可移动的部分的凝聚力或连续性；而空间的延伸则是不固体的、不可分离的和不可移动的部分的连续性。身体的稳固性也取决于它们的相互冲力、阻力和突起。那么，对于纯粹的空间和实体性，有几个人（我承认我是其中之一）说服自己，他们有清晰而明确的想法；他们可以思考空间，其中没有任何抵抗或被身体突出的东西。这就是纯空间的观念，他们认为他们拥有的纯空间的观念与他们对身体的延伸的任何观念一样清楚：凹面的相对部分之间的距离的观念，在没有任何固体部分的情况下也同样清楚：在另一方面，他们说服自己，他们有不同于纯空间的观念，有某种填充空间的观念，它可以被其他身体的冲力突出，或抵制它们的运动。如果还有人没有这两种不同的观念，而是把它们混为一谈，我不知道在不同名称下有相同观念的人，或者在相同名称下有不同观念的人，在这种情况下如何能够相互交谈；就像一个不是瞎子或聋子的人，对大红的颜色和喇叭的声音有不同的观念，可以与我在另一个地方提到的盲人讨论大红的颜色，他认为大红的观念就像喇叭的声音。</p>

The simple ideas we have, are such as experience teaches them us; but if, beyond that, we endeavour by words to make them clearer in the mind, we shall succeed no better than if we went about to clear up the darkness of a blind man’s mind by talking; and to discourse into him the ideas of light and colours.

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们存在的无限智慧的创造者，给了我们对我们身体几个部分的权力，使它们按我们认为合适的方式运动或保持静止；并且，通过它们的运动，使我们自己和其他相邻的身体运动，我们身体的所有行为都在其中。他还赋予我们的头脑一种能力，在若干情况下，在它的观念中选择它要思考的问题，并以考虑和注意的方式探究这个或那个问题，以激发我们的这些思考和运动的行动，我们能够做到的，他高兴地把若干思想和若干感觉与快乐的感觉联系起来。如果这与我们所有的外在感觉和内在思想完全分离，我们就没有理由选择一种思想或行动而不是另一种；选择疏忽而不是关注，选择运动而不是休息。因此，我们既不应该搅动我们的身体，也不应该运用我们的思想，而应该让我们的思想（如果我可以这样说的话）漂流，没有任何方向或设计，让我们头脑中的想法，像没有人注意的影子一样，在那里露面，而不去注意它们。在这种状态下，无论人的理解力和意志力如何，都会是一个非常闲散、不活跃的生物，只能在懒散、昏昏欲睡的梦中打发时间。因此，我们聪明的造物主高兴地将一些物体和我们从这些物体中得到的想法，以及我们的一些想法，附在一些物体上，附在一些程度上，使他赋予我们的这些能力不至于完全闲置，不被我们所利用。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Pain has the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure has, we being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that, as to pursue this: only this is worth our consideration, that pain is often produced by the same objects and ideas that produce pleasure in us. This their near conjunction, which makes us often feel pain in the sensations where we expected pleasure, gives us new occasion of admiring the wisdom and goodness of our Maker, who, designing the preservation of our being, has annexed pain to the application of many things to our bodies, to warn us of the harm that they will do, and as advices to withdraw from them. But he, not designing our preservation barely, but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection, hath in many cases annexed pain to those very ideas which delight us. Thus heat, that is very agreeable to us in one degree, by a little greater increase of it proves no ordinary torment: and the most pleasant of all sensible objects, light itself, if there be too much of it, if increased beyond a due proportion to our eyes, causes a very painful sensation. Which is wisely and favourably so ordered by nature, that when any object does, by the vehemency of its operation, disorder the instruments of sensation, whose structures cannot but be very nice and delicate, we might, by the pain, be warned to withdraw, before the organ be quite put out of order, and so be unfitted for its proper function for the future. The consideration of those objects that produce it may well persuade us, that this is the end or use of pain. For, though great light be insufferable to our eyes, yet the highest degree of darkness does not at all disease them: because that, causing no disorderly motion in it, leaves that curious organ unarmed in its natural state. But yet excess of cold as well as heat pains us: because it is equally destructive to that temper which is necessary to the preservation of life, and the exercise of the several functions of the body, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth; or, if you please, a motion of the insensible parts of our bodies, confined within certain bounds.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">痛苦具有与快乐相同的效力和作用，使我们开始工作，我们愿意运用我们的能力来避免这种情况，就像追求这种情况一样：只有这一点值得我们考虑，即痛苦往往是由在我们身上产生快乐的相同物体和想法产生的。它们的这种紧密结合，使我们经常在我们期待的快乐的感觉中感到痛苦，这给我们提供了新的机会，使我们钦佩我们造物主的智慧和仁慈，他为了保护我们的存在，在对我们的身体使用许多东西时，都附加了痛苦，以警告我们它们会造成的伤害，并作为劝告我们退出它们。但是，他不是仅仅为了保护我们，而是为了保护每个部分和器官的完美，在许多情况下，他把痛苦附在那些使我们高兴的想法上。因此，在某种程度上对我们非常有利的热，只要稍微增加一点，就证明不是普通的痛苦：所有感官物体中最令人愉快的光本身，如果有太多的光，如果超过我们眼睛的适当比例，就会引起非常痛苦的感觉。这是自然界明智而有利的安排，当任何物体因其运作的激烈性而扰乱感觉工具时，而感觉工具的结构不能不说是非常好的和精致的，我们可以通过疼痛来警告我们，在器官完全失去秩序之前撤回，并因此不适合在未来发挥其适当的功能。对那些产生疼痛的物体的考虑可以很好地说服我们，这就是疼痛的目的或用途。因为，尽管巨大的光亮让我们的眼睛难以忍受，但最高程度的黑暗也不会使它们生病：因为黑暗不会使眼睛产生无序的运动，使这个好奇的器官在其自然状态下没有武器。但是，过冷和过热都会使我们感到痛苦：因为它同样会破坏维持生命和行使身体各种功能所必需的气质，而这种气质包括适度的温暖；或者，如果你愿意的话，我们身体的无知觉部分的运动被限制在一定范围内。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Concerning the simple ideas of Sensation; it is to be considered,—that whatsoever is so constituted in nature as to be able, by affecting our senses, to cause any perception in the mind, doth thereby produce in the understanding a simple idea; which, whatever be the external cause of it, when it comes to be taken notice of by our discerning faculty, it is by the mind looked on and considered there to be a real positive idea in the understanding, as much as any other whatsoever; though, perhaps, the cause of it be but a privation of the subject.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">关于感觉的简单概念；应该考虑到，凡是在自然界中构成的，能够通过影响我们的感官，在头脑中引起任何感知的东西，都会因此在理解中产生一个简单的概念。不管它的外部原因是什么，当它被我们的辨别能力注意到时，它就会被心灵看成是理解力中的一个真正的积极想法，就像其他任何东西一样；尽管，也许它的原因只是主体的缺失。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus the ideas of heat and cold, light and darkness, white and black, motion and rest, are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind; though, perhaps, some of the causes which produce them are barely privations, in those subjects from whence our senses derive those ideas. These the understanding, in its view of them, considers all as distinct positive ideas, without taking notice of the causes that produce them: which is an inquiry not belonging to the idea, as it is in the understanding, but to the nature of the things existing without us. These are two very different things, and carefully to be distinguished; it being one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black, and quite another to examine what kind of particles they must be, and how ranged in the superficies, to make any object appear white or black.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，冷与热、光与暗、白与黑、运动与静止的观念，在头脑中同样是清晰而积极的观念；尽管在我们的感官产生这些观念的那些主题中，产生这些观念的一些原因是勉强的缺点。理解力在看待它们的时候，把它们都看作是独特的积极观念，而没有注意到产生它们的原因：这是一种不属于观念的探究，因为它在理解力中是这样的，而是属于我们以外的事物的性质。这是两件截然不同的事情，要仔细加以区分；感知和了解白色或黑色的概念是一回事，而研究它们必须是什么样的颗粒，以及在表面的分布情况，以使任何物体呈现白色或黑色是另一回事。</p>

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">一个从未探究过它们的原因的画家或染匠，在他的理解中对白色和黑色以及其他颜色的观念是一样清楚、完美和明确的，也许比忙于考虑它们的性质的哲学家更清楚，并认为他知道它们中的任何一种在其原因上是积极的还是消极的；黑色的观念在他心中的积极性并不比白色的低，不管这种颜色在外部物体中的原因可能只是一种消极的。</p>

</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">If it were the design of my present undertaking to inquire into the natural causes and manner of perception, I should offer this as a reason why a privative cause might, in some cases at least, produce a positive idea; viz. that all sensation being produced in us only by different degrees and modes of motion in our animal spirits, variously agitated by external objects, the abatement of any former motion must as necessarily produce a new sensation as the variation or increase of it; and so introduce a new idea, which depends only on a different motion of the animal spirits in that organ.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果我现在的任务是探究感知的自然原因和方式，那么我应该提出这样一个理由，即至少在某些情况下，一个私人原因可能会产生一个积极的想法；也就是说，所有的感觉都是由我们的动物精神的不同程度和模式的运动产生的，受到外部物体的不同刺激，任何以前的运动的减少必须像它的变化或增加一样必然产生一个新的感觉；因此引入一个新的想法，这只取决于动物精神在该器官的不同运动。</p>

And the picture of a shadow is a positive thing. Indeed, we have negative names, to which there be no positive ideas; but they consist wholly in negation of some certain ideas, as SILENCE, INVISIBLE; but these signify not any ideas in the mind but their absence.</p>

<div class="top right">

		<p class="calibre5 en">Concerning these qualities, we, I think, observe these primary ones in bodies that produce simple ideas in us, viz. SOLIDITY, EXTENSION, MOTION or REST, NUMBER or FIGURE. These, which I call ORIGINAL or PRIMARY qualities of body, are wholly inseperable from it; and such as in all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be used upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less than to make itself singly be perceived by our senses: v.g. Take a grain of wheat, divide it into two parts; each part has still solidity, extension, figure, and mobility: divide it again, and it retains still the same qualities; and so divide it on, till the parts become insensible; they must retain still each of them all those qualities. For division (which is all that a mill, or pestle, or any other body, does upon another, in reducing it to insensible parts) can never take away either solidity, extension, figure, or mobility from any body, but only makes two or more distinct separate masses of matter, of that which was but one before; all which distinct masses, reckoned as so many distinct bodies, after division, make a certain number.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">关于这些品质，我认为，我们在身体中观察到这些主要的品质，这些品质在我们心中产生了简单的概念，即稳固性、伸展性、运动或静止、数字或图形。这些，我称之为身体的原始或首要的品质，是完全不可分割的；在它所遭受的所有改变和变化中，在它身上可以使用的所有力量中，它始终保持着这些品质；在每一个有足够体积的物质颗粒中，感官始终发现这些品质；心灵发现与每一个物质颗粒不可分割，尽管还不足以使自己单独被我们的感官所感知：V。g. 以一粒麦子为例，把它分成两部分；每一部分仍有坚固性、延伸性、形状和流动性：再分一次，它仍保持同样的品质；这样继续分下去，直到各部分变得不可感知；它们必须仍各自保持所有这些品质。因为分割（也就是磨子、杵子或任何其他物体在另一个物体上所做的一切，把它变成不可知的部分）永远不会从任何物体上拿走实体性、延伸性、形状或流动性，而只是把以前只是一个物体变成两个或更多不同的独立物质块；所有这些不同的物质块，在分割后被算作许多不同的物体，构成一定数量。</p>

And since the extension, figure, number, and motion of bodies of an observable bigness, maybe perceived at a distance by the sight, it is evident some singly imperceptible bodies must come from them; to the eyes, and thereby convey to the brain some motion; which produces these ideas which we have of them in us.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">After the same manner that the ideas of these original qualities are produced in us, we may conceive that the ideas of SECONDARY qualities are also produced, viz. by the operation of insensible particles on our senses. For, it being manifest that there are bodies and good store of bodies, each whereof are so small, that we cannot by any of our senses discover either their bulk, figure, or motion,—as is evident in the particles of the air and water, and others extremely smaller than those; perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air and water, as the particles of air and water are smaller than peas or hail-stones;—let us suppose at present that, the different motions and figures, bulk and number, of such particles, affecting the several organs of our senses, produce: in us those different sensations which we have from the colours and smells of bodies; v.g. that a violet, by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter, of peculiar figures and bulks, and in different degrees and modifications of their motions, causes the ideas of the blue colour, and sweet scent of that flower to be produced in our minds. It being no more impossible to conceive that God should annex such ideas to such motions, with which they have no similitude, than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our flesh, with which that idea hath no resemblance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">按照这些原始品质的观念在我们身上产生的同样方式，我们可以设想，次要品质的观念也会产生，即通过对我们的感官进行不可知的微粒操作。因为，很明显，有些物体和大量的物体，每一个都非常小，以至于我们的任何感官都无法发现它们的体积、形状或运动，这一点在空气和水的颗粒中很明显，还有一些比它们更小的颗粒；也许比空气和水的颗粒小得多，就像空气和水的颗粒比豌豆或冰雹小一样；我们现在假设，这些颗粒的不同运动和形状、体积和数量，影响我们感官的几个器官，产生。在我们身上产生了不同的感觉，这些感觉是我们从身体的颜色和气味中得到的；例如紫色，通过这种不可知的物质粒子的冲动，其特殊的数字和体积，以及其运动的不同程度和变化，使我们的头脑中产生蓝色的想法，以及该花的甜美气味。我们不可能想象，上帝会把这些想法附在这些运动上，而这些运动与之并不相似，就像他会把痛苦的想法附在一块分割我们肉体的钢铁运动上，而这个想法与之并不相像一样。</p>

There is nothing like our ideas, existing in the bodies themselves. They are, in the bodies we denominate from them, only a power to produce those sensations in us: and what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of the insensible parts, in the bodies themselves, which we call so.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">从这里，我认为很容易得出这样的结论--身体的初级品质的观念是它们的相似性，它们的模式确实存在于身体本身，但由这些次级品质在我们身上产生的观念与它们完全没有相似性。没有任何东西像我们的观念，存在于身体本身。在我们所称的身体中，它们只是在我们身上产生这些感觉的一种力量：而在观念中的甜美、蓝色或温暖，不过是身体本身中不可感觉的部分的一定的体积、形状和运动，我们称之为这样。</p>

Which qualities are commonly thought to be the same in those bodies that those ideas are in us, the one the perfect resemblance of the other, as they are in a mirror, and it would by most men be judged very extravagant if one should say otherwise. And yet he that will consider that the same fire that, at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth, does, at a nearer approach, produce in us the far different sensation of pain, ought to bethink himself what reason he has to say—that this idea of warmth, which was produced in him by the fire, is ACTUALLY IN THE FIRE; and his idea of pain, which the same fire produced in him the same way, is NOT in the fire.

This idea of motion represents it as it really is in manna moving: a circle or square are the same, whether in idea or existence, in the mind or in the manna. And this, both motion and as figure, are really in the manna, whether we take notice of primary, them or no: this everybody is ready to agree to. Besides, manna, by the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of its parts, has a power to produce the sensations of sickness, and sometimes of acute pains or gripings in us. That these ideas of sickness and pain are NOT in the manna, but effects of its operations on us, and are nowhere when we feel them not; this also every one readily agrees to. And yet men are hardly to be brought to think that sweetness and whiteness are not really in manna; which are but the effects of the operations of manna, by the motion, size, and figure of its particles, on the eyes and palate: as the pain and sickness caused by manna are confessedly nothing but the effects of its operations on the stomach and guts, by the size, motion, and figure of its insensible parts, (for by nothing else can a body operate, as has been proved): as if it could not operate on the eyes and palate, and thereby produce in the mind particular distinct ideas, which in itself it has not, as well as we allow it can operate on the guts and stomach, and thereby produce distinct ideas, which in itself it has not. These ideas, being all effects of the operations of manna on several parts of our bodies, by the size, figure, number, and motion of its parts;—why those produced by the eyes and palate should rather be thought to be really in the manna, than those produced by the stomach and guts; or why the pain and sickness, ideas that are the effect of manna, should be thought to be nowhere when they are not felt; and yet the sweetness and whiteness, effects of the same manna on other parts of the body, by ways equally as unknown, should be thought to exist in the manna, when they are not seen or tasted, would need some reason to explain.</p>

For, if we imagine WARMTH, as it is in our hands, to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particles of our nerves or animal spirits, we may understand how it is possible that the same water may, at the same time, produce the sensations of heat in one hand and cold in the other; which yet FIGURE never does, that never producing the idea of a square by one hand which has produced the idea of a globe by another. But if the sensation of heat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies, caused by the corpuscles of any other body, it is easy to be understood, that if that motion be greater in one hand than in the other; if a body be applied to the two hands, which has in its minute particles a greater motion than in those of one of the hands, and a less than in those of the other, it will increase the motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other; and so cause the different sensations of heat and cold that depend thereon.</p>

The idea of heat or light, which we receive by our eyes, or touch, from the sun, are commonly thought real qualities existing in the sun, and something more than mere powers in it. But when we consider the sun in reference to wax, which it melts or blanches, we look on the whiteness and softness produced in the wax, not as qualities in the sun, but effects produced by powers in it. Whereas, if rightly considered, these qualities of light and warmth, which are perceptions in me when I am warmed or enlightened by the sun, are no otherwise in the sun, than the changes made in the wax, when it is blanched or melted, are in the sun. They are all of them equally POWERS IN THE SUN, DEPENDING ON ITS PRIMARY QUALITIES; whereby it is able, in the one case, so to alter the bulk, figure, texture, or motion of some of the insensible parts of my eyes or hands, as thereby to produce in me the idea of light or heat; and in the other, it is able so to alter the bulk, figure, texture, or motion of the insensible parts of the wax, as to make them fit to produce in me the distinct ideas of white and fluid.</p>

</div>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The reason why the one are ordinarily taken for real qualities, and the other only for bare powers, seems to be because the ideas we have of distinct colours, sounds, &amp;c. containing nothing at all in them of bulk, figure, or motion we are not apt to think them the effects of these primary qualities; which appear not, to our senses, to operate in their production, and with which they have not any apparent congruity or conceivable connexion. Hence it is that we are so forward as to imagine, that those ideas are the resemblances of something really existing in the objects themselves since sensation discovers nothing of bulk, figure, or motion of parts in their production; nor can reason show how bodies BY THEIR BULK, FIGURE, AND MOTION, should produce in the mind the ideas of blue or yellow, &amp;c. But, in the other case in the operations of bodies changing the qualities one of another, we plainly discover that the quality produced hath commonly no resemblance with anything in the thing producing it; wherefore we look on it as a bare effect of power. For, through receiving the idea of heat or light from the sun, we are apt to think IT is a perception and resemblance of such a quality in the sun; yet when we see wax, or a fair face, receive change of colour from the sun, we cannot imagine THAT to be the reception or resemblance of anything in the sun, because we find not those different colours in the sun itself. For, our senses being able to observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two different external objects, we forwardly enough conclude the production of any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of bare power, and not the communication of any quality which was really in the efficient, when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that produced it. But our senses, not being able to discover any unlikeness between the idea produced in us, and the quality of the object producing it, we are apt to imagine that our ideas are resemblances of something in the objects, and not the effects of certain powers placed in the modification of their primary qualities, with which primary qualities the ideas produced in us have no resemblance.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">之所以通常把前者当作真正的品质，而把后者当作赤裸裸的力量，似乎是因为我们对独特的颜色、声音等所产生的观念，根本不包含任何体积、形状或运动，我们不可能认为它们是这些主要品质的效果；在我们的感官看来，这些品质在它们的产生中没有任何作用，而且与它们也没有任何明显的一致性或可想象的联系。因此，我们才会如此前卫地想象，这些观念是物体本身真正存在的东西的相似性，因为在它们的产生过程中，感官没有发现任何物体的体积、形状或运动；理性也无法说明，物体通过它们的体积、形状和运动，如何在头脑中产生蓝色或黄色等观念。但是，在另一种情况下，在身体改变另一个人的品质的操作中，我们清楚地发现，所产生的品质通常与产生它的东西没有任何相似之处；因此，我们把它看成是力量的纯粹效果。因为，通过接受来自太阳的热或光的概念，我们很容易认为这是太阳中这种品质的感知和相似性；然而，当我们看到蜡或一张白皙的脸从太阳中接受颜色的变化时，我们不能想象这是太阳中任何东西的接受或相似性，因为我们在太阳本身中没有发现这些不同颜色。因为，我们的感官能够在两个不同的外部物体中观察到感性品质的相似或不相似，当我们在产生感性品质的事物中没有发现这样的感性品质时，我们就会很迅速地得出结论，认为在任何主体中产生的任何感性品质都是赤裸裸的力量的作用，而不是真正在有效中的任何品质的传达。但是，我们的感官无法发现在我们身上产生的观念与产生它的物体的质量之间有任何不相似之处，我们很容易想象，我们的观念是物体中某些东西的相似性，而不是某些权力的效果，这些权力被置于对它们的主要质量的修改中，而在我们身上产生的观念与这些主要质量并不相似。</p>

A sufficient impulse there may be on the organ; but it not reaching the observation of the mind, there follows no perception: and though the motion that uses to produce the idea of sound be made in the ear, yet no sound is heard. Want of sensation, in this case, is not through any defect in the organ, or that the man’s ears are less affected than at other times when he does hear but that which uses to produce the idea, though conveyed in by the usual organ, not being taken notice of in the understanding, and so imprinting no idea in the mind, there follows no sensation.

		<p class="calibre5 en">Therefore I doubt not but children, by the exercise of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb receive some few ideas before they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies that environ them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer; amongst which (if one may conjecture concerning things not very capable of examination) I think the ideas of hunger and warmth are two: which probably are some of the first that children have, and which they scarce ever part with again.</p>

These here mentioned, being the effects of sensation, are only from some affections of the body, which happen to them there, and so depend on something exterior to the mind; no otherwise differing in their manner of production from other ideas derived from sense, but only in the precedency of time. Whereas those innate principles are supposed to be quite of another nature; not coming into the mind by any accidental alterations in, or operations on the body; but, as it were, original characters impressed upon it, in the very first moment of its being and constitution.</p>

And how covetous the mind is to be furnished with all such ideas as have no pain accompanying them, may be a little guessed by what is observable in children new-born; who always turn their eyes to that part from whence the light comes, lay them how you please. But the ideas that are most familiar at first, being various according to the divers circumstances of children’s first entertainment in the world, the order wherein the several ideas come at first into the mind is very various, and uncertain also; neither is it much material to know it.</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">We are further to consider concerning perception, that the ideas we receive by sensation are often, in grown people, altered by the judgment, without our taking notice of it. When we set before our eyes a round globe of any uniform colour, v.g. gold, alabaster, or jet, it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted on our mind is of a flat circle, variously shadowed, with several degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we having, by use, been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are wont to make in us; what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figures of bodies;—the judgment presently, by an habitual custom, alters the appearances into their causes. So that from that which is truly variety of shadow or colour, collecting the figure, it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames to itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour; when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured, as is evident in painting. To which purpose I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molineux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—“Suppose a man BORN blind, and now adult, and taught by his TOUCH to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether BY HIS SIGHT, BEFORE HE TOUCHED THEM, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?” To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, “Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube.”—I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that “having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.”</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们要进一步考虑关于知觉的问题，在成年人中，我们通过感觉接受的观念经常被判断力所改变，而我们却没有注意到这一点。当我们把一个颜色均匀的圆球放在我们眼前时，例如黄金、雪花石或水银，可以肯定的是，由此印在我们脑海中的想法是一个扁平的圆，有不同的阴影，有不同程度的光线和亮度传到我们的眼睛。但是，我们通过使用，已经习惯于察觉到凸面体在我们身上会产生什么样的外观；在光的反射中，由于体的可感数字的不同会产生什么样的变化；--判断力现在，通过一种习惯性的做法，把外观变成了它们的原因。因此，从真正的影子或颜色的多样性中收集到的图形，它使之成为图形的标志，并将凸起的图形和统一的颜色的感觉框在自己身上；而我们从那里得到的概念只是一个颜色各异的平面，这在绘画中是很明显的。为了这个目的，我在这里插入一个问题，这个问题是由真正的知识推广者、博学而有价值的莫林克斯先生提出的，他很高兴在几个月前的一封信中寄给我；它是这样的："假设一个人生来就是盲人，现在已经成年，并且通过他的触觉学会了区分相同金属的立方体和球体，而且几乎是相同大小的，这样，当他感觉到一个和另一个时，就能分辨哪个是立方体，哪个是球体。假设把立方体和球体放在桌子上，让盲人看见：那么，在他触摸它们之前，他是否能通过他的视觉分辨出哪个是球体，哪个是立方体？"对此，敏锐而明智的提议者回答说："不能。因为，尽管他已经获得了地球仪和立方体如何影响他的触觉的经验，但他还没有获得这样的经验，即如此或如此影响他的触觉的东西，一定会如此或如此影响他的视觉；或者立方体中的一个突起的角度，不平等地压迫他的手，将在他的眼睛中出现，正如它在立方体中一样。"我同意这位有思想的先生--我很自豪地称他为我的朋友--对这个问题的回答；我认为，盲人在第一眼看到它们时，不能肯定地说出哪个是地球，哪个是立方体；尽管他可以通过触摸准确无误地说出它们的名字，并通过感觉到的数字差异肯定会区分它们。我把这段话写下来，留给我的读者，作为一个机会，让他考虑一下，在他认为自己没有使用过或没有得到过帮助的情况下，他可能会对经验、改进和后天的概念有多大的依赖性。更重要的是，这位善于观察的先生进一步补充说，"在我的书中，他向许多非常聪明的人提出了这个问题，几乎没有人一开始就给出他认为正确的答案，直到听到他的理由，他们才相信。"</p>

Because sight, the most comprehensive of all our senses, conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours, which are peculiar only to that sense; and also the far different ideas of space, figure, and motion, the several varieties whereof change the appearances of its proper object, viz. light and colours; we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other. This, in many cases by a settled habit,—in things whereof we have frequent experience is performed so constantly and so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation which is an idea formed by our judgment; so that one, viz. that of sensation, serves only to excite the other, and is scarce taken notice of itself;—as a man who reads or hears with attention and understanding, takes little notice of the characters or sounds, but of the ideas that are excited in him by them.</p>

For, as itself is thought to take up no space to have no extension; so its actions seem to require no time but many of them seem to be crowded into an instant. I speak this in comparison to the actions of the body. Any one may easily observe this in his own thoughts, who will take the pains to reflect on them. How, as it were in an instant, do our minds, with one glance, see all the parts of a demonstration, which may very well be called a long one, if we consider the time it will require to put it into words, and step by step show it another? Secondly, we shall not be so much surprised that this is done in us with so little notice, if we consider how the facility which we get of doing things, by a custom of doing, makes them often pass in us without our notice. Habits, especially such as are begun very early, come at last to produce actions in us, which often escape our observation. How frequently do we, in a day, cover our eyes with our eyelids, without perceiving that we are at all in the dark! Men that, by custom, have got the use of a by-word, do almost in every sentence pronounce sounds which, though taken notice of by others, they themselves neither hear nor observe. And therefore it is not so strange, that our mind should often change the idea of its sensation into that of its judgment, and make one serve only to excite the other, without our taking notice of it.</p>

What good would sight and hearing do to a creature that cannot move itself to or from the objects wherein at a distance it perceives good or evil?

And that this may be so, we have plain instances, even in mankind itself. Take one in whom decrepit old age has blotted out the memory of his past knowledge, and clearly wiped out the ideas his mind was formerly stored with, and has, by destroying his sight, hearing, and smell quite, and his taste to a great degree, stopped up almost all the passages for new ones to enter; or if there be some of the inlets yet half open, the impressions made are scarcely perceived, or not at all retained. How far such an one (notwithstanding all that is boasted of innate principles) is in his knowledge and intellectual faculties above the condition of a cockle or an oyster, I leave to be considered. And if a man had passed sixty years in such a state, as it is possible he might, as well as three days, I wonder what difference there would be, in any intellectual perfections, between him and the lowest degree of animals.</p>

But this being in great variety of degrees (as may be perceived amongst men) cannot certainly be discovered in the several species of animals, much less in their particular individuals. It suffices me only to have remarked here,—that perception is the first operation of all our intellectual faculties, and the inlet of all knowledge in our minds. And I am apt too to imagine, that it is perception, in the lowest degree of it, which puts the boundaries between animals and the inferior ranks of creatures.

		<p class="calibre5 en">The other way of retention is, the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been as it were laid aside out of sight. And thus we do, when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet,—the object being removed. This is MEMORY, which is as it were the storehouse of our ideas. For, the narrow mind of man not being capable of having many ideas under view and consideration at once, it was necessary to have a repository, to lay up those ideas which, at another time, it might have use of. But, our IDEAS being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything; when there is no perception of them; this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this,—that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that IT HAS HAD THEM BEFORE. And in this sense it is that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere;—but only there is an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again, and as it were paint them anew on itself, though some with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings which, though we do not actually contemplate yet we CAN bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">保留的另一种方式是，有能力在我们的脑海中重新唤起那些经过印记后已经消失，或者已经被放在一边看不见的想法。因此，当我们设想热或光、黄或甜时，我们就会这样做，因为对象已经被移走了。这就是记忆，它是我们观念的仓库。因为，人的狭隘的头脑不可能同时看到和考虑到许多想法，所以有必要有一个仓库，把这些想法存放起来，以便在另一个时间可以使用。但是，我们的观念不过是头脑中的实际感知，当没有感知的时候，就不再是任何东西了；把我们的观念存放在记忆的仓库里，只意味着：在许多情况下，头脑有能力恢复它曾经有过的感知，并附加这种感知，即它曾经有过这些感知。在这个意义上，我们的观念被说成是在我们的记忆中，而实际上它们并不在任何地方；只是在头脑中存在着一种能力，当它愿意重新唤醒它们的时候，就像在自己身上重新涂抹一样，虽然有些更困难，有些不那么困难；有些更生动，有些更模糊。因此，在这种能力的帮助下，我们可以说在我们的理解中拥有所有这些想法，虽然我们没有实际考虑，但我们可以把它们带到眼前，并使它们再次出现，成为我们思想的对象，而不需要借助那些最初把它们印在那里的感性品质。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Attention and repetition help much to the fixing any ideas in the memory. But those which naturally at first make the deepest and most lasting impressions, are those which are accompanied with pleasure or pain. The great business of the senses being, to make us take notice of what hurts or advantages the body, it is wisely ordered by nature, as has been shown, that pain should accompany the reception of several ideas; which, supplying the place of consideration and reasoning in children, and acting quicker than consideration in grown men, makes both the old and young avoid painful objects with that haste which is necessary for their preservation; and in both settles in the memory a caution for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">注意力和重复对在记忆中固定任何想法有很大帮助。但那些最初自然会产生最深刻和最持久印象的，是那些伴随着快乐或痛苦的。感官的主要任务是使我们注意到对身体的伤害或好处，正如已经证明的那样，自然界明智地规定，在接受一些想法时应该伴随着疼痛；这在儿童中提供了考虑和推理的位置，在成年人中比考虑更快，使老人和年轻人都以保护他们所需的速度避免痛苦的对象；在两者中都在记忆中建立了对未来的警戒。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Concerning the several degrees of lasting, wherewith ideas are imprinted on the memory, we may observe,—that some of them have been produced in the understanding by an object affecting the senses once only, and no more than once; others, that have more than once offered themselves to the senses, have yet been little taken notice of: the mind, either heedless, as in children, or otherwise employed, as in men intent only on one thing; not setting the stamp deep into itself. And in some, where they are set on with care and repeated impressions, either through the temper of the body, or some other fault, the memory is very weak. In all these cases, ideas in the mind quickly fade, and often vanish quite out of the understanding, leaving no more footsteps or remaining characters of themselves than shadows do flying over fields of corn, and the mind is as void of them as if they had never been there.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">关于观念在记忆中的持久程度，我们可以看到，有些观念是由影响感官的物体在理解中产生的，只有一次，而且不超过一次；另一些观念则不止一次地提供给感官，但却很少被注意到：头脑要么不注意，如儿童，要么在其他方面，如人只想做一件事，没有把印记深入到自身。而在某些情况下，如果它们被小心翼翼地反复印证，要么是由于身体的脾气，要么是由于其他一些错误，记忆就会非常薄弱。在所有这些情况下，头脑中的想法很快就会消失，而且常常从理解中消失，没有留下更多的脚步声，也没有留下自己的特征，就像影子飞过玉米地一样，头脑中没有它们，好像它们从来没有出现过一样。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus many of those ideas which were produced in the minds of children, in the beginning of their sensation, (some of which perhaps, as of some pleasures and pains, were before they were born, and others in their infancy,) if in the future course of their lives they are not repeated again, are quite lost, without the least glimpse remaining of them. This may be observed in those who by some mischance have lost their sight when they were very young; in whom the ideas of colours having been but slightly taken notice of, and ceasing to be repeated, do quite wear out; so that some years after, there is no more notion nor memory of colours left in their minds, than in those of people born blind. The memory of some men, it is true, is very tenacious, even to a miracle. But yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which are struck deepest, and in minds the most retentive; so that if they be not sometimes renewed, by repeated exercise of the senses, or reflection on those kinds of objects which at first occasioned them, the print wears out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen. Thus the ideas, as well as children, of our youth, often die before us: and our minds represent to us those tombs to which we are approaching; where, though the brass and marble remain, yet the inscriptions are effaced by time, and the imagery moulders away. The pictures drawn in our minds are laid in fading colours; and if not sometimes refreshed, vanish and disappear. How much the constitution of our bodies are concerned in this; and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference, that in some it retains the characters drawn on it like marble, in others like freestone, and in others little better than sand, I shall here inquire; though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory, since we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas, and the flames of a fever in a few days calcine all those images to dust and confusion, which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，许多在儿童心中产生的观念，在他们的感觉开始时，（其中一些观念，如一些快乐和痛苦，可能是在他们出生前产生的，另一些是在他们的婴儿期产生的），如果在他们未来的生活过程中不再重复，就会完全消失，没有一丝一毫的剩余。在那些年幼时因某种不幸而失去视力的人身上可以看到这一点；在他们身上，颜色的概念只被稍微注意过，而且不再重复，就完全消失了；因此，在若干年后，在他们的脑海中没有留下任何关于颜色的概念或记忆，比那些天生失明的人更甚。诚然，有些人的记忆力非常顽强，甚至达到了奇迹的程度。但是，我们所有的观念似乎都在不断地衰退，即使是那些被打得最深、在头脑中最有记忆力的观念也是如此；因此，如果不通过反复锻炼感官，或对最初引起它们的那些物体进行反思，有时就会使它们更新，印记就会磨灭，最后就没有什么可看的。因此，我们年轻时的想法和孩子们常常在我们面前死去：我们的头脑对我们来说就像那些我们正在接近的坟墓；在那里，虽然黄铜和大理石还在，但铭文却被时间抹去了，图像也消失了。我们脑海中所画的图画是用褪色的颜色铺成的；如果有时不刷新，就会消失不见。我们的身体状况与此有多大关系；大脑的脾气是否会造成这种差异，即有些人的大脑像大理石一样保留着画在上面的文字，有些人的大脑像青石一样保留着，有些人的大脑比沙子好不了多少，我将在此询问；不过，身体的状况有时确实可能影响记忆，因为我们经常发现一种疾病完全剥夺了大脑的所有想法，而发烧的火焰在几天内将所有这些图像烧成灰尘和混乱，它们似乎像大理石上刻的一样持久。</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，关于观念本身，我们很容易注意到，那些最经常被刷新的观念（其中包括那些通过多种方式传入头脑的观念），通过经常回到产生这些观念的物体或行为，在记忆中固定下来，并在那里保持最清晰和最长的时间；因此，那些属于身体的原始品质的观念，即固体、延伸、形状、运动和静止；以及那些几乎经常影响我们的身体的观念，如热和冷；还有那些属于各种生物的影响的观念，如存在和持续时间和数量，这些观念几乎都是对我们的影响。因此，那些属于身体的原始品质的东西，即实体、延伸、形状、运动和静止；以及那些几乎一直影响我们身体的东西，如热和冷；还有那些属于各种生命的影响的东西，如存在、持续时间和数量，几乎每一个影响我们感官的物体，每一个运用我们头脑的思想，都会带来这些东西；我说，这些，以及类似的想法，很少会完全消失，而头脑却会保留任何想法。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">In this secondary perception, as I may so call it, or viewing again the ideas that are lodged in the memory, the mind is oftentimes more than barely passive; the appearance of those dormant pictures depending sometimes on the WILL. The mind very often sets itself on work in search of some hidden idea, and turns as it were the eye of the soul upon it; though sometimes too they start up in our minds of their own accord, and offer themselves to the understanding; and very often are roused and tumbled out of their dark cells into open daylight, by turbulent and tempestuous passions; our affections bringing ideas to our memory, which had otherwise lain quiet and unregarded. This further is to be observed, concerning ideas lodged in the memory, and upon occasion revived by the mind, that they are not only (as the word REVIVE imports) none of them new ones, but also that the mind takes notice of them as of a former impression, and renews its acquaintance with them, as with ideas it had known before. So that though ideas formerly imprinted are not all constantly in view, yet in remembrance they are constantly known to be such as have been formerly imprinted; i.e. in view, and taken notice of before, by the understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这种次要的感知中，我可以这样称呼它，或者说，再次观看那些停留在记忆中的观念，头脑往往不仅仅是被动的；那些休眠的图画的出现有时取决于WILL。心灵常常开始工作，寻找一些隐藏的想法，并把灵魂的眼睛转向它；尽管有时它们也会主动在我们的头脑中出现，并向理解力提供自己；而且常常被汹涌澎湃的激情唤醒，从黑暗的牢房中翻出，进入光明的世界；我们的情感把想法带到我们的记忆中，否则它们就会安静地躺在那里，不被人理会。还应注意的是，关于停留在记忆中的观念，在某些情况下被心灵唤醒，它们不仅不是新的观念（正如REVIVE一词的含义），而且心灵会像注意以前的印象一样注意它们，并像认识以前的观念一样重新认识它们。因此，尽管以前印记的观念并不总是在视野中，但在记忆中，它们总是被认为是以前印记过的；也就是说，在视野中，被理解力注意到的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, That it loses the idea quite, and so far it produces perfect ignorance. For, since we can know nothing further than we have the idea of it, when that is gone, we are in perfect ignorance.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，它完全失去了理念，到目前为止，它产生了完全的无知。因为，既然我们除了对它的想法之外，什么都不知道，当它消失时，我们就处于完全无知之中。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, That it moves slowly, and retrieves not the ideas that it has, and are laid up in store, quick enough to serve the mind upon occasion. This, if it be to a great degree, is stupidity; and he who, through this default in his memory, has not the ideas that are really preserved there, ready at hand when need and occasion calls for them, were almost as good be without them quite, since they serve him to little purpose. The dull man, who loses the opportunity, whilst he is seeking in his mind for those ideas that should serve his turn, is not much more happy in his knowledge than one that is perfectly ignorant. It is the business therefore of the memory to furnish to the mind those dormant ideas which it has present occasion for; in the having them ready at hand on all occasions, consists that which we call invention, fancy, and quickness of parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，它的动作缓慢，没有迅速收回它所拥有的、储存起来的思想，以便在必要时为头脑服务。这一点，如果是在很大程度上，就是愚蠢；由于记忆中的这种缺失，他没有真正保存在那里的想法，在需要和场合需要它们的时候随时准备好，几乎可以说是完全没有它们，因为它们对他没有什么用处。迟钝的人失去了机会，当他在头脑中寻找那些应该为他服务的想法时，他的知识并不比完全无知的人快乐多少。因此，记忆的任务是为头脑提供它目前需要的那些沉睡的想法；在任何情况下都有这些想法，包括我们所说的发明、幻想和快速的部分。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">These are defects we may observe in the memory of one man compared with another. There is another defect which we may conceive to be in the memory of man in general;—compared with some superior created intellectual beings, which in this faculty may so far excel man, that they may have CONSTANTLY in view the whole scene of all their former actions, wherein no one of the thoughts they have ever had may slip out of their sight. The omniscience of God, who knows all things, past, present, and to come, and to whom the thoughts of men’s hearts always lie open, may satisfy us of the possibility of this. For who can doubt but God may communicate to those glorious spirits, his immediate attendants, any of his perfections; in what proportions he pleases, as far as created finite beings can be capable? It is reported of that prodigy of parts, Monsieur Pascal, that till the decay of his health had impaired his memory, he forgot nothing of what he had done, read, or thought, in any part of his rational age. This is a privilege so little known to most men, that it seems almost incredible to those who, after the ordinary way, measure all others by themselves; but yet, when considered, may help us to enlarge our thoughts towards greater perfections of it, in superior ranks of spirits. For this of Monsieur Pascal was still with the narrowness that human minds are confined to here,—of having great variety of ideas only by succession, not all at once. Whereas the several degrees of angels may probably have larger views; and some of them be endowed with capacities able to retain together, and constantly set before them, as in one picture, all their past knowledge at once. This, we may conceive, would be no small advantage to the knowledge of a thinking man,—if all his past thoughts and reasonings could be ALWAYS present to him.

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这些是我们可以观察到的一个人与另一个人相比在记忆方面的缺陷。还有一个缺陷，我们可以认为是人的一般记忆力的缺陷；与一些被造的高级智力动物相比，它们在这种能力上可能远远超过人类，以至于它们可以不断地看到它们以前所有行为的整个场景，在那里它们曾经有过的思想没有一个可以从它们的视线中溜走。上帝无所不知，他知道过去、现在和将来的一切，而且人的心思总是向他敞开的，这可以使我们相信这种可能性。因为谁能怀疑，上帝可以把他的任何完美的东西传达给那些光荣的灵魂，他的直接随从；只要被创造的有限生命能够做到，他就可以按他喜欢的比例传达给他们？据报道，帕斯卡尔先生是个神童，在他健康状况恶化、记忆力下降之前，他对自己在理性时代的任何部分所做的事、所读的书、所想的事都没有忘记。这是一个大多数人都不知道的特权，对于那些按照通常的方式以自己为标准来衡量所有其他人的人来说，这几乎是不可思议的；但是，如果考虑到这一点，可能会帮助我们扩大我们的想法，在精神的高级等级中实现更完美的目标。因为帕斯卡尔先生的这一观点仍然与人类思想在这里的狭隘性相一致，即只有通过连续的方式才有大量的想法，而不是一下子就有。而不同等级的天使可能有更大的视野；他们中的一些人被赋予了能力，能够把他们过去所有的知识保留在一起，并不断地摆在他们面前，就像在一幅画中一样。我们可以设想，这对一个有思想的人的知识来说是不小的好处--如果他过去所有的思想和推理都能永远呈现在他面前。因此，我们可以认为这是一种方式，在这种方式中，独立的精神的知识可能远远超过我们。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This faculty of laying up and retaining the ideas that are brought into the mind, several other animals seem to have to a great degree, as well as man. For, to pass by other instances, birds learning of tunes, and the endeavours one may observe in them to hit the notes right, put it past doubt with me, that they have perception, and retain ideas in their memories, and use them for patterns. For it seems to me impossible that they should endeavour to conform their voices to notes (as it is plain they do) of which they had no ideas. For, though I should grant sound may mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirits in the brains of those birds, whilst the tune is actually playing; and that motion may be continued on to the muscles of the wings, and so the bird mechanically be driven away by certain noises, because this may tend to the bird’s preservation; yet that can never be supposed a reason why it should cause mechanically—either whilst the tune is playing, much less after it has ceased—such a motion of the organs in the bird’s voice as should conform it to the notes of a foreign sound, which imitation can be of no use to the bird’s preservation. But, which is more, it cannot with any appearance of reason be supposed (much less proved) that birds, without sense and memory, can approach their notes nearer and nearer by degrees to a tune played yesterday; which if they have no idea of in their memory, is now nowhere, nor can be a pattern for them to imitate, or which any repeated essays can bring them nearer to. Since there is no reason why the sound of a pipe should leave traces in their brains, which, not at first, but by their after-endeavours, should produce the like sounds; and why the sounds they make themselves, should not make traces which they should follow, as well as those of the pipe, is impossible to conceive.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这种储存和保留被带入脑海中的想法的能力，其他一些动物似乎和人类一样，在很大程度上也有。因为，撇开其他例子不谈，鸟类学习曲子，以及人们在它们身上看到的努力打出正确的音符，使我不再怀疑它们有感知能力，在它们的记忆中保留观念，并使用它们的模式。因为在我看来，他们不可能努力使自己的声音符合他们没有想法的音符（这一点很明显）。因为，虽然我承认声音可能会机械地引起那些鸟的大脑中的动物精神的某种运动，而曲调实际上是在演奏；这种运动可能会继续到翅膀的肌肉，因此鸟会被某些声音机械地赶走，因为这可能有助于鸟的保护。但是，这决不能成为一个理由，说明它应该机械地引起鸟儿声音中的器官的运动--无论是在曲子演奏时，还是在曲子停止后--使其符合外来声音的音符，而这种模仿对鸟儿的保护毫无用处。但是，更重要的是，不能以任何表面上的理由来假设（更不用说证明），没有感觉和记忆的鸟儿可以通过程度上的接近它们的音符，来接近昨天演奏的曲子；如果它们的记忆中没有这个概念，现在就不存在，也不可能成为它们模仿的模式，或者任何重复的文章可以使它们更接近。既然没有理由让烟斗的声音在他们的大脑中留下痕迹，而这些痕迹不是一开始就有的，而是通过他们之后的努力，产生类似的声音；为什么他们自己发出的声音不能像烟斗的声音一样产生他们应该遵循的痕迹，这是不可能想象的。</p>

It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general. Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge, though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now, and the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general, propositions, which have passed for innate truths;—because men, overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform impressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind, whereby it PERCEIVES two ideas to be the same, or different.

		<p class="calibre5 en">How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, that this is one of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,—so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,—that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another. This is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion; wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit, which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore is so acceptable to all people, because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is required no labour of thought to examine what truth or reason there is in it. The mind, without looking any further, rests satisfied with the agreeableness of the picture and the gaiety of the fancy. And it is a kind of affront to go about to examine it, by the severe rules of truth and good reason; whereby it appears that it consists in something that is not perfectly conformable to them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">准确辨别各种观念的缺陷在多大程度上在于感觉器官的迟钝或缺陷；或者是理解力不够敏锐、缺乏锻炼或注意力；或者是某些脾气所特有的匆忙和急躁，我在此不作研究：只要注意到这是心灵可以反思和观察自身的行动之一就够了。这对它的其他知识是有影响的，只要这种能力本身是迟钝的，或者没有正确地用于区分一件事和另一件事，那么我们的概念就会被混淆，我们的理性和判断力就会被干扰或误导。如果说，我们的观念在记忆中随手可得，就意味着部分的快速；在这一点上，我们的观念没有被混淆，并且能够很好地将一件事与另一件事区分开来，只要有最小的差别，就在很大程度上包括了判断的精确性和理智的清晰性，这在一个人身上是可以看到的。因此，也许可以为这一常见的观察提供一些理由--拥有大量智慧和快速记忆的人，并不总是有最清晰的判断和最深刻的理性。因为智慧最重要的是把各种想法集合在一起，并把那些可以找到任何相似或一致的想法放在一起，从而在想象中形成愉快的画面和令人愉快的幻觉；相反，判断力则完全在另一边，把可以找到最小差异的想法一个一个仔细分开，从而避免被相似性所误导，并通过亲和力把一个东西当作另一个。这是一种与比喻和影射完全相反的方式；其中大部分是机智的娱乐和乐趣，它如此生动地冲击着人们的想象力，因此为所有人所接受，因为它的美是一目了然的，不需要费心去研究其中的真理或理由。心灵不需要再看下去，就满足于画面的顺眼和想象的欢快。而用真理和理性的严格规则来审视它，则是一种侮辱；由此看来，它所包含的东西并不完全符合它们。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To the well distinguishing our ideas, it chiefly contributes that they be CLEAR and DETERMINATE. And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as sometimes they do) convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man’s mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritium, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.</p>

I imagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though they probably have several ideas distinct enough, yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly different, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.</p>

For, though they take in, and retain together, several combinations of simple ideas, as possibly the shape, smell, and voice of his master make up the complex idea a dog has of him, or rather are so many distinct marks whereby he knows him; yet I do not think they do of themselves ever compound them, and make complex ideas. And perhaps even where we think they have complex ideas, it is only one simple one that directs them in the knowledge of several things, which possibly they distinguish less by their sight than we imagine. For I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play with, and be fond of young foxes, as much as, and in place of her puppies, if you can but get them once to suck her so long that her milk may go through them. And those animals which have a numerous brood of young ones at once, appear not to have any knowledge of their number; for though they are mightily concerned for any of their young that are taken from them whilst they are in sight or hearing, yet if one or two of them be stolen from them in their absence, or without noise, they appear not to miss them, or to have any sense that their number is lessened.</p>

To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,—separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called ABSTRACTION, whereby ideas taken from particular beings become general representatives of all of the same kind; and their names general names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract ideas. Such precise, naked appearances in the mind, without considering how, whence, or with what others they came there, the understanding lays up (with names commonly annexed to them) as the standards to rank real existences into sorts, as they agree with these patterns, and to denominate them accordingly. Thus the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow, which the mind yesterday received from milk, it considers that appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name WHITENESS, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagined or met with; and thus universals, whether ideas or terms, are made.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">词语的使用是作为我们内在观念的外在标志，而这些观念来自于特定的事物，如果我们所接受的每一个特定的观念都有一个独特的名字，那么名字就必须是无穷无尽的。为了防止这种情况的发生，心灵会使从特定对象中得到的特定观念变得普遍；这是通过考虑它们在心灵中的表象来实现的，即与所有其他的存在以及现实存在的情况，如时间、地点或任何其他伴随的观念分开。这就是所谓的 "抽象"（ABSTRACTION），即从特定生命中提取的观念成为所有同类事物的一般代表；它们的名字是一般的名字，适用于符合这种抽象观念的任何存在。这种精确的、赤裸裸的显现在头脑中，而不考虑它们是如何、从何而来或与什么人一起出现的，理解力就会把它们（通常附有名称）作为标准，把真实的存在物分成各种类型，因为它们与这些模式一致，并相应地对它们进行命名。因此，今天在白垩或雪中观察到的颜色与昨天从牛奶中得到的颜色相同，它认为只有这种外观才能代表所有这类颜色；在给它起了白色这个名字后，它就用这个名字表示无论在哪里想象或遇到的相同质量；这样，无论是观念还是术语，普遍性就形成了。</p>

And, on the other side, men who, through some defect in the organs, want words, yet fail not to express their universal ideas by signs, which serve them instead of general words, a faculty which we see beasts come short in. And, therefore, I think, we may suppose, that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from man: and it is that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated, and which at last widens to so vast a distance. For if they have any ideas at all, and are not bare machines, (as some would have them,) we cannot deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me, that they do reason, as that they have sense; but it is only in particular ideas, just as they received them from their senses.

		<p class="calibre5 en">In fine, the defect in naturals seems to proceed from want of quickness, activity, and motion in the intellectual faculties, whereby they are deprived of reason; whereas madmen, on the other side, seem to suffer by the other extreme. For they do not appear to me to have lost the faculty of reasoning, but having joined together some ideas very wrongly, they mistake them for truths; and they err as men do that argue right from wrong principles. For, by the violence of their imaginations, having taken their fancies for realities, they make right deductions from them. Thus you shall find a distracted man fancying himself a king, with a right inference require suitable attendance, respect, and obedience: others who have thought themselves made of glass, have used the caution necessary to preserve such brittle bodies. Hence it comes to pass that a man who is very sober, and of a right understanding in all other things, may in one particular be as frantic as any in Bedlam; if either by any sudden very strong impression, or long fixing his fancy upon one sort of thoughts, incoherent ideas have been cemented together so powerfully, as to remain united. But there are degrees of madness, as of folly; the disorderly jumbling ideas together is in some more, and some less. In short, herein seems to lie the difference between idiots and madmen: that madmen put wrong ideas together, and so make wrong propositions, but argue and reason right from them; but idiots make very few or no propositions, and reason scarce at all.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">总之，自然人的缺陷似乎是由于智力能力缺乏快速、活跃和运动，因此他们被剥夺了理性；而另一方面，疯子似乎受到另一个极端的影响。因为在我看来，他们并没有失去推理的能力，而是把一些想法非常错误地结合在一起，误以为是真理；他们的错误就像那些从错误的原则中论证正确的人那样。因为，由于他们的想象力太强，把他们的幻想当成了现实，他们就从这些幻想中作出正确的推论。因此，你会发现一个心烦意乱的人幻想自己是个国王，并以正确的推论要求适当的出席、尊重和服从：另一些人认为自己是玻璃做的，就用必要的谨慎来保护这种脆弱的身体。因此，一个非常清醒的人，在其他所有事情上都有正确的认识，但在某个方面却可能像在床铺上的人一样疯狂；如果不是因为突然产生了非常强烈的印象，就是因为他的幻想长期固定在一种想法上，不连贯的想法被有力地粘合在一起，从而保持一致。但是，疯狂和愚蠢是有程度之分的；无序地将各种想法拼凑在一起，有的人多，有的人少。简而言之，白痴和疯子之间的区别似乎就在这里：疯子把错误的想法放在一起，因此提出了错误的主张，但却从这些主张中进行论证和推理；但白痴却很少或没有提出主张，而且根本不推理。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">These, I think, are the first faculties and operations of the mind, which it makes use of in understanding; and though they are exercised about all its ideas in general, yet the instances I have hitherto given have been chiefly in simple ideas. And I have subjoined the explication of these faculties of the mind to that of simple ideas, before I come to what I have to say concerning complex ones, for these following reasons:—</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为，这些是心灵的第一种能力和操作，它在理解中使用这些能力和操作；虽然它们一般都是针对所有的想法而行使的，但我迄今所举的例子主要是在简单的想法中。我在阐述简单概念之前，先把这些思维能力的解释与简单概念的解释联系起来，然后再谈我对复杂概念的看法，原因如下： --</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, Because several of these faculties being exercised at first principally about simple ideas, we might, by following nature in its ordinary method, trace and discover them, in their rise, progress, and gradual improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，由于这些能力中的一些起初主要是针对简单的想法而行使的，我们可以通过遵循自然界的正常方法，追踪和发现它们的兴起、进展和逐步改进。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, Because observing the faculties of the mind, how they operate about simple ideas,—which are usually, in most men’s minds, much more clear, precise, and distinct than complex ones,—we may the better examine and learn how the mind extracts, denominates, compares, and exercises, in its other operations about those which are complex, wherein we are much more liable to mistake. Thirdly, Because these very operations of the mind about ideas received from sensations, are themselves, when reflected on, another set of ideas, derived from that other source of our knowledge, which I call reflection; and therefore fit to be considered in this place after the simple ideas of sensation. Of compounding, comparing, abstracting, &amp;c., I have but just spoken, having occasion to treat of them more at large in other places.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，因为观察心灵的能力，它们是如何对简单的观念进行操作的--在大多数人的头脑中，简单的观念通常比复杂的观念更加清晰、精确和明确，我们可以更好地研究和学习心灵是如何对复杂的观念进行提取、命名、比较和操作的，在这方面我们更容易犯错误。第三，因为心灵对从感觉中得到的观念的这些操作，在反思时，本身就是另一套观念，来自我们知识的另一个来源，我称之为反思；因此，在这个地方，适合在感觉的简单观念之后考虑。关于复合、比较、抽象等等，我刚刚说过，有机会在其他地方更详细地论述它们。</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我给出了一个简短的，而且我认为是真实的人类知识的最初起源的历史；--头脑从什么时候开始有了最初的目标；以及它通过什么步骤进展到奠定和储存这些想法，从这些想法中形成它所能够得到的所有知识。其中，我必须求助于经验和观察，以确定我的观点是否正确：了解真相的最佳途径是按照事物的真实情况进行研究，而不是按照我们自己的想象或者别人教给我们的想象来断定它们是什么。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To deal truly, this is the only way that I can discover, whereby the IDEAS OF THINGS are brought into the understanding. If other men have either innate ideas or infused principles, they have reason to enjoy them; and if they are sure of it, it is impossible for others to deny them the privilege that they have above their neighbours. I can speak but of what I find in myself, and is agreeable to those notions, which, if we will examine the whole course of men in their several ages, countries, and educations, seem to depend on those foundations which I have laid, and to correspond with this method in all the parts and degrees thereof.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">说实话，这是我能发现的唯一方法，通过这种方法，事物的观念被带入理解。如果其他人有先天的观念或注入的原则，他们就有理由享受这些观念；如果他们确信这一点，其他人就不可能拒绝他们拥有的高于其邻居的特权。我只能说我在自己身上发现的、与那些观念相一致的东西，如果我们要考察人在不同的年龄、国家和教育中的整个过程，这些观念似乎取决于我所奠定的那些基础，并在其所有部分和程度上与这种方法相一致。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">I pretend not to teach, but to inquire; and therefore cannot but confess here again,—that external and internal sensation are the only passages I can find of knowledge to the understanding. These alone, as far as I can discover, are the windows by which light is let into this DARK ROOM. For, methinks, the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light, with only some little openings left, to let in external visible resemblances, or ideas of things without: which, would they but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much resemble the understanding of a man, in reference to all objects of sight, and the ideas of them.</p>
</div>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我不是在教书，而是在探究；因此，我不得不在此再次承认--外部和内部的感觉是我能找到的唯一能让人理解的通道。就我所知，只有这些才是让光线进入这个黑暗房间的窗户。因为，我认为，理解力并不像一个完全与光线隔绝的壁橱，只留下一些小的开口，让外部可见的相似物，或外部事物的观念进入其中：如果这些相似物留在那里，并有序地躺在那里，以便偶尔被发现，它就会非常像一个人的理解力，涉及到所有视觉对象，以及对它们的观念。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">1.由心智造出的简单的人。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">We have hitherto considered those ideas, in the reception whereof the mind is only passive, which are those simple ones received from sensation and reflection before mentioned, whereof the mind cannot make one to itself, nor have any idea which does not wholly consist of them. As simple ideas are observed to exist in several combinations united together, so the mind has a power to consider several of them united together as one idea; and that not only as they are united in external objects, but as itself has joined them together. Ideas thus made up of several simple ones put together, I call COMPLEX;—such as are beauty, gratitude, a man, an army, the universe; which, though complicated of various simple ideas, or complex ideas made up of simple ones, yet are, when the mind pleases, considered each by itself, as one entire thing, signified by one name.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">迄今为止，我们已经考虑了那些观念，在接受这些观念时，心灵只是被动的，也就是前面提到的从感觉和思考中接受的那些简单的观念，在这些观念中，心灵不能使自己成为一个整体，也不能有任何不完全由它们组成的观念。由于简单的观念被观察到存在于几个结合在一起的组合中，所以心灵有能力将几个结合在一起的观念视为一个观念；这不仅是由于它们在外部物体中的结合，而且是由于它自己将它们结合在一起。这样由几个简单的概念组成的概念，我称之为复合概念；例如美、感激、人、军队、宇宙；虽然这些概念是由各种简单的概念组成的，或者由简单的概念组成的复合概念，但是，当心灵喜欢的时候，可以把每个概念本身视为一个整体，用一个名字表示。</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">In this faculty of repeating and joining together its ideas, the mind has great power in varying and multiplying the objects of its thoughts, infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection furnished it with: but all this still confined to those simple ideas which it received from those two sources, and which are the ultimate materials of all its compositions. For simple ideas are all from things themselves, and of these the mind CAN have no more, nor other than what are suggested to it. It can have no other ideas of sensible qualities than what come from without [*dropped word] the senses; nor any ideas of other kind of operations of a thinking substance, than what it finds in itself. But when it has once got these simple ideas, it is not confined barely to observation, and what offers itself from without; it can, by its own power, put together those ideas it has, and make new complex ones, which it never received so united.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这种重复和连接其观念的能力中，心灵有很大的能力来改变和增加其思想的对象，无限地超越感觉或反思所提供的东西：但这一切仍然限于那些它从这两个来源得到的简单观念，而这些观念是其所有构成的最终材料。因为简单的观念都是来自于事物本身，在这些观念中，除了向它建议的以外，心灵不能有更多的，也不能有其他的。除了来自感官以外的东西，它不可能有其他关于感性品质的想法；除了它在自己身上发现的东西，它也不可能有关于思维物质的其他运作的想法。但是，当它一旦有了这些简单的观念，它就不会仅仅局限于观察和来自外部的东西；它可以凭借自己的力量，把它所拥有的那些观念组合起来，并产生新的复杂的观念，而这些观念是它从未接受过的。</p>

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">复杂的思想，无论如何复合和反复合，尽管它们的数量是无限的，种类也是无穷无尽的，它们充斥着人的思想，但我认为它们都可以归结为以下三个标题：1.模式。 2.物质。3.关系。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, MODES I call such complex ideas which, however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as dependences on, or affections of substances;—such as are the ideas signified by the words triangle, gratitude, murder, &amp;c. And if in this I use the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary signification, I beg pardon; it being unavoidable in discourses, differing from the ordinary received notions, either to make new words, or to use old words in somewhat a new signification; the later whereof, in our present case, is perhaps the more tolerable of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我把这种复杂的观念称为模式，这种观念尽管是复合的，但不包含本身存在的假设，而是被视为对物质的依赖或影响；例如三角形、感激、谋杀等词所象征的观念。如果我在这里使用的模式这个词与它的普通含义有些不同，请原谅；在与普通的公认概念不同的论述中，不可避免地要创造新词，或者以新的含义使用旧词；在我们目前的情况下，后一种情况也许是两种情况中更可容忍的。</p>

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这些模式中，有两种模式值得单独考虑。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, there are some which are only variations, or different combinations of the same simple idea, without the mixture of any other;—as a dozen, or score; which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added together, and these I call SIMPLE MODES as being contained within the bounds of one simple idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，有一些只是变化，或同一简单概念的不同组合，没有任何其他的混合；--如一打，或乐谱；这只不过是许多不同单位的概念加在一起，这些我称之为简单模式，因为它们包含在一个简单概念的范围之内。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, there are others compounded of simple ideas of several kinds, put together to make one complex one;—v.g. beauty, consisting of a certain composition of colour and figure, causing delight to the beholder; theft, which being the concealed change of the possession of anything, without the consent of the proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas of several kinds: and these I call MIXED MODES.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">其次，还有一些由几种简单的观念组成的复合体，把它们放在一起成为一个复杂的观念；例如，美，由颜色和身材的某种组合组成，使欣赏者感到高兴；偷窃，是未经所有者同意而隐蔽地改变对任何东西的占有，其中包含着，如可见的，几种观念的组合：这些我称之为混合模式。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">6. Ideas of Substances, single or collective.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">6.物质的概念，单一或集体。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, the ideas of SUBSTANCES are such combinations of simple ideas as are taken to represent distinct PARTICULAR things subsisting by themselves; in which the supposed or confused idea of substance, such as it is, is always the first and chief. Thus if to substance be joined the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour, with certain degrees of weight, hardness, ductility, and fusibility, we have the idea of lead; and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort of figure, with the powers of motion, thought and reasoning, joined to substance, make the ordinary idea of a man. Now of substances also, there are two sorts of ideas:—one of SINGLE substances, as they exist separately, as of a man or a sheep; the other of several of those put together, as an army of men, or flock of sheep—which COLLECTIVE ideas of several substances thus put together are as much each of them one single idea as that of a man or an unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，物质的观念是简单观念的组合，被认为代表了单独存在的特定事物；在这些观念中，假定的或混乱的物质观念，如它，总是第一和主要的。因此，如果把某种暗淡的白色，以及某种程度的重量、硬度、延展性和可熔性的简单概念与物质结合起来，我们就有了铅的概念；而把某种身材，以及运动、思考和推理能力的概念与物质结合起来，就有了人的普通概念。现在，就物质而言，也有两种观念：一种是单独的物质，因为它们是单独存在的，如一个人或一只羊；另一种是几种物质组合在一起的，如一支人的军队或一群羊，这些由几种物质组成的集体观念就像一个人或一个单位的观念一样。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">If we trace the progress of our minds, and with attention observe how it repeats, adds together, and unites its simple ideas received from sensation or reflection, it will lead us further than at first perhaps we should have imagined. And, I believe, we shall find, if we warily observe the originals of our notions, that EVEN THE MOST ABSTRUSE IDEAS, how remote soever they may seem from sense, or from any operations of our own minds, are yet only such as the understanding frames to itself, by repeating and joining together ideas that it had either from objects of sense, or from its own operations about them: so that those even large and abstract ideas are derived from sensation or reflection, being no other than what the mind, by the ordinary use of its own faculties, employed about ideas received from objects of sense, or from the operations it observes in itself about them, may, and does, attain unto.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果我们追踪我们思想的进展，并注意观察它是如何重复、增加和结合从感觉或思考中得到的简单想法的，它将引导我们走得比起初也许我们应该想象的更远。我相信，如果我们谨慎地观察我们概念的起源，我们就会发现，即使是最抽象的概念，无论它们看起来与感官或我们自己的头脑的任何操作有多么遥远，都只是理解力通过重复和连接它从感官对象或从它自己对它们的操作中获得的概念而自己形成的。因此，那些即使是大的和抽象的观念也是从感觉或反思中得来的，并不是别的，而是头脑通过正常使用自己的能力，对从感官对象中得到的观念，或从它自己观察到的关于它们的操作中得到的观念，可能并且确实达到的。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">This I shall endeavour to show in the ideas we have of space, time, and infinity, and some few others that seem the most remote, from those originals.</p>

When considered between the extremities of matter, which fills the capacity of space with something solid, tangible, and moveable, it is properly called EXTENSION. And so extension is an idea belonging to body only; but space may, as is evident, be considered without it. At least I think it most intelligible, and the best way to avoid confusion, if we use the word extension for an affection of matter or the distance of the extremities of particular solid bodies; and space in the more general signification, for distance, with or without solid matter possessing it.</p>

Men having, by accustoming themselves to stated lengths of space, which they use for measuring other distances—as a foot, a yard or a fathom, a league, or diameter of the earth—made those ideas familiar to their thoughts, can, in their minds, repeat them as often as they will, without mixing or joining to them the idea of body, or anything else; and frame to themselves the ideas of long, square, or cubic feet, yards or fathoms, here amongst the bodies of the universe, or else beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies; and, by adding these still one to another, enlarge their ideas of space as much as they please. The power of repeating or doubling any idea we have of any distance, and adding it to the former as often as we will, without being ever able to come to any stop or stint, let us enlarge it as much as we will, is that which gives us the idea of IMMENSITY.</p>

This the touch discovers in sensible bodies, whose extremities come within our reach; and the eye takes both from bodies and colours, whose boundaries are within its view: where, observing how the extremities terminate,—either in straight lines which meet at discernible angles, or in crooked lines wherein no angles can be perceived; by considering these as they relate to one another, in all parts of the extremities of any body or space, it has that idea we call FIGURE, which affords to the mind infinite variety. For, besides the vast number of different figures that do really exist in the coherent masses of matter, the stock that the mind has in its power, by varying the idea of space, and thereby making still new compositions, by repeating its own ideas, and joining them as it pleases, is perfectly inexhaustible.

So also the lines that are its sides, of what length it pleases, which joining again to other lines, of different lengths, and at different angles, till it has wholly enclosed any space, it is evident that it can multiply figures, both in their shape and capacity, IN INFINITUM; all which are but so many different simple modes of space.</p>

As in simple space, we consider the relation of distance between any two bodies or points; so in our idea of place, we consider the relation of distance betwixt anything, and any two or more points, which are considered as keeping the same distance one with another, and so considered as at rest. For when we find anything at the same distance now which it was yesterday, from any two or more points, which have not since changed their distance one with another, and with which we then compared it, we say it hath kept the same place: but if it hath sensibly altered its distance with either of those points, we say it hath changed its place: though, vulgarly speaking, in the common notion of place, we do not always exactly observe the distance from these precise points, but from larger portions of sensible objects, to which we consider the thing placed to bear relation, and its distance from which we have some reason to observe.</p>

The chess-board, we also say, is in the same place it was, if it remain in the same part of the cabin, though perhaps the ship which it is in sails all the while. And the ship is said to be in the same place, supposing it kept the same distance with the parts of the neighbouring land; though perhaps the earth hath turned round, and so both chess-men, and board, and ship, have every one changed place, in respect of remoter bodies, which have kept the same distance one with another. But yet the distance from certain parts of the board being that which determines the place of the chess-men; and the distance from the fixed parts of the cabin (with which we made the comparison) being that which determined the place of the chess-board; and the fixed parts of the earth that by which we determined the place of the ship,—these things may be said to be in the same place in those respects: though their distance from some other things, which in this matter we did not consider, being varied, they have undoubtedly changed place in that respect; and we ourselves shall think so, when we have occasion to compare them with those other.</p>

Thus in the chess-board, the use of the designation of the place of each chess-man being determined only within that chequered piece of wood, it would cross that purpose to measure it by anything else; but when these very chess-men are put up in a bag, if any one should ask where the black king is, it would be proper to determine the place by the part of the room it was in, and not by the chessboard; there being another use of designing the place it is now in, than when in play it was on the chessboard, and so must be determined by other bodies. So if any one should ask, in what place are the verses which report the story of Nisus and Euryalus, it would be very improper to determine this place, by saying, they were in such a part of the earth, or in Bodley’s library: but the right designation of the place would be by the parts of Virgil’s works; and the proper answer would be, that these verses were about the middle of the ninth book of his AEneids, and that they have been always constantly in the same place ever since Virgil was printed: which is true, though the book itself hath moved a thousand times, the use of the idea of place here being, to know in what part of the book that story is, that so, upon occasion, we may know where to find it, and have recourse to it for use.</p>

For to say that the world is somewhere, means no more than that it does exist; this, though a phrase borrowed from place, signifying only its existence, not location: and when one can find out, and frame in his mind, clearly and distinctly the place of the universe, he will be able to tell us whether it moves or stands still in the undistinguishable inane of infinite space: though it be true that the word place has sometimes a more confused sense, and stands for that space which anybody takes up; and so the universe is in a place.

It is true, solidity cannot exist without extension, neither can scarlet colour exist without extension, but this hinders not, but that they are distinct ideas.

As if one, asking what a fibre was, I should answer him,—that it was a thing made up of several fibres. Would he thereby be enabled to understand what a fibre was better than he did before? Or rather, would he not have reason to think that my design was to make sport with him, rather than seriously to instruct him?</p>

Names made at pleasure, neither alter the nature of things, nor make us understand them, but as they are signs of and stand for determined ideas. And I desire those who lay so much stress on the sound of these two syllables, SUBSTANCE, to consider whether applying it, as they do, to the infinite, incomprehensible God, to finite spirits, and to body, it be in the same sense; and whether it stands for the same idea, when each of those three so different beings are called substances. If so, whether it will thence follow—that God, spirits, and body, agreeing in the same common nature of substance, differ not any otherwise than in a bare different MODIFICATION of that substance; as a tree and a pebble, being in the same sense body, and agreeing in the common nature of body, differ only in a bare modification of that common matter, which will be a very harsh doctrine. If they say, that they apply it to God, finite spirit, and matter, in three different significations and that it stands for one idea when God is said to be a substance; for another when the soul is called substance; and for a third when body is called so;—if the name substance stands for three several distinct ideas, they would do well to make known those distinct ideas, or at least to give three distinct names to them, to prevent in so important a notion the confusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of so doubtful a term; which is so far from being suspected to have three distinct, that in ordinary use it has scarce one clear distinct signification.

If body be not supposed infinite, (which I think no one will affirm,) I would ask, whether, if God placed a man at the extremity of corporeal beings, he could not stretch his hand beyond his body? If he could, then he would put his arm where there was before space without body; and if there he spread his fingers, there would still be space between them without body. If he could not stretch out his hand, it must be because of some external hindrance; (for we suppose him alive, with such a power of moving the parts of his body that he hath now, which is not in itself impossible, if God so pleased to have it; or at least it is not impossible for God so to move him:) and then I ask,—whether that which hinders his hand from moving outwards be substance or accident, something or nothing? And when they have resolved that, they will be able to resolve themselves,—what that is, which is or may be between two bodies at a distance, that is not body, and has no solidity. In the mean time, the argument is at least as good, that, where nothing hinders, (as beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies,) a body put in motion may move on, as where there is nothing between, there two bodies must necessarily touch. For pure space between is sufficient to take away the necessity of mutual contact; but bare space in the way is not sufficient to stop motion. The truth is, these men must either own that they think body infinite, though they are loth to speak it out, or else affirm that space is not body. For I would fain meet with that thinking man that can in his thoughts set any bounds to space, more than he can to duration; or by thinking hope to arrive at the end of either. And therefore, if his idea of eternity be infinite, so is his idea of immensity; they are both finite or infinite alike.</p>

Whoever then will allow that God can, during such a general rest, ANNIHILATE either this book or the body of him that reads it, must necessarily admit the possibility of a vacuum. For, it is evident that the space that was filled by the parts of the annihilated body will still remain, and be a space without body. For the circumambient bodies being in perfect rest, are a wall of adamant, and in that state make it a perfect impossibility for any other body to get into that space. And indeed the necessary motion of one particle of matter into the place from whence another particle of matter is removed, is but a consequence from the supposition of plenitude; which will therefore need some better proof than a supposed matter of fact, which experiment can never make out;—our own clear and distinct ideas plainly satisfying that there is no necessary connexion between space and solidity, since we can conceive the one without the other. And those who dispute for or against a vacuum, do thereby confess they have distinct IDEAS of vacuum and plenum, i. e. that they have an idea of extension void of solidity, though they deny its EXISTENCE; or else they dispute about nothing at all. For they who so much alter the signification of words, as to call extension body, and consequently make the whole essence of body to be nothing but pure extension without solidity, must talk absurdly whenever they speak of vacuum; since it is impossible for extension to be without extension. For vacuum, whether we affirm or deny its existence, signifies space without body; whose very existence no one can deny to be possible, who will not make matter infinite, and take from God a power to annihilate any particle of it.</p>

For I desire any one so to divide a solid body, of any dimension he pleases, as to make it possible for the solid parts to move up and down freely every way within the bounds of that superficies, if there be not left in it a void space as big as the least part into which he has divided the said solid body. And if, where the least particle of the body divided is as big as a mustard-seed, a void space equal to the bulk of a mustard-seed be requisite to make room for the free motion of the parts of the divided body within the bounds of its superficies, where the particles of matter are 100,000,000 less than a mustard-seed, there must also be a space void of solid matter as big as 100,000,000 part of a mustard-seed; for if it hold in the one it will hold in the other, and so on IN INFINITUM. And let this void space be as little as it will, it destroys the hypothesis of plenitude. For if there can be a space void of body equal to the smallest separate particle of matter now existing in nature, it is still space without body; and makes as great a difference between space and body as if it were mega chasma, a distance as wide as any in nature. And therefore, if we suppose not the void space necessary to motion equal to the least parcel of the divided solid matter, but to 1/10 or 1/1000 of it, the same consequence will always follow of space without matter.</p>

We have not any two more distinct ideas; and we can as easily conceive space without solidity, as we can conceive body or space without motion, though it be never so certain that neither body nor motion can exist without space. But whether any one will take space to be only a RELATION resulting from the existence of other beings at a distance; or whether they will think the words of the most knowing King Solomon, ‘The heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee;’ or those more emphatical ones of the inspired philosopher St. Paul, ‘In him we live, move, and have our being,’ are to be understood in a literal sense, I leave every one to consider: only our idea of space is, I think, such as I have mentioned, and distinct from that of body. For, whether we consider, in matter itself, the distance of its coherent solid parts, and call it, in respect of those solid parts, extension; or whether, considering it as lying between the extremities of any body in its several dimensions, we call it length, breadth, and thickness; or else, considering it as lying between any two bodies or positive beings, without any consideration whether there be any matter or not between, we call it distance;—however named or considered, it is always the same uniform simple idea of space, taken from objects about which our senses have been conversant; whereof, having settled ideas in our minds, we can revive, repeat, and add them one to another as often as we will, and consider the space or distance so imagined, either as filled with solid parts, so that another body cannot come there without displacing and thrusting out the body that was there before; or else as void of solidity, so that a body of equal dimensions to that empty or pure space may be placed in it, without the removing or expulsion of anything that was, there.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">总结：不管人们对真空的存在有什么看法，对我来说，这一点是很清楚的，即我们对不同于实体的空间有同样清晰的概念，就像我们对不同于运动的实体，或不同于空间的运动有同样清晰的概念。我们没有更多的两个不同的概念；我们可以很容易地想象出没有实体的空间，就像我们可以想象出没有运动的身体或空间一样，尽管从来没有那么肯定，没有空间，身体或运动都不可能存在。但是，是否有人会认为空间只是一种因其他生命的存在而产生的关系；或者他们是否会认为最有见识的所罗门王的话：'天，以及天中之天，都不能容纳你'；或者受启发的哲学家圣保罗的那些更强调的话语：'我们在他里面生活，运动，有我们的存在'，都应该从字面上理解，我让每个人考虑：我认为，只有我们的空间概念是像我提到的那样，并且与身体的概念不同。因为，无论我们是否考虑到，在物质本身中，其连贯的固体部分的距离，并且就这些固体部分而言，称之为延伸；或者，无论我们是否考虑到它位于任何身体的几个维度的两端之间，我们称之为长度、宽度和厚度；或者，考虑到它位于任何两个身体或实在存在之间，不考虑中间是否有任何物质，我们称之为距离；--无论如何命名或考虑，它总是相同的统一的简单空间概念，取自我们感官已经熟悉的物体。如果在我们的头脑中形成了固定的概念，我们就可以随心所欲地恢复、重复和增加它们，并认为这样想象出来的空间或距离，要么是充满了固体部分，所以另一个身体如果不取代和推开之前在那里的身体，就不能到那里去；要么是没有固体，所以一个与那个空的或纯的空间有同等尺寸的身体可以放在里面，而不需要移除或赶走那里的任何东西。</p>

For I am apt to think that men, when they come to examine them, find their simple ideas all generally to agree, though in discourse with one another they perhaps confound one another with different names. I imagine that men who abstract their thoughts, and do well examine the ideas of their own minds, cannot much differ in thinking; however they may perplex themselves with words, according to the way of speaking of the several schools or sects they have been bred up in: though amongst unthinking men, who examine not scrupulously and carefully their own ideas, and strip them not from the marks men use for them, but confound them with words, there must be endless dispute, wrangling, and jargon; especially if they be learned, bookish men, devoted to some sect, and accustomed to the language of it, and have learned to talk after others. But if it should happen that any two thinking men should really have different ideas, I do not see how they could discourse or argue one with another. Here I must not be mistaken, to think that every floating imagination in men’s brains is presently of that sort of ideas I speak of. It is not easy for the mind to put off those confused notions and prejudices it has imbibed from custom, inadvertency, and common conversation. It requires pains and assiduity to examine its ideas, till it resolves them into those clear and distinct simple ones, out of which they are compounded; and to see which, amongst its simple ones, have or have not a NECESSARY connexion and dependence one upon another. Till a man doth this in the primary and original notions of things, he builds upon floating and uncertain principles, and will often find himself at a loss.</p>

Duration, time, and eternity, are, not without reason, thought to have something very abstruse in their nature. But however remote these may seem from our comprehension, yet if we trace them right to their originals, I doubt not but one of those sources of all our knowledge, viz. sensation and reflection, will be able to furnish us with these ideas, as clear and distinct as many others which are thought much less obscure; and we shall find that the idea of eternity itself is derived from the same common original with the rest of our ideas.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To understand TIME and ETERNITY aright, we ought with attention to consider what idea it is we have of DURATION, and how we came by it. It is evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own mind, that there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in his understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on these appearances of several ideas one after another in our minds, is that which furnishes us with the idea of SUCCESSION: and the distance between any parts of that succession, or between the appearance of any two ideas in our minds, is that we call DURATION. For whilst we are thinking, or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist; and so we call the existence, or the continuation of the existence of ourselves, or anything else, commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or any such other thing co-existent with our thinking.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">为了正确理解时间和永恒，我们应该注意考虑我们对时间的概念是什么，以及我们如何得到它。任何一个人只要观察一下自己头脑中的情况，就会发现，只要他还醒着，就会有一连串的想法在他的理解中不断地相互延续。对这些在我们头脑中一个接一个出现的想法的反思，为我们提供了连续的概念：而这种连续的任何部分之间的距离，或者任何两个想法在我们头脑中出现的距离，我们称之为持续时间。因为当我们在思考的时候，或者当我们在头脑中连续接受几个观念的时候，我们知道我们确实存在；所以我们把我们自己的存在或者存在的延续，或者与我们头脑中任何观念的连续相称的任何其他东西，称为我们自己的持续时间，或者与我们思考同时存在的任何其他东西。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">That we have our notion of succession and duration from this original, viz. from reflection on the train of ideas, which we find to appear one after another in our own minds, seems plain to me, in that we have no perception of duration but by considering the train of ideas that take their turns in our understandings. When that succession of ideas ceases, our perception of duration ceases with it; which every one clearly experiments in himself, whilst he sleeps soundly, whether an hour or a day, a month or a year; of which duration of things, while he sleeps or thinks not, he has no perception at all, but it is quite lost to him; and the moment wherein he leaves off to think, till the moment he begins to think again, seems to him to have no distance. And so I doubt not it would be to a waking man, if it were possible for him to keep ONLY ONE idea in his mind, without variation and the succession of others. And we see, that one who fixes his thoughts very intently on one thing, so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas that pass in his mind whilst he is taken up with that earnest contemplation, lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration, and thinks that time shorter than it is. But if sleep commonly unites the distant parts of duration, it is because during that time we have no succession of ideas in our minds. For if a man, during his sleep, dreams, and variety of ideas make themselves perceptible in his mind one after another, he hath then, during such dreaming, a sense of duration, and of the length of it. By which it is to me very clear, that men derive their ideas of duration from their reflections on the train of the ideas they observe to succeed one another in their own understandings; without which observation they can have no notion of duration, whatever may happen in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我看来，我们对连续和持续时间的概念是来自于这一原始概念，即来自于对我们发现在我们自己的头脑中一个接一个出现的想法的思考，因为除了考虑在我们的理解中轮流出现的想法之外，我们没有对持续时间的认识。当这种观念的连续停止时，我们对持续时间的感知也随之停止；每个人都在自己身上清楚地实验过，当他酣睡时，无论是一小时还是一天，一个月还是一年；当他睡觉或不思考时，他对事物的持续时间完全没有感知，而是完全失去了感知；当他离开思考的时刻，直到他再次开始思考的时刻，对他来说似乎没有距离。对一个清醒的人来说，如果他能在脑海中只保留一个想法，而没有变化和其他想法的延续，我相信情况也会如此。我们看到，一个人如果把他的思想集中在一件事情上，以至于在他认真思考的时候，很少注意到在他脑海中传递的各种想法，那么他就会从他的账户中漏掉很长时间，并认为那段时间比实际时间短。但是，如果睡眠通常将时间的远近结合起来，那是因为在那段时间里，我们的头脑中没有思想的连续性。因为如果一个人在睡眠中做梦，各种想法在他的头脑中一个接一个地被感知，那么在这种梦境中，他就会有一种持续时间的感觉，以及它的长度。在我看来，这就很清楚了，人的时间观念来自于他们对自己的理解中所观察到的接连不断的观念的反思；没有这种观察，无论世界上发生什么，他们都不可能有时间观念。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Indeed a man having, from reflecting on the succession and number of his own thoughts, got the notion or idea of duration, he can apply that notion to things which exist while he does not think; as he that has got the idea of extension from bodies by his sight or touch, can apply it to distances, where no body is seen or felt. And therefore, though a man has no perception of the length of duration which passed whilst he slept or thought not; yet, having observed the revolution of days and nights, and found the length of their duration to be in appearance regular and constant, he can, upon the supposition that that revolution has proceeded after the same manner whilst he was asleep or thought not, as it used to do at other times, he can, I say, imagine and make allowance for the length of duration whilst he slept. But if Adam and Eve, (when they were alone in the world,) instead of their ordinary night’s sleep, had passed the whole twenty-four hours in one continued sleep, the duration of that twenty-four hours had been irrecoverably lost to them, and been for ever left out of their account of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">的确，一个人从反思他自己思想的连续和数量中得到了持续时间的概念或想法，他可以把这个概念应用于他不思考时存在的事物；就像他通过视觉或触觉得到身体延伸的概念，可以把它应用于没有看到或感觉到身体的距离。因此，尽管一个人对他睡觉或不思考时的时间长度没有感知；但是，如果他观察了白天和黑夜的旋转，并发现它们的时间长度在外观上是有规律的和恒定的，他就可以在假设这种旋转在他睡觉或不思考时以同样的方式进行，就像它在其他时候一样，我说，他可以想象并允许他睡觉时的时间长度。但是，如果亚当和夏娃，（当他们独自在这个世界上时），不是他们普通的夜间睡眠，而是在一次持续的睡眠中度过了整个二十四小时，那么这二十四小时的持续时间对他们来说已经无可挽回地失去了，并且永远地被排除在他们的时间帐户之外。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus by reflecting on the appearing of various ideas one after another in our understandings, we get the notion of succession; which, if any one should think we did rather get from our observation of motion by our senses, he will perhaps be of my mind when he considers, that even motion produces in his mind an idea of succession no otherwise than as it produces there a continued train of distinguishable ideas. For a man looking upon a body really moving, perceives yet no motion at all unless that motion produces a constant train of successive ideas: v.g. a man becalmed at sea, out of sight of land, in a fair day, may look on the sun, or sea, or ship, a whole hour together, and perceive no motion at all in either; though it be certain that two, and perhaps all of them, have moved during that time a great way. But as soon as he perceives either of them to have changed distance with some other body, as soon as this motion produces any new idea in him, then he perceives that there has been motion. But wherever a man is, with all things at rest about him, without perceiving any motion at all,—if during this hour of quiet he has been thinking, he will perceive the various ideas of his own thoughts in his own mind, appearing one after another, and thereby observe and find succession where he could observe no motion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，通过思考各种观念一个接一个地出现在我们的理解中，我们得到了连续的概念；如果有人认为我们是通过我们的感官观察运动而得到的，那么当他考虑到即使运动在他的头脑中产生连续的观念，也不外乎在那里产生一连串可区分的观念时，他也许会同意我的看法。因为一个人看着一个真正运动的物体，根本感觉不到运动，除非这个运动产生了一连串持续不断的观念：例如，一个在海上漂泊的人，在一个晴朗的日子里，看不到陆地，他可能整整看了一个小时的太阳、大海或船，却根本感觉不到任何运动；尽管可以肯定的是，在这段时间里，它们中的两个，也许全部，都运动了很远。但是，一旦他察觉到其中任何一个物体与其他物体的距离发生了变化，一旦这种运动在他心中产生了任何新的想法，那么他就察觉到有运动存在。但是，无论一个人在哪里，在他周围所有的东西都处于静止状态，根本没有察觉到任何运动，--如果在这一小时的安静中，他一直在思考，他将察觉到他自己头脑中的各种想法，一个接一个地出现，从而在他无法观察到运动的地方观察并发现连续不断。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">And this, I think, is the reason why motions very slow, though they are constant, are not perceived by us; because in their remove from one sensible part towards another, their change of distance is so slow, that it causes no new ideas in us, but a good while one after another. And so not causing a constant train of new ideas to follow one another immediately in our minds, we have no perception of motion; which consisting in a constant succession, we cannot perceive that succession without a constant succession of varying ideas arising from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为，这就是为什么非常缓慢的运动，尽管它们是恒定的，但我们却感觉不到；因为在它们从一个感性部分移向另一个感性部分的过程中，它们的距离变化是如此缓慢，以至于它没有在我们心中引起新的想法，而是一个接一个的好一会儿。因此，如果不能在我们的头脑中立即引起一列不断的新观念，我们就没有对运动的感知；运动包括不断的连续，如果没有由它产生的不断连续的变化的观念，我们就不能感知这种连续。</p>

This appearance of theirs in train, though perhaps it may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower, yet, I guess, varies not very much in a waking man: there seem to be certain bounds to the quickness and slowness of the succession of those ideas one to another in our minds, beyond which they can neither delay nor hasten.</p>

Let a cannon-bullet pass through a room, and in its way take with it any limb, or fleshy parts of a man, it is as clear as any demonstration can be, that it must strike successively the two sides of the room: it is also evident, that it must touch one part of the flesh first, and another after, and so in succession: and yet, I believe, nobody who ever felt the pain of such a shot, or heard the blow against the two distant walls, could perceive any succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke. Such a part of duration as this, wherein we perceive no succession, is that which we call an INSTANT, and is that which takes up the time of only one idea in our minds, without the succession of another; wherein, therefore, we perceive no succession at all.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我之所以提出这个奇怪的猜想，是因为我观察到，在我们的任何感官上产生的印象中，我们只能在一定程度上察觉到任何连续；如果速度过快，就会失去连续的感觉，即使在很明显存在真正的连续的情况下。让一发炮弹穿过一个房间，并在途中带走一个人的任何肢体或肉体部分，这就像任何证明一样清楚，它必须先后击中房间的两边：同样明显的是，它必须先碰到肉体的一个部分，然后再碰到另一个部分，如此连续进行：然而，我相信，没有人感受过这种射击的痛苦，或听到对远处两面墙壁的打击，能在如此迅速的打击的痛苦或声音中感知到任何连续。像这样的持续时间的一部分，我们没有察觉到连续，这就是我们所说的瞬间，是在我们头脑中只占一个想法的时间，而没有另一个想法的连续；因此，在这里，我们根本没有察觉到连续。</p>

For men, in the measuring of the length of time, having been accustomed to the ideas of minutes, hours, days, months, years, &amp;c., which they found themselves upon any mention of time or duration presently to think on, all which portions of time were measured out by the motion of those heavenly bodies, they were apt to confound time and motion; or at least to think that they had a necessary connexion one with another. Whereas any constant periodical appearance, or alteration of ideas, in seemingly equidistant spaces of duration, if constant and universally observable, would have as well distinguished the intervals of time, as those that have been made use of. For, supposing the sun, which some have taken to be a fire, had been lighted up at the same distance of time that it now every day comes about to the same meridian, and then gone out again about twelve hours after, and that in the space of an annual revolution it had sensibly increased in brightness and heat, and so decreased again,—would not such regular appearances serve to measure out the distances of duration to all that could observe it, as well without as with motion?

For a fit of an ague; the sense of hunger or thirst; a smell or a taste; or any other idea returning constantly at equidistant periods, and making itself universally be taken notice of, would not fail to measure out the course of succession, and distinguish the distances of time. Thus we see that men born blind count time well enough by years, whose revolutions yet they cannot distinguish by motions that they perceive not. And I ask whether a blind man, who distinguished his years either by the heat of summer, or cold of winter; by the smell of any flower of the spring, or taste of any fruit of the autumn, would not have a better measure of time than the Romans had before the reformation of their calendar by Julius Caesar, or many other people, whose years, notwithstanding the motion of the sun, which they pretended to make use of, are very irregular? And it adds no small difficulty to chronology, that the exact lengths of the years that several nations counted by, are hard to be known, they differing very much one from another, and I think I may say all of them from the precise motion of the sun. And if the sun moved from the creation to the flood constantly in the equator, and so equally dispersed its light and heat to all the habitable parts of the earth, in days all of the same length without its annual variations to the tropics, as a late ingenious author supposes, I do not think it very easy to imagine, that (notwithstanding the motion of the sun) men should in the antediluvian world, from the beginning, count by years, or measure their time by periods that had no sensible mark very obvious to distinguish them by.</p>

To which I answer,—the equality of any other returning appearances might be known by the same way that that of days was known, or presumed to be so at first; which was only by judging of them by the train of ideas which had passed in men’s minds in the intervals; by which train of ideas discovering inequality in the natural days, but none in the artificial days, the artificial days, or nuchthaemera, were guessed to be equal, which was sufficient to make them serve for a measure; though exacter search has since discovered inequality in the diurnal revolutions of the sun, and we know not whether the annual also be not unequal. These yet, by their presumed and apparent equality, serve as well to reckon time by (though not to measure the parts of duration exactly) as if they could be proved to be exactly equal. We must, therefore, carefully distinguish betwixt duration itself, and the measures we make use of to judge of its length. Duration, in itself, is to be considered as going on in one constant, equal, uniform course: but none of the measures of it which we make use of can be KNOWN to do so, nor can we be assured that their assigned parts or periods are equal in duration one to another; for two successive lengths of duration, however measured, can never be demonstrated to be equal. The motion of the sun, which the world used so long and so confidently for an exact measure of duration, has, as I said, been found in its several parts unequal. And though men have, of late, made use of a pendulum, as a more steady and regular motion than that of the sun, or, (to speak more truly,) of the earth;—yet if any one should be asked how he certainly knows that the two successive swings of a pendulum are equal, it would be very hard to satisfy him that they are infallibly so; since we cannot be sure that the cause of that motion, which is unknown to us, shall always operate equally; and we are sure that the medium in which the pendulum moves is not constantly the same: either of which varying, may alter the equality of such periods, and thereby destroy the certainty and exactness of the measure by motion, as well as any other periods of other appearances; the notion of duration still remaining clear, though our measures of it cannot (any of them) be demonstrated to be exact. Since then no two portions of succession can be brought together, it is impossible ever certainly to know their equality. All that we can do for a measure of time is, to take such as have continual successive appearances at seemingly equidistant periods; of which seeming equality we have no other measure, but such as the train of our own ideas have lodged in our memories, with the concurrence of other PROBABLE reasons, to persuade us of their equality.</p>

Nor indeed does motion any otherwise conduce to the measuring of duration, than as it constantly brings about the return of certain sensible ideas, in seeming equidistant periods. For if the motion of the sun were as unequal as of a ship driven by unsteady winds, sometimes very slow, and at others irregularly very swift; or if, being constantly equally swift, it yet was not circular, and produced not the same appearances,—it would not at all help us to measure time, any more than the seeming unequal motion of a comet does.</p>

But it being at least as conceivable as the contrary, I have certainly the liberty to suppose it, as well as any one hath to suppose the contrary; and I doubt not, but that every one that will go about it, may easily conceive in his mind the beginning of motion, though not of all duration, and so may come to a step and non ultra in his consideration of motion. So also, in his thoughts, he may set limits to body, and the extension belonging to it; but not to space, where no body is, the utmost bounds of space and duration being beyond the reach of thought, as well as the utmost bounds of number are beyond the largest comprehension of the mind; and all for the same reason, as we shall see in another place.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">By the same means, therefore, and from the same original that we come to have the idea of time, we have also that idea which we call Eternity; viz. having got the idea of succession and duration, by reflecting on the train of our own ideas, caused in us either by the natural appearances of those ideas coming constantly of themselves into our waking thoughts, or else caused by external objects successively affecting our senses; and having from the revolutions of the sun got the ideas of certain lengths of duration,—we can in our thoughts add such lengths of duration to one another, as often as we please, and apply them, so added, to durations past or to come. And this we can continue to do on, without bounds or limits, and proceed in infinitum, and apply thus the length of the annual motion of the sun to duration, supposed before the sun’s or any other motion had its being, which is no more difficult or absurd, than to apply the notion I have of the moving of a shadow one hour to-day upon the sun-dial to the duration of something last night, v. g. the burning of a candle, which is now absolutely separate from all actual motion; and it is as impossible for the duration of that flame for an hour last night to co-exist with any motion that now is, or for ever shall be, as for any part of duration, that was before the beginning of the world, to co exist with the motion of the sun now. But yet this hinders not but that, having the IDEA of the length of the motion of the shadow on a dial between the marks of two hours, I can as distinctly measure in my thoughts the duration of that candle-light last night, as I can the duration of anything that does now exist: and it is no more than to think, that, had the sun shone then on the dial, and moved after the same rate it doth now, the shadow on the dial would have passed from one hour-line to another whilst that flame of the candle lasted.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，通过同样的方式，并从我们产生时间观念的同一原点出发，我们也产生了我们称之为永恒的观念；也就是说，通过反思我们自己的观念路线，在我们身上产生了连续和持续的观念，这些观念要么是自然出现在我们清醒的思想中，要么是由外部物体相继引起的。我们通过反思我们自己的观念，得到了连续和持续的观念，这些观念在我们心中要么是由这些观念的自然表象不断进入我们清醒的思想，要么是由外部物体连续影响我们的感官而引起的；我们从太阳的旋转中得到了某些持续时间的观念，我们可以在我们的思想中把这些持续时间的长度互相增加，只要我们愿意，并把它们这样增加，应用到过去或未来的持续时间。我们可以继续这样做，没有界限或限制，无限地进行下去，并这样把太阳的年度运动的长度应用于在太阳或任何其他运动存在之前假定的持续时间，这并不更困难或荒谬，就像把我对今天在日晷上移动一小时的影子的概念应用于昨晚某事的持续时间，如蜡烛的燃烧，它现在与所有实际的运动是绝对分开的；昨晚火焰的持续时间一小时不可能与现在或将来的任何运动共存，就像世界开始之前的任何部分持续时间与现在的太阳运动共存一样。但是，这并不妨碍我对表盘上的影子在两个小时之间的运动长度有一个认识，我可以在我的思想中清楚地测量昨晚烛光的持续时间，就像我可以测量现在确实存在的任何东西的持续时间一样：这不过是在想，如果太阳当时照在表盘上，并以现在同样的速度运动，表盘上的影子就会在蜡烛的火焰持续的时候从一个小时线传到另一个小时线。</p>

And if the common reckoning of 5639 should be true, (as it may be as well as any other assigned,) it hinders not at all my imagining what others mean, when they make the world one thousand years older, since every one may with the same facility imagine (I do not say believe) the world to be 50,000 years old, as 5639; and may as well conceive the duration of 50,000 years as 5639. Whereby it appears that, to the measuring the duration of anything by time, it is not requisite that that thing should be co-existent to the motion we measure by, or any other periodical revolution; but it suffices to this purpose, that we have the idea of the length of ANY regular periodical appearances, which we can in our minds apply to duration, with which the motion or appearance never co-existed.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我们看到，有些人认为世界的持续时间，从最初的存在到现在的1689年，是5639年，或相当于太阳的5639个年轮，而另一些人则更多；如古埃及人，在亚历山大的时代，他们从太阳的统治算起有23000年。和现在的中国人，他们认为世界有3,269,000年的历史，甚至更多；根据他们的计算，世界的时间更长，虽然我不相信这是真的，但我也可以和他们一样想象，并且真正理解，说一个比另一个长，就像我理解，麦瑟勒斯的生命比伊诺克的长。如果普通的5639年的计算是真实的，（它可能和任何其他分配的计算一样），它一点也不妨碍我想象其他人的意思，当他们把世界变老一千年的时候，因为每个人都可以以同样的便利想象（我不说相信）世界有5万年的历史，就像5639年一样；也可以像5639年一样设想5万年的时间。由此可见，要用时间来衡量任何事物的持续时间，并不要求该事物与我们所衡量的运动或任何其他周期性的革命同时存在；但为此目的，我们有一个关于任何定期出现的长度的想法就足够了，我们可以在头脑中把它用于持续时间，而运动或出现从未与之同时存在。</p>

For, if I can but consider duration equal to one minute, before either the being or motion of any body, I can add one minute more till I come to sixty; and by the same way of adding minutes, hours, or years (i.e. such or such parts of the sun’s revolutions, or any other period whereof I have the idea) proceed IN INFINITUM, and suppose a duration exceeding as many such periods as I can reckon, let me add whilst I will, which I think is the notion we have of eternity; of whose infinity we have no other notion than we have of the infinity of number, to which we can add for ever without end.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Though we have in the precedent chapters dwelt pretty long on the considerations of space and duration, yet, they being ideas of general concernment, that have something very abstruse and peculiar in their nature, the comparing them one with another may perhaps be of use for their illustration; and we may have the more clear and distinct conception of them by taking a view of them together. Distance or space, in its simple abstract conception, to avoid confusion, I call EXPANSION, to distinguish it from extension, which by some is used to express this distance only as it is in the solid parts of matter, and so includes, or at least intimates, the idea of body: whereas the idea of pure distance includes no such thing. I prefer also the word expansion to space, because space is often applied to distance of fleeting successive parts, which never exist together, as well as to those which are permanent. In both these (viz. expansion and duration) the mind has this common idea of continued lengths, capable of greater or less quantities. For a man has as clear an idea of the difference of the length of an hour and a day, as of an inch and a foot.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">虽然我们在前面的章节中已经对空间和时间的考虑进行了相当长的讨论，但是，由于它们是普遍关注的概念，在其性质上有一些非常深奥和特殊的东西，将它们相互比较也许对它们的说明有帮助；我们可以通过将它们放在一起看而对它们有更清楚和明确的概念。距离或空间，在其简单的抽象概念中，为了避免混淆，我称之为扩展，以区别于延伸，有些人只用来表达这种距离，因为它是在物质的固体部分，所以包括，或至少暗示，身体的概念：而纯粹的距离的概念不包括这种东西。比起空间，我更喜欢扩张这个词，因为空间经常被应用于转瞬即逝的连续部分的距离，这些部分永远不会一起存在，也被应用于那些永久性的部分。在这两种情况下（即扩张和持续时间），头脑中都有这种持续长度的共同概念，能够有更大或更小的数量。因为一个人对一小时和一天的长度的区别，就像对一英寸和一英尺的区别一样清楚。</p>

</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The mind, having got the idea of the length of any part of expansion, let it be a span, or a pace, or what length you will, CAN, as has been said, repeat that idea, and so, adding it to the former, enlarge its idea of length, and make it equal to two spans, or two paces; and so, as often as it will, till it equals the distance of any parts of the earth one from another, and increase thus till it amounts to the distance of the sun or remotest star. By such a progression as this, setting out from the place where it is, or any other place, it can proceed and pass beyond all those lengths, and find nothing to stop its going on, either in or without body. It is true, we can easily in our thoughts come to the end of SOLID extension; the extremity and bounds of all body we have no difficulty to arrive at: but when the mind is there, it finds nothing to hinder its progress into this endless expansion; of that it can neither find nor conceive any end. Nor let any one say, that beyond the bounds of body, there is nothing at all; unless he will confine God within the limits of matter. Solomon, whose understanding was filled and enlarged with wisdom, seems to have other thoughts when he says, ‘Heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee.’ And he, I think, very much magnifies to himself the capacity of his own understanding, who persuades himself that he can extend his thoughts further than God exists, or imagine any expansion where He is not.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">心灵在得到扩张的任何部分的长度的概念后，让它成为一个跨度，或一个步伐，或任何你想要的长度，如前所述，可以重复这个概念，因此，在前者的基础上，扩大它的长度概念，并使它等于两个跨度，或两个步伐；如此，只要它愿意，直到它等于地球上任何部分的距离，并以此增加，直到它相当于太阳或最遥远的星星的距离。通过这样的进展，从它所在的地方或任何其他地方出发，它可以继续前进并通过所有这些长度，并且没有发现任何东西可以阻止它继续前进，无论是在体内还是在体外。的确，在我们的思想中，我们可以很容易地走到实体延伸的尽头；所有身体的极限和界限我们都不难到达：但当思想在那里时，它发现没有什么可以阻碍它进入这种无尽的扩张；它既找不到也想象不到任何尽头。也不要让任何人说，在身体的界限之外，根本就没有什么；除非他将上帝限制在物质的界限之内。所罗门的理解力被智慧所充满和扩大，当他说：'天，和天中的天，都不能容纳你'时，似乎有其他想法。我认为他非常夸大了自己的理解能力，他认为自己可以把自己的思想延伸到比上帝存在的地方，或者想象上帝不存在的地方的任何扩展。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Just so is it in duration. The mind having got the idea of any length of duration, CAN double, multiply, and enlarge it, not only beyond its own, but beyond the existence of all corporeal beings, and all the measures of time, taken from the great bodies of all the world and their motions. But yet every one easily admits, that, though we make duration boundless, as certainly it is, we cannot yet extend it beyond all being. God, every one easily allows, fills eternity; and it is hard to find a reason why any one should doubt that he likewise fills immensity. His infinite being is certainly as boundless one way as another; and methinks it ascribes a little too much to matter to say, where there is no body, there is nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在时间上也是如此。心灵有了任何时间长度的概念，就可以把它翻倍、增殖和扩大，不仅超越它自己，而且超越所有肉体生命的存在，以及从全世界的大物体和它们的运动中得出的所有时间尺度。但是，每个人都很容易承认，尽管我们使时间无边无际，因为它肯定是无边无际的，但我们还不能把它扩展到所有的存在。每个人都很容易承认，上帝充满了永恒；而且很难找到一个理由，让任何人怀疑他也充满了无限。他无限的存在肯定是无边无际的；我想，说没有身体的地方就没有东西，这对物质来说有点过分了。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Hence I think we may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least hesitation speaks of and supposes Eternity, and sticks not to ascribe INFINITY to DURATION; but it is with more doubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the INFINITY OF SPACE. The reason whereof seems to me to be this,—That duration and extension being used as names of affections belonging to other beings, we easily conceive in God infinite duration, and we cannot avoid doing so: but, not attributing to him extension, but only to matter, which is finite, we are apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter; of which alone we commonly suppose it an attribute. And, therefore, when men pursue their thoughts of space, they are apt to stop at the confines of body: as if space were there at an end too, and reached no further. Or if their ideas, upon consideration, carry them further, yet they term what is beyond the limits of the universe, imaginary space: as if IT were nothing, because there is no body existing in it. Whereas duration, antecedent to all body, and to the motions which it is measured by, they never term imaginary: because it is never supposed void of some other real existence. And if the names of things may at all direct our thoughts towards the original of men’s ideas, (as I am apt to think they may very much,) one may have occasion to think by the name DURATION, that the continuation of existence, with a kind of resistance to any destructive force, and the continuation of solidity (which is apt to be confounded with, and if we will look into the minute anatomical parts of matter, is little different from, hardness) were thought to have some analogy, and gave occasion to words so near of kin as durare and durum esse. And that durare is applied to the idea of hardness, as well as that of existence, we see in Horace, Epod. xvi. ferro duravit secula. But, be that as it will, this is certain, that whoever pursues his own thoughts, will find them sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body, into the infinity of space or expansion; the idea whereof is distinct and separate from body and all other things: which may, (to those who please,) be a subject of further meditation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我认为我们可以了解为什么每个人都熟悉地、毫不犹豫地谈论和假设永恒，并坚持不把无限性归于持续时间；但许多人承认或假设空间的无限性时，却有更多的怀疑和保留。其中的原因在我看来是这样的--持续时间和延伸被用作属于其他生命的情感的名称，我们很容易在上帝身上设想出无限的持续时间，而且我们无法避免这样做：但是，不把延伸归于他，而只归于物质，而物质是有限的，我们更容易怀疑没有物质的扩张是否存在；只有物质，我们通常认为它是一个属性。因此，当人们追求他们对空间的想法时，他们很容易停在身体的界限上：仿佛空间在那里也是一个终点，不再延伸。或者，如果他们的想法，经过考虑，把他们带到了更远的地方，但他们把宇宙界限之外的东西称为想象的空间：好像它什么都不是，因为没有身体存在于其中。而在所有的身体和它所测量的运动之前的时间，他们从来没有称之为虚无的：因为它从来没有被认为是没有其他真实的存在。如果事物的名称可以将我们的思想引向人的观念的原点，（我倾向于认为它们很有可能），那么人们可能有机会通过 "持续 "这个名称想到，存在的延续，对任何破坏性力量的一种抵抗。坚固性的延续（这很容易与物质的细微解剖部分相混淆，而且如果我们愿意研究一下物质的细微解剖部分，就会发现它与硬度没有什么区别）被认为有某种相似性，并产生了像durare和durum esse这样近似的词。我们在贺拉斯的书信中看到，durare既适用于硬度的概念，也适用于存在的概念，即ferro duravit secula。但是，无论如何，可以肯定的是，无论谁追求自己的思想，都会发现它们有时会超出身体的范围，进入无限的空间或扩展；其中的想法与身体和所有其他事物是不同的、独立的：（对那些愿意的人来说）这可能是一个进一步沉思的主题。</p>

These, rightly considered, are only ideas of determinate distances from certain known points, fixed in distinguishable sensible things, and supposed to keep the same distance one from another. From such points fixed in sensible beings we reckon, and from them we measure our portions of those infinite quantities; which, so considered, are that which we call TIME and PLACE. For duration and space being in themselves uniform and boundless, the order and position of things, without such known settled points, would be lost in them; and all things would lie jumbled in an incurable confusion.</p>

For, if we should suppose the creation, or fall of the angels, was at the beginning of the Julian period, we should speak properly enough, and should be understood if we said, it is a longer time since the creation of angels than the creation of the world, by 7640 years: whereby we would mark out so much of that undistinguished duration as we suppose equal to, and would have admitted, 7640 annual revolutions of the sun, moving at the rate it now does. And thus likewise we sometimes speak of place, distance, or bulk, in the great INANE, beyond the confines of the world, when we consider so much of that space as is equal to, or capable to receive, a body of any assigned dimensions, as a cubic foot; or do suppose a point in it, at such a certain distance from any part of the universe.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">其次，有时时间这个词被用在更大的意义上，并被应用于那无限的持续时间的一部分，而不是那些真正被区分和测量出来的真实存在，以及身体的周期性运动，从一开始就被指定为标志、季节、日子和年，并相应地成为我们的时间量度；但那无限的统一持续时间的其他部分，我们在任何场合都认为等于某些测量的时间长度；并因此认为它们是有界限和确定的。因为，如果我们假设天使的创造或堕落是在朱利安时期的开始，我们就应该说得很恰当，如果我们说，从天使的创造到现在比世界的创造要长7640年，就应该被理解：这样，我们就会在那无差别的时间中标出我们认为等于，并承认太阳以现在的速度每年转7640圈的部分。同样地，我们有时也会在世界范围之外的大INANE中说到位置、距离或体积，当我们考虑到该空间中相当于或能够接受任何指定尺寸的物体，如一立方英尺；或者假设其中有一个点，与宇宙的任何部分有一定的距离。</p>

Without some such fixed parts or periods, the order of things would be lost, to our finite understandings, in the boundless invariable oceans of duration and expansion, which comprehend in them all finite beings, and in their full extent belong only to the Deity. And therefore we are not to wonder that we comprehend them not, and do so often find our thoughts at a loss, when we would consider them, either abstractly in themselves, or as any way attributed to the first incomprehensible Being. But when applied to any particular finite beings, the extension of any body is so much of that infinite space as the bulk of the body takes up. And place is the position of any body, when considered at a certain distance from some other. As the idea of the particular duration of anything is, an idea of that portion of infinite duration which passes during the existence of that thing; so the time when the thing existed is, the idea of that space of duration which passed between some known and fixed period of duration, and the being of that thing. One shows the distance of the extremities of the bulk or existence of the same thing, as that it is a foot square, or lasted two years; the other shows the distance of it in place, or existence from other fixed points of space or duration, as that it was in the middle of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, or the first degree of Taurus, and in the year of our Lord 1671, or the 1000th year of the Julian period.

		<p class="calibre5 en">There is one thing more wherein space and duration have a great conformity, and that is, though they are justly reckoned amongst our SIMPLE IDEAS, yet none of the distinct ideas we have of either is without all manner of composition: it is the very nature of both of them to consist of parts: but their parts being all of the same kind, and without the mixture of any other idea, hinder them not from having a place amongst simple ideas. Could the mind, as in number, come to so small a part of extension or duration as excluded divisibility, THAT would be, as it were, the indivisible unit or idea; by repetition of which, it would make its more enlarged ideas of extension and duration. But, since the mind is not able to frame an idea of ANY space without parts, instead thereof it makes use of the common measures, which, by familiar use in each country, have imprinted themselves on the memory (as inches and feet; or cubits and parasangs; and so seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years in duration);—the mind makes use, I say, of such ideas as these, as simple ones: and these are the component parts of larger ideas, which the mind upon occasion makes by the addition of such known lengths which it is acquainted with. On the other side, the ordinary smallest measure we have of either is looked on as an unit in number, when the mind by division would reduce them into less fractions. Though on both sides, both in addition and division, either of space or duration, when the idea under consideration becomes very big or very small, its precise bulk becomes very obscure and confused; and it is the NUMBER of its repeated additions or divisions that alone remains clear and distinct; as will easily appear to any one who will let his thoughts loose in the vast expansion of space, or divisibility of matter. Every part of duration is duration too; and every part of extension is extension, both of them capable of addition or division in infinitum. But THE LEAST PORTIONS OF EITHER OF THEM, WHEREOF WE HAVE CLEAR AND DISTINCT IDEAS, may perhaps be fittest to be considered by us, as the simple ideas of that kind out of which our complex modes of space, extension, and duration are made up, and into which they can again be distinctly resolved. Such a small part in duration may be called a MOMENT, and is the time of one idea in our minds, in the train of their ordinary succession there. The other, wanting a proper name, I know not whether I may be allowed to call a SENSIBLE POINT, meaning thereby the least particle of matter or space we can discern, which is ordinarily about a minute, and to the sharpest eyes seldom less than thirty seconds of a circle, whereof the eye is the centre.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">还有一件事，空间和持续时间有很大的一致性，那就是，尽管它们被合理地算作我们的简单概念，但我们对其中任何一个的独特概念都不是没有各种组成方式的：它们的本质都是由部分组成的：但它们的部分都是同类的，没有任何其他概念的混合，阻碍了它们在简单概念中的地位。如果心智像数字一样，达到延伸或持续时间的如此小的一部分，排除了可分割性，那就会成为不可分割的单位或观念；通过重复这些观念，它将产生更多的延伸和持续时间的观念。但是，由于头脑无法建立一个没有部分的任何空间的概念，因此它利用了普通的度量衡，这些度量衡由于在每个国家的熟悉使用，已经在记忆中打下了烙印（如英寸和英尺；或立方体和伞形体；以及持续时间中的秒、分、小时、天和年）；我说，头脑利用了这些概念，作为简单的概念：这些是较大概念的组成部分，头脑偶尔会通过增加它所熟悉的已知长度而形成这些想法。在另一方面，我们对其中任何一个的普通最小尺度都被看作是一个数字单位，而头脑会通过分割将它们减少到更小的分数中。尽管在空间或持续时间的加法和除法两方面，当所考虑的概念变得非常大或非常小时，其精确的体积变得非常模糊和混乱；而只有其反复加法或除法的数值才保持清晰和明确；正如任何一个将他的思想放任在空间的巨大扩张或物质的可分割性中的人将很容易看到的。持续时间的每一部分也是持续时间；延伸的每一部分也是延伸，它们都能够无限地增加或分割。但是，其中最小的部分，我们有清晰明确的概念，也许最适合被我们视为那种简单的概念，我们的空间、延伸和持续时间的复杂模式就是由这些概念组成的，而且它们又可以被明确地分解为这些概念。持续时间中的这样一个小部分可以被称为MOMENT，是一个概念在我们头脑中的时间，是它们在那里的普通继承过程中的时间。另一个，由于没有合适的名称，我不知道是否可以称之为 "感觉点"，意思是我们能够辨别的物质或空间的最小颗粒，通常是一分钟左右，对最敏锐的眼睛来说，很少少于30秒的圆，而眼睛是圆心。</p>

For this present moment is common to all things that are now in being, and equally comprehends that part of their existence, as much as if they were all but one single being; and we may truly say, they all exist in the SAME moment of time. Whether angels and spirits have any analogy to this, in respect to expansion, is beyond my comprehension: and perhaps for us, who have understandings and comprehensions suited to our own preservation, and the ends of our own being, but not to the reality and extent of all other beings, it is near as hard to conceive any existence, or to have an idea of any real being, with a perfect negation of all manner of expansion, as it is to have the idea of any real existence with a perfect negation of all manner of duration. And therefore, what spirits have to do with space, or how they communicate in it, we know not. All that we know is, that bodies do each singly possess its proper portion of it, according to the extent of solid parts; and thereby exclude all other bodies from having any share in that particular portion of space, whilst it remains there.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但它们之间有一个明显的区别，那就是我们对长度的概念，即扩张的概念，是以各种方式转动的，因此会产生数字、广度和厚度；但持续时间只是一条直线的长度，无限延伸，不可能有多重性、变化或数字；而是所有存在的一个共同尺度，所有事物在其存在时，都平等地参与其中。因为这个时刻是所有现在存在的事物所共有的，同样包含了它们存在的那一部分，就像它们都是一个单一的存在一样；我们可以真正地说，它们都存在于同一个时间时刻。在扩展方面，天使和精神是否有任何类似的东西，我无法理解：也许对我们来说，我们的理解和理解力适合于我们自己的保存和我们自己存在的目的，但不适合所有其他生命的现实和程度，在完全否定所有方式的扩展的情况下，几乎很难想象任何存在，或对任何真实存在的想法，就像在完全否定所有方式的持续时间的情况下对任何真实存在的想法一样。因此，我们不知道精神与空间有什么关系，也不知道它们如何在其中交流。我们所知道的是，根据固体部分的范围，身体单独拥有它的适当部分；从而排除所有其他身体在空间的特定部分的任何份额，而它仍然在那里。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">DURATION, and TIME which is a part of it, is the idea we have of PERISHING distance, of which no two parts exist together, but follow each other in succession; an EXPANSION is the idea of LASTING distance, all whose parts exist together and are not capable of succession. And therefore, though we cannot conceive any duration without succession, nor can put it together in our thoughts that any being does NOW exist to-morrow, or possess at once more than the present moment of duration; yet we can conceive the eternal duration of the Almighty far different from that of man, or any other finite being. Because man comprehends not in his knowledge or power all past and future things: his thoughts are but of yesterday, and he knows not what to-morrow will bring forth. What is once past he can never recall; and what is yet to come he cannot make present. What I say of man, I say of all finite beings; who, though they may far exceed man in knowledge and power, yet are no more than the meanest creature, in comparison with God himself. Finite or any magnitude holds not any proportion to infinite. God’s infinite duration, being accompanied with infinite knowledge and infinite power, he sees all things, past and to come; and they are no more distant from his knowledge, no further removed from his sight, than the present: they all lie under the same view: and there is nothing which he cannot make exist each moment he pleases. For the existence of all things, depending upon his good pleasure, all things exist every moment that he thinks fit to have them exist. To conclude: expansion and duration do mutually embrace and comprehend each other; every part of space being in every part of duration, and every part of duration in every part of expansion. Such a combination of two distinct ideas is, I suppose, scarce to be found in all that great variety we do or can conceive, and may afford matter to further speculation.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">寿命，以及作为其一部分的时间，是我们所拥有的永恒的距离的概念，其中没有两个部分同时存在，而是彼此相继；扩展是持久的距离的概念，其所有部分同时存在，不可能相继。因此，尽管我们无法想象任何没有连续的持续时间，也无法在我们的思想中拼凑出任何生命现在存在于明天，或一下子拥有比现在更多的持续时间；但我们可以想象全能者的永恒持续时间与人类或任何其他有限生命的持续时间大不相同。因为人的知识和能力无法理解所有过去和未来的事物：他的思想只是昨天的，他不知道明天会发生什么。过去的事，他永远无法回忆；未来的事，他无法呈现。我所说的人，也是指所有的有限生命；他们虽然在知识和能力上远远超过人，但与上帝本身相比，也不过是最卑微的生物。有限的或任何程度都与无限的不相称。上帝的无限期，伴随着无限的知识和无限的能力，他看到了所有的事物，过去的和未来的；它们与他的知识没有更多的距离，与他的视线没有更多的距离，它们都在同一个视线之下：没有什么东西是他不能在他喜欢的每一刻使之存在的。因为所有事物的存在都取决于他的善意，所有事物在他认为合适的时刻都存在。总结：扩张和持续时间确实相互包容，相互理解；空间的每一部分都在持续时间的每一部分中，持续时间的每一部分也在扩张的每一部分中。我想，两个不同概念的这种结合，在我们所做的或所能想象的所有巨大的变化中是很少见的，而且可能提供了进一步推测的问题。</p>

Because the ideas of numbers are more precise and distinguishable than in extension; where every equality and excess are not so easy to be observed or measured; because our thoughts cannot in space arrive at any determined smallness beyond which it cannot go, as an unit; and therefore the quantity or proportion of any the least excess cannot be discovered; which is clear otherwise in number, where, as has been said, 91 is as distinguishable from 90 as from 9000, though 91 be the next immediate excess to 90. But it is not so in extension, where, whatsoever is more than just a foot or an inch, is not distinguishable from the standard of a foot or an inch; and in lines which appear of an equal length, one may be longer than the other by innumerable parts: nor can any one assign an angle, which shall be the next biggest to a right one.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">By the repeating, as has been said, the idea of an unit, and joining it to another unit, we make thereof one collective idea, marked by the name two. And whosoever can do this, and proceed on, still adding one more to the last collective idea which he had of any number, and gave a name to it, may count, or have ideas, for several collections of units, distinguished one from another, as far as he hath a series of names for following numbers, and a memory to retain that series, with their several names: all numeration being but still the adding of one unit more, and giving to the whole together, as comprehended in one idea, a new or distinct name or sign, whereby to know it from those before and after, and distinguish it from every smaller or greater multitude of units. So that he that can add one to one, and so to two, and so go on with his tale, taking still with him the distinct names belonging to every progression; and so again, by subtracting an unit from each collection, retreat and lessen them, is capable of all the ideas of numbers within the compass of his language, or for which he hath names, though not perhaps of more. For, the several simple modes of numbers being in our minds but so many combinations of units, which have no variety, nor are capable of any other difference but more or less, names or marks for each distinct combination seem more necessary than in any other sort of ideas. For, without such names or marks, we can hardly well make use of numbers in reckoning, especially where the combination is made up of any great multitude of units; which put together, without a name or mark to distinguish that precise collection, will hardly be kept from being a heap in confusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">如前所述，通过重复一个单位的概念，并将其与另一个单位结合起来，我们就会使其成为一个集体的概念，并以二为名。谁能做到这一点，并继续下去，在他对任何数字的最后一个集体概念上再加一个，并给它起个名字，谁就可以计算，或对几个单位的集合有想法，一个比一个有区别，只要他对后面的数字有一系列的名字，并有记忆来保留这个系列，以及它们的几个名字。所有的数字都是增加一个单位，并给包含在一个概念中的整体赋予一个新的或独特的名称或符号，从而将其与之前和之后的数字区分开来，并将其与每一个较小或较大的单位区分开来。因此，他能把一加到一，再加到二，如此继续他的故事，并带着属于每个进展的独特名称；同样，通过从每个集合中减去一个单位，缩小和减少它们，就能在他的语言范围内，或在他有名称的情况下，掌握所有的数的概念，尽管可能没有更多。因为，在我们的头脑中，数的几种简单模式不过是许多单位的组合，它们没有种类，也不可能有任何其他的区别，只是多一点或少一点，为每一种不同的组合命名或标记似乎比任何其他种类的概念更有必要。因为，如果没有这样的名字或标记，我们就很难在计算中使用数字，特别是当组合是由任何大量的单位组成的时候；这些组合在一起，如果没有一个名字或标记来区分这个精确的集合，就很难避免成为一堆混乱的东西。</p>

Because their language being scanty, and accommodated only to the few necessaries of a needy, simple life, unacquainted either with trade or mathematics, had no words in it to stand for 1000; so that when they were discoursed with of those greater numbers, they would show the hairs of their head, to express a great multitude, which they could not number; which inability, I suppose, proceeded from their want of names. The Tououpinambos had no names for numbers above 5; any number beyond that they made out by showing their fingers, and the fingers of others who were present. And I doubt not but we ourselves might distinctly number in words a great deal further than we usually do, would we find out but some fit denominations to signify them by; whereas, in the way we take now to name them, by millions of millions of millions, &amp;c., it is hard to go beyond eighteen, or at most, four and twenty, decimal progressions, without confusion. But to show how much distinct names conduce to our well reckoning, or having useful ideas of numbers, let us see all these following figures in one continued line, as the marks of one number: v. g.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为这就是为什么我所接触过的一些美国人（他们在其他方面足够敏捷和理性）不能像我们一样数到1000；也没有任何关于这个数字的明确概念，尽管他们可以很好地计算到20。因为他们的语言贫乏，只适应于贫困、简单生活的少数必需品，既不懂贸易，也不懂数学，所以他们的语言中没有代表1000的词；所以当他们被问及那些更大的数字时，他们会露出头来，以表示他们无法计算的巨大数量；我想，这种无能是由于他们没有名字。Tououpinambos人对5以上的数字没有名字；任何超过这个数字的数字，他们都是通过展示自己的手指和其他在场的人的手指来表示的。我不怀疑，如果我们能找到一些合适的名称来表示它们，我们自己就能清楚地用文字说出比我们通常所做的更多的数字；而按照我们现在所采取的命名方式，用几百万几千万等等来命名，很难超过十八个，或者最多四个和二十个，小数的递增，而不至于混乱不堪。但为了说明不同的名称对我们的计算有多大的帮助，或者说对数字有多大的帮助，让我们把下面这些数字放在一条直线上，作为一个数字的标志：V.

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus children, either for want of names to mark the several progressions of numbers, or not having yet the faculty to collect scattered ideas into complex ones, and range them in a regular order, and so retain them in their memories, as is necessary to reckoning, do not begin to number very early, nor proceed in it very far or steadily, till a good while after they are well furnished with good store of other ideas: and one may often observe them discourse and reason pretty well, and have very clear conceptions of several other things, before they can tell twenty. And some, through the default of their memories, who cannot retain the several combinations of numbers, with their names, annexed in their distinct orders, and the dependence of so long a train of numeral progressions, and their relation one to another, are not able all their lifetime to reckon, or regularly go over any moderate series of numbers. For he that will count twenty, or have any idea of that number, must know that nineteen went before, with the distinct name or sign of every one of them, as they stand marked in their order; for wherever this fails, a gap is made, the chain breaks, and the progress in numbering can go no further. So that to reckon right, it is required, (1) That the mind distinguish carefully two ideas, which are different one from another only by the addition or subtraction of ONE unit: (2) That it retain in memory the names or marks of the several combinations, from an unit to that number; and that not confusedly, and at random, but in that exact order that the numbers follow one another. In either of which, if it trips, the whole business of numbering will be disturbed, and there will remain only the confused idea of multitude, but the ideas necessary to distinct numeration will not be attained to.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，孩子们，要么是由于没有名字来标记数字的几个进展，要么是还没有能力将零散的想法收集成复杂的想法，并将它们按规则的顺序排列，并将它们保留在他们的记忆中，这是计算所必需的，他们不会很早就开始计算，也不会在这方面进行得很远或很稳定，直到他们有了很好的其他想法之后。有些人，由于他们的记忆力不足，不能保留数字的几种组合，以及它们的名字，并按它们的不同顺序排列，以及这么长的数字递增的依赖性，以及它们之间的关系，终其一生都不能计算，或有规律地复习任何适度的数字系列。因为要数二十个数字，或者对这个数字有任何想法的人，必须知道前面有十九个数字，并知道每一个数字的明确名称或符号，因为它们都按顺序标出；因为只要这一点做不到，就会出现漏洞，链条就会断裂，数字的进展就无法继续。因此，要想计算正确，就需要：（1）头脑要仔细区分两个概念，它们之间的区别只在于一个单位的加减。(2）在记忆中保留几个组合的名称或标记，从一个单位到那个数字；而且不是混乱地和随意地，而是按照数字之间的确切顺序。无论哪种情况，如果它失败了，整个编号工作就会受到干扰，只剩下混乱的数字概念，而独特的编号所需的概念则无法达到。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This further is observable in number, that it is that which the mind makes use of in measuring all things that by us are measurable, which principally are EXPANSION and DURATION; and our idea of infinity, even when applied to those, seems to be nothing but the infinity of number. For what else are our ideas of Eternity and Immensity, but the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion, with the infinity of number; in which we can come to no end of addition? For such an inexhaustible stock, number (of all other our ideas) most clearly furnishes us with, as is obvious to every one. For let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases, this multitude how great soever, lessens not one jot the power of adding to it, or brings him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number; where still there remains as much to be added, as if none were taken out. And this ENDLESS ADDITION or ADDIBILITY (if any one like the word better) of numbers, so apparent to the mind, is that, I think, which gives us the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity: of which more in the following chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这一点在数字中也是可以观察到的，它是心灵用来测量所有我们可以测量的东西的，这些东西主要是扩展和时间；而我们的无限概念，即使应用于这些，似乎也只是数字的无限性。因为我们关于永恒和无量的观念，除了是对某些想象中的持续时间和扩展部分的反复添加，以及对数的无限性的添加之外，还有什么是我们的观念？对于这样一个取之不尽、用之不竭的存量，数（在我们所有其他观念中）为我们提供了最明显的条件，这对每个人来说都是显而易见的。因为让一个人随心所欲地把大量的数字汇集成一个总和，无论这个数字有多大，都不会削弱他的加法能力，也不会使他更接近数字这个取之不尽、用之不竭的存量的终点；在这里，仍然有很多东西可以添加，就像没有任何东西被取出来一样。数字的这种无止境的增加或可增加性（如果有人更喜欢这个词的话），在头脑中是如此明显，我认为它给了我们关于无限的最清晰和最明确的概念：关于这一点，在下一章会有更多介绍。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">FINITE and INFINITE seem to me to be looked upon by the mind as the MODES OF QUANTITY, and to be attributed primarily in their first designation only to those things which have parts, and are capable of increase or diminution by the addition or subtraction of any the least part: and such are the ideas of space, duration, and number, which we have considered in the foregoing chapters. It is true, that we cannot but be assured, that the great God, of whom and from whom are all things, is incomprehensibly infinite: but yet, when we apply to that first and supreme Being our idea of infinite, in our weak and narrow thoughts, we do it primarily in respect to his duration and ubiquity; and, I think, more figuratively to his power, wisdom, and goodness, and other attributes which are properly inexhaustible and incomprehensible, &amp;c. For, when we call THEM infinite, we have no other idea of this infinity but what carries with it some reflection on, and imitation of, that number or extent of the acts or objects of God’s power, wisdom, and goodness, which can never be supposed so great, or so many, which these attributes will not always surmount and exceed, let us multiply them in our thoughts as far as we can, with all the infinity of endless number. I do not pretend to say how these attributes are in God, who is infinitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities: they do, without doubt, contain in them all possible perfection: but this, I say, is our way of conceiving them, and these our ideas of their infinity.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我看来，"有限 "和 "无限 "似乎被认为是数量的模式，并且在它们的第一个名称中只归属于那些有部分的事物，并且能够通过增加或减少任何最小的部分来增加或减少：这就是我们在前几章中所考虑的空间、时间和数量的概念。诚然，我们不能不确信，伟大的上帝（万物皆由他而来）是不可理解的无限的：但是，当我们把我们的无限概念应用于这位第一和最高的存在时，在我们软弱和狭隘的思想中，我们主要是针对他的持续时间和无处不在；而且，我认为更形象的是针对他的权力、智慧和仁慈，以及其他适当的取之不尽和不可理解的属性，等等。因为，当我们称它们为无限时，我们对这种无限没有别的想法，只是对上帝的权力、智慧和仁慈的行为或对象的数量或范围进行了一些思考和模仿，这些属性永远不会被认为如此之大，或如此之多，这些属性不会总是超越和超过，让我们在思想中尽可能地把它们乘以无尽的数量。我并不打算说这些属性在上帝身上是怎样的，他是无限地超出了我们狭隘的能力范围：毫无疑问，它们确实包含了所有可能的完美：但是，我说，这是我们构想它们的方式，这些是我们对它们的无限性的想法。</p>

The obvious portions of extension that affect our senses, carry with them into the mind the idea of finite: and the ordinary periods of succession, whereby we measure time and duration, as hours, days, and years, are bounded lengths. The difficulty is, how we come by those BOUNDLESS IDEAS of eternity and immensity; since the objects we converse with come so much short of any approach or proportion to that largeness.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This, I think, is the way whereby the mind gets the IDEA of infinite space. It is a quite different consideration, to examine whether the mind has the idea of such a boundless space ACTUALLY EXISTING; since our ideas are not always proofs of the existence of things: but yet, since this comes here in our way, I suppose I may say, that we are APT TO THINK that space in itself is actually boundless, to which imagination the idea of space or expansion of itself naturally leads us. For, it being considered by us, either as the extension of body, or as existing by itself, without any solid matter taking it up, (for of such a void space we have not only the idea, but I have proved, as I think, from the motion of body, its necessary existence,) it is impossible the mind should be ever able to find or suppose any end of it, or be stopped anywhere in its progress in this space, how far soever it extends its thoughts. Any bounds made with body, even adamantine walls, are so far from putting a stop to the mind in its further progress in space and extension that it rather facilitates and enlarges it. For so far as that body reaches, so far no one can doubt of extension; and when we are come to the utmost extremity of body, what is there that can there put a stop, and satisfy the mind that it is at the end of space, when it perceives that it is not; nay, when it is satisfied that body itself can move into it? For, if it be necessary for the motion of body, that there should be an empty space, though ever so little, here amongst bodies; and if it be possible for body to move in or through that empty space;—nay, it is impossible for any particle of matter to move but into an empty space; the same possibility of a body’s moving into a void space, beyond the utmost bounds of body, as well as into a void space interspersed amongst bodies, will always remain clear and evident: the idea of empty pure space, whether within or beyond the confines of all bodies, being exactly the same, differing not in nature, though in bulk; and there being nothing to hinder body from moving into it. So that wherever the mind places itself by any thought, either amongst, or remote from all bodies, it can, in this uniform idea of space, nowhere find any bounds, any end; and so must necessarily conclude it, by the very nature and idea of each part of it, to be actually infinite.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为，这就是心灵获得无限空间的理念的方式。这是一个完全不同的考虑，以检查心灵是否有这样一个无边的空间的想法实际存在；因为我们的想法并不总是证明事物的存在：但是，既然这在我们这里出现了，我想我可以说，我们被迫认为空间本身实际上是无边的，对空间的想象或其本身的扩张自然导致我们。因为，我们把它看作是身体的延伸，或者看作是它本身的存在，没有任何固体物质占据它，（因为对于这样一个虚无的空间，我们不仅有想法，而且我已经证明，正如我认为的那样，从身体的运动中，它必然存在，）思想不可能找到或假设它的任何终点，或者在它在这个空间的任何地方停止前进，无论它把思想延伸到多远。任何用身体制造的界限，甚至是金刚墙，都远远不能阻止思想在空间和延伸方面的进一步发展，反而会促进和扩大它。因为身体到达的范围有多大，延伸的范围就有多大，没有人可以怀疑；当我们走到身体的极致时，有什么东西可以阻止它，使心灵确信它已经到了空间的尽头，而它却认为它不是；不，当它确信身体本身可以进入空间时，还有什么东西可以阻止它？因为，如果身体的运动需要有一个空的空间，尽管是那么小，在身体之间；如果身体有可能在那个空的空间里或通过那个空的空间运动；不，任何物质的粒子除了进入一个空的空间外不可能运动；一个身体有可能进入一个空的空间，超出身体的最大界限，以及进入一个穿插在身体之间的空的空间，这一点将始终是清楚和明显的。空旷的纯空间的概念，无论是在所有身体的范围内还是在所有身体的范围外，都是完全一样的，虽然在体积上没有性质上的差异；没有任何东西可以阻碍身体移动到它。因此，无论心灵通过任何思想把自己放在哪里，无论是在所有身体中，还是在远离所有身体的地方，它都可以在这个统一的空间概念中，在任何地方找到任何界限，任何终点；因此，根据它的每一部分的性质和想法，必然得出结论，它实际上是无限的。</p>

For we find in ourselves, we can no more come to an end of such repeated ideas than we can come to the end of number; which every one perceives he cannot. But here again it is another question, quite different from our having an IDEA of eternity, to know whether there were ANY REAL BEING, whose duration has been eternal.

		<p class="calibre5 en">If it be so, that our idea of infinity be got from the power we observe in ourselves of repeating, without end, our own ideas, it may be demanded,—Why we do not attribute infinity to other ideas, as well as those of space and duration; since they may be as easily, and as often, repeated in our minds as the other: and yet nobody ever thinks of infinite sweetness or infinite whiteness, though he can repeat the idea of sweet or white, as frequently as those of a yard or a day? To which I answer,—All the ideas that are considered as having parts, and are capable of increase by the addition of an equal or less parts, afford us, by their repetition, the idea of infinity; because, with this endless repetition, there is continued an enlargement of which there CAN be no end. But for other ideas it is not so. For to the largest idea of extension or duration that I at present have, the addition of any the least part makes an increase; but to the perfectest idea I have of the whitest whiteness, if I add another of a less equal whiteness, (and of a whiter than I have, I cannot add the idea,) it makes no increase, and enlarges not my idea at all; and therefore the different ideas of whiteness, &amp;c. are called degrees. For those ideas that consist of part are capable of being augmented by every addition of the least part; but if you take the idea of white, which one parcel of snow yielded yesterday to our sight, and another idea of white from another parcel of snow you see to-day, and put them together in your mind, they embody, as it were, all run into one, and the idea of whiteness is not at all increased and if we add a less degree of whiteness to a greater, we are so far from increasing, that we diminish it. Those ideas that consist not of parts cannot be augmented to what proportion men please, or be stretched beyond what they have received by their senses; but space, duration, and number, being capable of increase by repetition, leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more; nor can we conceive anywhere a stop to a further addition or progression: and so those ideas ALONE lead our minds towards the thought of infinity.</p>

For, as our idea of infinity being, as I think, AN ENDLESS GROWING IDEA, but the idea of any quantity the mind has, being at that time TERMINATED in that idea, (for be it as great as it will, it can be no greater than it is,)—to join infinity to it, is to adjust a standing measure to a growing bulk; and therefore I think it is not an insignificant subtilty, if I say, that we are carefully to distinguish between the idea of the infinity of space, and the idea of a space infinite. The first is nothing but a supposed endless progression of the mind, over what repeated ideas of space it pleases; but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space infinite, is to suppose the mind already passed over, and actually to have a view of ALL those repeated ideas of space which an ENDLESS repetition can never totally represent to it; which carries in it a plain contradiction.</p>

The infinity of numbers, to the end of whose addition every one perceives there is no approach, easily appears to any one that reflects on it. But, how clear soever this idea of the infinity of number be, there is nothing yet more evident than the absurdity of the actual idea of an infinite number. Whatsoever POSITIVE ideas we have in our minds of any space, duration, or number, let them be ever so great, they are still finite; but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder, from which we remove all bounds, and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of thought, without ever completing the idea, there we have our idea of infinity: which, though it seems to be pretty clear when we consider nothing else in it but the negation of an end, yet, when we would frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration, that idea is very obscure and confused, because it is made up of two parts, very different, if not inconsistent. For, let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number, as great as he will; it is plain the mind RESTS AND TERMINATES in that idea, which is contrary to the idea of infinity, which CONSISTS IN A SUPPOSED ENDLESS PROGRESSION. And therefore I think it is that we are so easily confounded, when we come to argue and reason about infinite space or duration, &amp;c. Because the parts of such an idea not being perceived to be, as they are, inconsistent, the one side or other always perplexes, whatever consequences we draw from the other; as an idea of motion not passing on would perplex any one who should argue from such an idea, which is not better than an idea of motion at rest. And such another seems to me to be the idea of a space, or (which is the same thing) a number infinite, i. e. of a space or number which the mind actually has, and so views and terminates in; and of a space or number, which, in a constant and endless enlarging and progression, it can in thought never attain to. For, how large soever an idea of space I have in my mind, it is no larger than it is that instant that I have it, though I be capable the next instant to double it, and so on in infinitum; for that alone is infinite which has no bounds; and that the idea of infinity, in which our thoughts can find none.</p>

But in space and duration it is otherwise. For in duration we consider it as if this line of number were extended BOTH ways—to an unconceivable, undeterminate, and infinite length; which is evident to anyone that will but reflect on what consideration he hath of Eternity; which, I suppose, will find to be nothing else but the turning this infinity of number both ways, a parte ante and a parte post, as they speak. For, when we would consider eternity, a parte ante, what do we but, beginning from ourselves and the present time we are in, repeat in our minds ideas of years, or ages, or any other assignable portion of duration past, with a prospect of proceeding in such addition with all the infinity of number: and when we would consider eternity, a parte post, we just after the same rate begin from ourselves, and reckon by multiplied periods yet to come, still extending that line of number as before.

We can, I think, have no positive idea of any space or duration which is not made up of, and commensurate to, repeated numbers of feet or yards, or days and years; which are the common measures, whereof we have the ideas in our minds, and whereby we judge of the greatness of this sort of quantities. And therefore, since an infinite idea of space or duration must needs be made up of infinite parts, it can have no other infinity than that of number CAPABLE still of further addition; but not an actual positive idea of a number infinite. For, I think it is evident, that the addition of finite things together (as are all lengths whereof we have the positive ideas) can never otherwise produce the idea of infinite than as number does; which consisting of additions of finite units one to another, suggests the idea of infinite, only by a power we find we have of still increasing the sum, and adding more of the same kind; without coming one jot nearer the end of such progression.</p>

He that considers that the end is, in body, but the extremity or superficies of that body, will not perhaps be forward to grant that the end is a bare negative: and he that perceives the end of his pen is black or white, will be apt to think that the end is something more than a pure negation. Nor is it, when applied to duration, the bare negation of existence, but more properly the last moment of it. But as they will have the end to be nothing but the bare negation of existence, I am sure they cannot deny but the beginning of the first instant of being, and is not by any body conceived to be a bare negation; and therefore, by their own argument, the idea of eternal, A PARTE ANTE, or of a duration without a beginning, is but a negative idea.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The idea of infinite has, I confess, something of positive in all those things we apply to it. When we would think of infinite space or duration, we at first step usually make some very large idea, as perhaps of millions of ages, or miles, which possibly we double and multiply several times. All that we thus amass together in our thoughts is positive, and the assemblage of a great number of positive ideas of space or duration. But what still remains beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner has of the depth of the sea; where, having let down a large portion of his sounding-line, he reaches no bottom. Whereby he knows the depth to be so many fathoms, and more; but how much the more is, he hath no distinct notion at all: and could he always supply new line, and find the plummet always sink, without ever stopping, he would be something in the posture of the mind reaching after a complete and positive idea of infinity. In which case, let this line be ten, or ten thousand fathoms long, it equally discovers what is beyond it, and gives only this confused and comparative idea, that this is not all, but one may yet go farther. So much as the mind comprehends of any space, it has a positive idea of: but in endeavouring to make it infinite,—it being always enlarging, always advancing,—the idea is still imperfect and incomplete. So much space as the mind takes a view of in its contemplation of greatness, is a clear picture, and positive in the understanding: but infinite is still greater. 1. Then the idea of SO MUCH is positive and clear. 2. The idea of GREATER is also clear; but it is but a comparative idea, the idea of SO MUCH GREATER AS CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED. 3. And this is plainly negative: not positive. For he has no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension, (which is that sought for in the idea of infinite), that has not a comprehensive idea of the dimensions of it: and such, nobody, I think, pretends to in what is infinite. For to say a man has a positive clear idea of any quantity, without knowing how great it is, is as reasonable as to say, he has the positive clear idea of the number of the sands on the sea-shore, who knows not how many there be, but only that they are more than twenty. For just such a perfect and positive idea has he of an infinite space or duration, who says it is LARGER THAN the extent or duration of ten, one hundred, one thousand, or any other number of miles, or years, whereof he has or can have a positive idea; which is all the idea, I think, we have of infinite. So that what lies beyond our positive idea TOWARDS infinity, lies in obscurity, and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea, wherein I know I neither do nor can comprehend all I would, it being too large for a finite and narrow capacity. And that cannot but be very far from a positive complete idea, wherein the greatest part of what I would comprehend is left out, under the undeterminate intimation of being still greater. For to say, that, having in any quantity measured so much, or gone so far, you are not yet at the end, is only to say that that quantity is greater. So that the negation of an end in any quantity is, in other words, only to say that it is bigger; and a total negation of an end is but carrying this bigger still with you, in all the progressions your thoughts shall make in quantity; and adding this IDEA OF STILL GREATER to ALL the ideas you have, or can be supposed to have, of quantity. Now, whether such an idea as that be positive, I leave any one to consider.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我承认，"无限 "这个概念在我们应用于它的所有事物中都有一些积极意义。当我们想到无限的空间或持续时间时，我们第一步通常会产生一些非常大的想法，也许是几百万年的时间，或者是几英里，可能我们会把这些想法翻倍并乘以几倍。我们这样在我们的思想中聚集起来的所有东西都是积极的，是大量积极的空间或时间概念的集合。但是，在这之外，我们仍然没有一个积极明确的概念，就像一个水手对大海的深度一样；在那里，他放下了大部分的探测线，却没有到达底部。因此，他知道深度有这么多，甚至更多；但更多的是，他根本没有明确的概念：如果他总是提供新的线，并发现梅花总是下沉，没有停止过，他就会在头脑中形成一个完整和积极的无限概念的姿势。在这种情况下，如果这条线有十英尺或一万英尺长，它同样会发现它以外的东西，而只给出这种混乱和比较的想法，即这不是全部，但人们还可以走得更远。心灵所理解的任何空间，它都有一个积极的概念：但在努力使它成为无限的时候，它总是在扩大，总是在前进，这个概念仍然是不完善和不完整的。心灵在对伟大的沉思中所看到的空间，是一幅清晰的图画，在理解中是积极的：但无限的空间仍然更大。1.那么，"如此之多 "的概念是积极和清晰的。2.2. 更大的概念也是清楚的；但它只是一个比较性的概念，即 "如此之大 "的概念是无法比拟的。3.这显然是消极的，而不是积极的。因为他对任何延伸的大小都没有积极的明确概念，（这是在无限的概念中所寻求的），他对它的尺寸没有一个全面的概念：我认为，没有人在无限的东西中假装这样。因为说一个人对任何数量都有明确的概念，但不知道它有多大，这就像说他对海边的沙子数量有明确的概念，但不知道有多少，只知道它们超过了20。因为他对无限的空间或持续时间也有这样一个完美和积极的想法，他说它比他有或能有积极想法的十、一百、一千或任何其他数量的英里或年的范围或持续时间都要大；我想，这就是我们对无限的所有想法。因此，在我们的积极想法之外，向着无限的方向的东西，是模糊的，具有消极想法的不确定的混乱，在那里我知道我既不做也不能理解我想要的一切，它对于有限和狭窄的能力来说太大。而这不能不说与一个积极的完整概念相去甚远，在这个概念中，我所要理解的东西的最大部分被遗漏了，在不确定的暗示下，它还会更大。因为如果说，在任何数量上测量了这么多，或走了这么远，你还没有到达终点，那就只能说这个数量更大。因此，对任何数量的终点的否定，换句话说，只是说它更大了；而对终点的完全否定，只是在你的思想在数量上的所有进展中，仍然带着这个更大的东西；并把这个 "仍然更大 "的想法加入到你对数量的所有想法中，或者可以被认为是对数量的想法中。现在，这样的想法是否是积极的，我让任何人来考虑。</p>

If it does not, they ought to show the difference of their notion of duration, when applied to an eternal Being, and to a finite; since, perhaps, there may be others as well as I, who will own to them their weakness of understanding in this point, and acknowledge that the notion they have of duration forces them to conceive, that whatever has duration, is of a longer continuance to-day than it was yesterday. If, to avoid succession in external existence, they return to the punctum stans of the schools, I suppose they will thereby very little mend the matter, or help us to a more clear and positive idea of infinite duration; there being nothing more inconceivable to me than duration without succession. Besides, that punctum stans, if it signify anything, being not quantum, finite or infinite cannot belong to it. But, if our weak apprehensions cannot separate succession from any duration whatsoever, our idea of eternity can be nothing but of INFINITE SUCCESSION OF MOMENTS OF DURATION WHEREIN ANYTHING DOES EXIST; and whether any one has, or can have, a positive idea of an actual infinite number, I leave him to consider, till his infinite number be so great that he himself can add no more to it; and as long as he can increase it, I doubt he himself will think the idea he hath of it a little too scanty for positive infinity.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我问那些说他们对永恒有积极看法的人，他们对持续时间的看法是否包括继承？如果不包括，他们应该说明他们的持续时间概念在应用于永恒的存在和有限的存在时有什么不同；因为，也许有其他人和我一样，会向他们承认他们在这一点上理解力的弱点，并承认他们的持续时间概念迫使他们设想，凡是有持续时间的东西，今天的持续时间比昨天的要长。如果为了避免外部存在的连续性，他们回到学校的punctum stans，我想他们这样做几乎不能弥补这个问题，也不能帮助我们对无限的持续时间有一个更清晰和积极的概念；对我来说，没有什么比没有连续的持续时间更难以想象。此外，如果punctum stans表示什么，它不是量子，有限或无限都不属于它。但是，如果我们软弱的理解力不能从任何持续时间中分离出来，那么我们对永恒的概念就只能是任何东西都存在的无限的持续时间的片段。是否有人对实际的无限数有或能有积极的想法，我让他自己考虑，直到他的无限数大到他自己不能再增加；只要他能增加，我怀疑他自己会认为他对它的想法对积极的无限数来说有点太少。</p>

For in this latter, which seems the easier of the two, and more within our comprehension, we are capable only of a comparative idea of smallness, which will always be less than any one whereof we have the positive idea. All our POSITIVE ideas of any quantity, whether great or little, have always bounds, though our COMPARATIVE idea, whereby we can always add to the one, and take from the other, hath no bounds. For that which remains, either great or little, not being comprehended in that positive idea which we have, lies in obscurity; and we have no other idea of it, but of the power of enlarging the one and diminishing the other, WITHOUT CEASING. A pestle and mortar will as soon bring any particle of matter to indivisibility, as the acutest thought of a mathematician; and a surveyor may as soon with his chain measure out infinite space, as a philosopher by the quickest flight of mind reach it or by thinking comprehend it; which is to have a positive idea of it. He that thinks on a cube of an inch diameter, has a clear and positive idea of it in his mind, and so can frame one of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on, till he has the idea in his thoughts of something very little; but yet reaches not the idea of that incomprehensible littleness which division can produce.

The reason of which mistake I suppose to be this—that finding, by a due contemplation of causes and effects, that it is necessary to admit some Eternal Being, and so to consider the real existence of that Being as taken up and commensurate to their idea of eternity; but, on the other side, not finding it necessary, but, on the contrary, apparently absurd, that body should be infinite, they forwardly conclude that they can have no idea of infinite space, because they can have no idea of infinite matter. Which consequence, I conceive, is very ill collected, because the existence of matter is no ways necessary to the existence of space, no more than the existence of motion, or the sun, is necessary to duration, though duration uses to be measured by it. And I doubt not but that a man may have the idea of ten thousand miles square, without any body so big, as well as the idea of ten thousand years, without any body so old. It seems as easy to me to have the idea of space empty of body, as to think of the capacity of a bushel without corn, or the hollow of a nut-shell without a kernel in it: it being no more necessary that there should be existing a solid body, infinitely extended, because we have an idea of the infinity of space, than it is necessary that the world should be eternal, because we have an idea of infinite duration. And why should we think our idea of infinite space requires the real existence of matter to support it, when we find that we have as clear an idea of an infinite duration to come, as we have of infinite duration past? Though I suppose nobody thinks it conceivable that anything does or has existed in that future duration. Nor is it possible to join our idea of future duration with present or past existence, any more than it is possible to make the ideas of yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow to be the same; or bring ages past and future together, and make them contemporary. But if these men are of the mind, that they have clearer ideas of infinite duration than of infinite space, because it is past doubt that God has existed from all eternity, but there is no real matter co-extended with infinite space; yet those philosophers who are of opinion that infinite space is possessed by God’s infinite omnipresence, as well as infinite duration by his eternal existence, must be allowed to have as clear an idea of infinite space as of infinite duration; though neither of them, I think, has any positive idea of infinity in either case. For whatsoever positive ideas a man has in his mind of any quantity, he can repeat it, and add it to the former, as easy as he can add together the ideas of two days, or two paces, which are positive ideas of lengths he has in his mind, and so on as long as he pleases: whereby, if a man had a positive idea of infinite, either duration or space, he could add two infinites together; nay, make one infinite infinitely bigger than another—absurdities too gross to be confuted.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我遇到过一些人，他们把无限的时间和无限的空间相提并论，以至于他们说服自己，说他们对永恒有一种积极的想法，但他们没有，也不可能有任何关于无限空间的想法。我认为这种错误的原因是：通过对因果关系的适当思考，发现有必要承认某种永恒的存在，因此认为这种存在的实际存在与他们的永恒观念是相称的；但是，在另一方面，他们认为身体应该是无限的，这不是必要的，相反，显然是荒谬的，他们预先得出结论，他们不可能有无限空间的观念，因为他们不可能有无限的物质的观念。我认为，这个结论是很不妥当的，因为物质的存在对空间的存在没有任何必要，就像运动或太阳的存在对时间的存在是必要的一样，尽管时间是用它来衡量的。我不怀疑，一个人可以有一万英里方圆的想法，而没有任何身体这么大，也可以有一万年的想法，而没有任何身体这么老。在我看来，要想有一个没有身体的空间概念，就像想一个没有玉米的蒲团的容量，或者一个没有果核的坚果壳的空洞一样容易：因为我们有一个空间无限的概念，所以没有必要存在一个无限延伸的实体，就像因为我们有一个无限的时间概念，所以世界应该是永恒的。当我们发现我们对即将到来的无限时间的想法和我们对过去的无限时间的想法一样清楚时，我们为什么要认为我们的无限空间的想法需要物质的真实存在来支持它呢？尽管我想没有人认为在未来的时间里有任何东西存在或已经存在是可以想象的。也不可能把我们对未来期限的想法与现在或过去的存在结合起来，就像把昨天、今天和明天的想法变成一样；或者把过去和未来的时代结合起来，使它们成为当代人。但是，如果这些人认为，他们对无限的时间比无限的空间有更清楚的概念，因为上帝从所有的永恒中存在是毋庸置疑的，但没有真正的物质与无限的空间共同延伸。然而，那些认为无限空间是由上帝的无限无所不在所拥有的，以及无限时间是由他的永恒存在所拥有的哲学家们，必须被允许对无限空间和无限时间有同样清晰的概念；尽管我认为他们中的任何一个人都没有任何关于无限的积极概念。因为无论一个人在他的头脑中对任何数量有什么积极的想法，他都可以重复它，并把它加到前一个数量上，就像他可以把两天或两步的想法加在一起一样容易，这是他头脑中对长度的积极想法，只要他愿意就可以这样做：因此，如果一个人对无限有积极的想法，无论是持续时间还是空间，他可以把两个无限加在一起；不，使一个无限比另一个无限大，这些荒谬之处无法被驳倒。</p>

For I have been hitherto apt to think that the great and inextricable difficulties which perpetually involve all discourses concerning infinity,—whether of space, duration, or divisibility, have been the certain marks of a defect in our ideas of infinity, and the disproportion the nature thereof has to the comprehension of our narrow capacities. For, whilst men talk and dispute of infinite space or duration, as if they had as complete and positive ideas of them as they have of the names they use for them, or as they have of a yard, or an hour, or any other determinate quantity; it is no wonder if the incomprehensible nature of the thing they discourse of, or reason about, leads them into perplexities and contradictions, and their minds be overlaid by an object too large and mighty to be surveyed and managed by them. 22.

It suffices to my design to show how the mind receives them, such as they are, from sensation and reflection; and how even the idea we have of infinity, how remote soever it may seem to be from any object of sense, or operation of our mind, has, nevertheless, as all our other ideas, its original there. Some mathematicians perhaps, of advanced speculations, may have other ways to introduce into their minds ideas of infinity.

It is sufficient to my purpose to show, that all our simple ideas come to our minds only by sensation and reflection; and that when the mood has them, it can variously repeat and compound them, and so make new complex ideas. But, though white, red, or sweet, &amp;c. have not been modified, or made into complex ideas, by several combinations, so as to be named, and thereby ranked into species; yet some others of the simple ideas, viz. those of unity, duration, and motion, &amp;c., above instanced in, as also power and thinking, have been thus modified to a great variety of complex ideas, with names belonging to them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">一般来说，我们可以看到，那些被认为是同一简单概念的不同程度的简单模式，虽然它们本身是许多非常独特的概念，但通常没有独特的名称，也没有被注意到，作为独特的概念，它们之间的差异只是非常小。人们忽视这些模式，不给它们起名字，是因为没有很好的措施来区分它们；还是因为当它们被如此区分时，这种知识不会有普遍或必要的用途，我把它留给其他人去思考。就我的目的而言，只要说明我们所有的简单观念都是通过感觉和思考才进入我们的头脑的；而当情绪有了这些观念之后，它就可以不同程度地重复和复合它们，从而产生新的复杂观念。但是，尽管白色、红色或甜味等等没有被修改，或通过几种组合成为复杂的观念，从而被命名，并因此被列为物种；但其他一些简单的观念，即上述例子中的统一性、持续时间和运动等等，以及权力和思维，已经被这样修改为大量的复杂观念，并有属于它们的名称。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The reason whereof, I suppose, has been this,—That the great concernment of men being with men one amongst another, the knowledge of men, and their actions, and the signifying of them to one another, was most necessary; and therefore they made ideas of ACTIONS very nicely modified, and gave those complex ideas names, that they might the more easily record and discourse of those things they were daily conversant in, without long ambages and circumlocutions; and that the things they were continually to give and receive information about might be the easier and quicker understood. That this is so, and that men in framing different complex ideas, and giving them names, have been much governed by the end of speech in general, (which is a very short and expedite way of conveying their thoughts one to another), is evident in the names which in several arts have been found out, and applied to several complex ideas of modified actions, belonging to their several trades, for dispatch sake, in their direction or discourses about them. Which ideas are not generally framed in the minds of men not conversant about these operations. And thence the words that stand for them, by the greatest part of men of the same language, are not understood: v. g. COLTSHIRE, DRILLING, FILTRATION, COHOBATION, are words standing for certain complex ideas, which being seldom in the minds of any but those few whose particular employments do at every turn suggest them to their thoughts, those names of them are not generally understood but by smiths and chymists; who, having framed the complex ideas which these words stand for, and having given names to them, or received them from others, upon hearing of these names in communication, readily conceive those ideas in their minds;-as by COHOBATION all the simple ideas of distilling, and the pouring the liquor distilled from anything back upon the remaining matter, and distilling it again. Thus we see that there are great varieties of simple ideas, as of tastes and smells, which have no names; and of modes many more; which either not having been generally enough observed, or else not being of any great use to be taken notice of in the affairs and converse of men, they have not had names given to them, and so pass not for species. This we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large, when we come to speak of WORDS.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我想其原因是这样的--人们最关心的是人与人之间的关系，对人和他们的行为的了解，以及相互之间的表示，是最有必要的；因此，他们对行为的概念进行了很好的修改，并给这些复杂的概念起了名字，以便他们能更容易地记录和谈论他们每天所熟悉的事情，而不需要长篇大论和绕口令；而且，他们不断提供和接受信息的事情也能更容易和更快地理解。事实就是如此，人们在构思不同的复杂概念并为其命名时，在很大程度上受制于一般的语言表达方式，（这是一种非常简短和迅速地将他们的想法传达给另一个人的方式），这一点在几种艺术中发现的名称中是显而易见的，这些名称被应用于属于他们几种行业的、经过修改的行动的复杂概念，以便在指导或讨论这些行动时，能够迅速地完成。在不熟悉这些操作的人的头脑中，一般不会有这种想法。因此，大部分使用同一种语言的人都不理解代表它们的词语：例如例如，COLTSHIRE、DRILLING、FILTRATION、COHOBATION，这些词代表着某些复杂的概念，除了那些从事特殊工作的少数人外，很少有人会想到这些概念，所以除了铁匠和糜烂者外，一般人都不理解这些名称。他们在构思了这些词所代表的复杂概念后，给它们起了名字，或从别人那里得到了这些名字，在交流中听到这些名字后，很容易在头脑中构思出这些概念；就像通过蒸馏的所有简单概念，以及把从任何东西中蒸馏出来的酒倒在剩余的物质上，再进行蒸馏。因此，我们看到，有许多种类的简单概念，如味道和气味，是没有名字的；还有许多模式；这些模式要么没有被普遍观察到，要么在人的事务和交谈中没有被注意到的重大用途，它们没有被赋予名称，因此不被视为物种。这一点我们以后会有机会详细考虑，当我们谈到词语的时候。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">When the mind turns its view inwards upon itself, and contemplates its own actions, THINKING is the first that occurs. In it the mind observes a great variety of modifications, and from thence receives distinct ideas. Thus the perception or thought which actually accompanies, and is annexed to, any impression on the body, made by an external object, being distinct from all other modifications of thinking, furnishes the mind with a distinct idea, which we call SENSATION;—which is, as it were, the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by the senses. The same idea, when it again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external sensory, is REMEMBRANCE: if it be sought after by the mind, and with pain and endeavour found, and brought again in view, it is RECOLLECTION: if it be held there long under attentive consideration, it is CONTEMPLATION: when ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the understanding, it is that which the French call REVERIE; our language has scarce a name for it: when the ideas that offer themselves (for, as I have observed in another place, whilst we are awake, there will always be a train of ideas succeeding one another in our minds) are taken notice of, and, as it were, registered in the memory, it is ATTENTION: when the mind with great earnestness, and of choice, fixes its view on any idea, considers it on all sides, and will not be called off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas, it is that we call INTENTION or STUDY: sleep, without dreaming, is rest from all these: and DREAMING itself is the having of ideas (whilst the outward senses are stopped, so that they receive not outward objects with their usual quickness) in the mind, not suggested by any external objects, or known occasion; nor under any choice or conduct of the understanding at all: and whether that which we call ECSTASY be not dreaming with the eyes open, I leave to be examined.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">当心灵把目光转向自身，并思考自己的行为时，思考是首先发生的。在这一过程中，心灵观察到各种各样的变化，并从那里得到独特的想法。因此，实际伴随着外部物体对身体的任何印象而产生的感知或思想，与所有其他的思维方式不同，为心灵提供了一个独特的想法，我们称之为感性；这就是，任何想法通过感官实际进入理解。同样的想法，当它再次出现时，如果没有类似对象对外部感官的作用，那就是回忆：如果它被头脑寻找，并经过痛苦和努力找到，并再次进入视野，那就是回忆：如果它在认真考虑下长期保持在那里，那就是考虑。当想法在我们的脑海中漂浮，而没有任何思考或理解的考虑时，这就是法国人所说的REVERIE；我们的语言几乎没有这样的名字：当提供给自己的想法（因为，正如我在另一个地方指出的，在我们清醒的时候，总是有一连串的想法在我们的脑海中接连出现）被注意到，并且，就像在记忆中登记一样，这就是注意。当头脑怀着极大的诚意和选择，把它的观点固定在任何想法上，从各个方面考虑它，并且不会被其他想法的普通诱惑所吸引，这就是我们所说的意图或研究：睡眠，没有做梦，是对所有这些的休息。梦境本身就是思想的存在（当外在的感官停止时，所以它们不会以通常的速度接受外在的物体），不是由任何外在的物体或已知的场合所暗示的；也不是在理解力的任何选择或行为之下：而我们称之为ECSTASY的东西是否不是睁着眼睛做梦，我留待研究。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">These are some few instances of those various modes of thinking, which the mind may observe in itself, and so have as distinct ideas of as it hath of white and red, a square or a circle. I do not pretend to enumerate them all, nor to treat at large of this set of ideas, which are got from reflection: that would be to make a volume. It suffices to my present purpose to have shown here, by some few examples, of what sort these ideas are, and how the mind comes by them; especially since I shall have occasion hereafter to treat more at large of REASONING, JUDGING, VOLITION, and KNOWLEDGE, which are some of the most considerable operations of the mind, and modes of thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这些是那些不同的思维模式的一些例子，人们可以在自己身上观察到这些思维模式，因此对它们的想法就像对白色和红色、方形或圆形的想法一样鲜明。我不打算把它们全部列举出来，也不打算大篇幅地论述这一系列从思考中得到的观念：那将是一卷书。就我目前的目的而言，只要在这里通过一些例子说明这些观念是什么样的，以及头脑是如何产生这些观念的就足够了；尤其是因为我以后会有机会更详细地论述推理、判断、意志和知识，这些都是头脑的一些最重要的操作和思维方式。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">But perhaps it may not be an unpardonable digression, nor wholly impertinent to our present design, if we reflect here upon the different state of the mind in thinking, which those instances of attention, reverie, and dreaming, &amp;c., before mentioned, naturally enough suggest. That there are ideas, some or other, always present in the mind of a waking man, every one’s experience convinces him; though the mind employs itself about them with several degrees of attention. Sometimes the mind fixes itself with so much earnestness on the contemplation of some objects, that it turns their ideas on all sides; marks their relations and circumstances; and views every part so nicely and with such intention, that it shuts out all other thoughts, and takes no notice of the ordinary impressions made then on the senses, which at another season would produce very sensible perceptions: at other times it barely observes the train of ideas that succeed in the understanding, without directing and pursuing any of them: and at other times it lets them pass almost quite unregarded, as faint shadows that make no impression.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，如果我们在这里思考一下思维的不同状态，也许就不会是不可原谅的离题，也不会完全不符合我们目前的设计，因为前面提到的那些注意力、遐想和梦境等例子，自然而然地表明了这一点。每个人的经验都表明，在清醒的人的头脑中总是存在着一些或其他的想法；尽管头脑对这些想法的注意程度不同。有时，大脑会非常认真地沉浸在对某些物体的思考中，把它们的想法转到所有方面；标记出它们的关系和情况；对每一个部分都看得如此仔细，如此用心，以至于它把所有其他的想法都拒之门外，对当时在感官上产生的普通印象毫不在意，而这些印象在其他季节会产生非常明智的感知。在其他时候，它几乎没有观察到在理解力中继任的一系列想法，而没有指导和追求其中的任何一个：在其他时候，它让它们几乎完全不被关注，就像没有印象的微弱阴影。</p>

</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">This difference of intention, and remission of the mind in thinking, with a great variety of degrees between earnest study and very near minding nothing at all, every one, I think, has experimented in himself. Trace it a little further, and you find the mind in sleep retired as it were from the senses, and out of the reach of those motions made on the organs of sense, which at other times produce very vivid and sensible ideas. I need not, for this, instance in those who sleep out whole stormy nights, without hearing the thunder, or seeing the lightning, or feeling the shaking of the house, which are sensible enough to those who are waking. But in this retirement of the mind from the senses, it often retains a yet more loose and incoherent manner of thinking, which we call dreaming. And, last of all, sound sleep closes the scene quite, and puts an end to all appearances. This, I think almost every one has experience of in himself, and his own observation without difficulty leads him thus far. That which I would further conclude from hence is, that since the mind can sensibly put on, at several times, several degrees of thinking, and be sometimes, even in a waking man, so remiss, as to have thoughts dim and obscure to that degree that they are very little removed from none at all; and at last, in the dark retirements of sound sleep, loses the sight perfectly of all ideas whatsoever: since, I say, this is evidently so in matter of fact and constant experience, I ask whether it be not probable, that thinking is the action and not the essence of the soul? Since the operations of agents will easily admit of intention and remission: but the essences of things are not conceived capable of any such variation. But this by the by.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我想每个人都在自己身上做过实验，这种意图的不同和思维的放松，以及在认真学习和非常接近于什么都不想的程度之间的巨大差异。再往前追溯，你就会发现睡眠中的思想就像从感官中退了出来，并且不在那些在其他时候产生非常生动和感性的想法的感官器官上的运动的范围之内。为此，我不需要举例说明，有些人在整个暴风雨的夜晚都在睡觉，却没有听到雷声，没有看到闪电，也没有感觉到房子的摇晃，而这些对醒着的人来说是很有意义的。但是，在这种远离感官的状态下，它常常保持着一种更加松散和不连贯的思维方式，我们称之为梦境。最后，酣畅淋漓的睡眠将场景完全封闭，并结束了所有的表象。我想，几乎每个人都有自己的经验，他自己的观察毫无困难地引导他走到这一步。我想从这里进一步得出的结论是，既然头脑可以在几个时间段内，在几个程度上进行思考，甚至在一个清醒的人身上，有时也会如此失职，以至于思想模糊不清，与没有思想相差甚远；最后，在酣睡的黑暗中，完全失去了对所有想法的观察。既然，我说，在事实和不断的经验中，这显然是这样的，我想问，思考是灵魂的行动而不是本质，这难道不是可能的吗？因为代理人的行动很容易允许有意图和减免，但事物的本质却不被认为能够有任何这样的变化。但这是顺便说一下。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">AMONGST the simple ideas which we receive both from sensation and reflection, PAIN and PLEASURE are two very considerable ones. For as in the body there is sensation barely in itself, or accompanied with pain or pleasure, so the thought or perception of the mind is simply so, or else accompanied also with pleasure or pain, delight or trouble, call it how you please. These, like other simple ideas, cannot be described, nor their names defined; the way of knowing them is, as of the simple ideas of the senses, only by experience. For, to define them by the presence of good or evil, is no otherwise to make them known to us than by making us reflect on what we feel in ourselves, upon the several and various operations of good and evil upon our minds, as they are differently applied to or considered by us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我们从感觉和思考中得到的简单想法中，痛苦和快乐是两个非常重要的想法。因为在身体中，感觉本身几乎没有，或者伴随着痛苦或快乐，所以思想或心灵的感知也是如此，否则也会伴随着快乐或痛苦，高兴或烦恼，随你怎么说。这些，像其他简单的观念一样，不能被描述，也不能定义它们的名字；认识它们的方法，就像认识感官的简单观念一样，只能通过经验。因为，用善或恶的存在来定义它们，除了让我们反思我们自己的感受，反思善和恶在我们头脑中的几种不同的作用，因为它们被我们不同地应用或考虑之外，没有别的办法让我们认识它们。</p>

That we call GOOD, which is apt to cause or increase pleasure, or diminish pain in us; or else to procure or preserve us the possession of any other good or absence of any evil. And, on the contrary, we name that EVIL which is apt to produce or increase any pain, or diminish any pleasure in us: or else to procure us any evil, or deprive us of any good. By pleasure and pain, I must be understood to mean of body or mind, as they are commonly distinguished; though in truth they be only different constitutions of the MIND, sometimes occasioned by disorder in the body, sometimes by thoughts of the mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">那么，事物的好坏，只与快乐或痛苦有关。我们称之为 "善"，它能使我们产生或增加快乐，或减少痛苦；或者使我们获得或保持拥有任何其他的善或没有任何恶。相反，我们把容易在我们身上产生或增加任何痛苦，或减少任何快乐，或者为我们带来任何邪恶，或剥夺任何美好的东西，称为邪恶。我所说的快乐和痛苦，必须被理解为身体或心灵的，因为它们通常是有区别的；尽管事实上，它们只是心灵的不同构造，有时是由身体的紊乱引起的，有时是由心灵的想法引起。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Pleasure and pain and that which causes them,—good and evil, are the hinges on which our passions turn. And if we reflect on ourselves, and observe how these, under various considerations, operate in us; what modifications or tempers of mind, what internal sensations (if I may so call them) they produce in us we may thence form to ourselves the ideas of our passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">快乐和痛苦以及导致它们的原因，即善与恶，是我们的激情所依赖的铰链。如果我们反思自己，观察这些东西在不同的考虑因素下是如何在我们身上运作的；它们在我们身上产生什么样的变化或心态，什么样的内部感觉（如果我可以这样称呼它们），我们就可以由此形成我们激情的概念。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thus any one reflecting upon the thought he has of the delight which any present or absent thing is apt to produce in him, has the idea we call LOVE. For when a man declares in autumn when he is eating them, or in spring when there are none, that he loves grapes, it is no more but that the taste of grapes delights him: let an alteration of health or constitution destroy the delight of their taste, and he then can be said to love grapes no longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，任何一个人在思考他对任何现在或不存在的事物容易在他身上产生的快乐的想法时，都会有我们称之为爱的想法。因为当一个人在秋天吃葡萄时，或在春天没有葡萄时，宣称他爱吃葡萄，这不过是葡萄的味道使他高兴而已：如果健康或体质的改变破坏了葡萄味道的喜悦，那么他就可以说是不再爱吃葡萄了。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">On the contrary, the thought of the pain which anything present or absent is apt to produce in us, is what we call HATRED. Were it my business here to inquire any further than into the bare ideas of our passions, as they depend on different modifications of pleasure and pain, I should remark that our love and hatred of inanimate insensible beings is commonly founded on that pleasure and pain which we receive from their use and application any way to our senses though with their destruction. But hatred or love, to beings capable of happiness or misery, is often the uneasiness of delight which we find in ourselves, arising from their very being or happiness. Thus the being and welfare of a man’s children or friends, producing constant delight in him, he is said constantly to love them. But it suffices to note, that our ideas of love and hatred are but the dispositions of the mind, in respect of pleasure and pain in general, however caused in us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">相反，想到任何存在或不存在的东西都会在我们心中产生痛苦，这就是我们所说的憎恨。如果我在这里要进一步探究我们激情的基本概念，因为它们取决于快乐和痛苦的不同变化，那么我应该指出，我们对无生命的无知觉的生命的爱和恨通常是建立在我们从它们的使用和对我们的感官的应用中得到的快乐和痛苦之上的，尽管它们会被破坏。但是，对能够带来幸福或痛苦的生命的憎恨或爱，往往是我们在自己身上发现的快乐的不安，而这种不安是由他们的存在或幸福引起的。因此，一个人的孩子或朋友的存在和福利，在他身上产生了持续的喜悦，他被说成是持续地爱他们。但我们只需注意到，我们的爱与恨的观念不过是心灵的倾向，就一般的快乐和痛苦而言，无论在我们身上如何引起。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of anything whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it, is that we call DESIRE; which is greater or less as that uneasiness is more or less vehement. Where, by the by, it may perhaps be of some use to remark, that the chief, if not only spur to human industry and action is UNEASINESS. For whatsoever good is proposed, if its absence carries no displeasure or pain with it, if a man be easy and content without it, there is no desire of it, nor endeavour after it; there is no more but a bare velleity, the term used to signify the lowest degree of desire, and that which is next to none at all, when there is so little uneasiness in the absence of anything, that it carries a man no further than some faint wishes for it, without any more effectual or vigorous use of the means to attain it. Desire also is stopped or abated by the opinion of the impossibility or unattainableness of the good proposed, as far as the uneasiness is cured or allayed by that consideration. This might carry our thoughts further, were it seasonable in this place.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">一个人在没有任何东西的情况下发现自己的不安，而这些东西目前的享受带有快乐的概念，我们称之为欲望；这种欲望随着这种不安的强烈程度而增大或减弱。顺便说一句，也许可以说，如果不是对人类工业和行动的唯一刺激，也是对人类工业和行动的主要刺激，那就是不愉快。因为无论提出什么好处，如果它的缺失没有带来任何不快或痛苦，如果一个人没有它就会感到轻松和满足，那么就没有对它的渴望，也没有追求它的努力；只有一种赤裸裸的欲望，这个词用来表示最低程度的欲望，也就是几乎没有的欲望，当没有任何东西的时候，人们的不安如此之小，以至于除了对它的一些微弱愿望外，没有更有效或有力地使用手段来达到它。欲望也会因为对所提议的好处的不可能性或不可实现性的看法而停止或减弱，只要不安被这种考虑所治愈或缓解。如果在这个地方合适的话，这可能会使我们的思想更进一步。</p>

But all the rest, terminating purely in pain and pleasure, are, I think, to be found in all men. For we love, desire, rejoice, and hope, only in respect of pleasure; we hate, fear, and grieve, only in respect of pain ultimately. In fine, all these passions are moved by things, only as they appear to be the causes of pleasure and pain, or to have pleasure or pain some way or other annexed to them. Thus we extend our hatred usually to the subject (at least, if a sensible or voluntary agent) which has produced pain in us; because the fear it leaves is a constant pain: but we do not so constantly love what has done us good; because pleasure operates not so strongly on us as pain, and because we are not so ready to have hope it will do so again.

		<p class="calibre5 en">The mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of those simple ideas it observes in things without; and taking notice how one comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist which was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself, and observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the impression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the determination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the future be made in the same things, by like agents, and by the like ways,—considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that change; and so comes by that idea which we call POWER. Thus we say, Fire has a power to melt gold, i. e. to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts, and consequently its hardness, and make it fluid; and gold has a power to be melted; that the sun has a power to blanch wax, and wax a power to be blanched by the sun, whereby the yellowness is destroyed, and whiteness made to exist in its room. In which, and the like cases, the power we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas. For we cannot observe any alteration to be made in, or operation upon anything, but by the observable change of its sensible ideas; nor conceive any alteration to be made, but by conceiving a change of some of its ideas.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">心灵每天都通过感官了解它在外界事物中观察到的那些简单观念的变化；并注意到一个事物是如何结束的，不再存在，而另一个事物则开始存在，这在以前是不存在的；还反思自己内部的事情，观察它的观念的不断变化，有时是由于外界事物对感官的印象，有时是由于自己的选择决定。并从它不断观察到的情况中得出结论，认为今后还会在同样的事物中，通过同样的媒介，以同样的方式发生类似的变化，--在一件事中考虑到它的任何简单观念被改变的可能性，在另一件事中考虑到做出这种改变的可能性；于是产生了我们称之为力量的观念。因此，我们说，火有熔化黄金的能力，即破坏其不可知部分的一致性，从而破坏其硬度，并使其成为流体；黄金有被熔化的能力；太阳有焯水蜡的能力，蜡有被太阳焯水的能力，从而破坏其黄色，使白色存在于其间。在这种情况下，以及类似的情况下，我们考虑的力量是指可感知的观念的变化。因为我们无法观察到任何事物的改变，也无法对其进行操作，只能通过观察其可感知的观念的改变；也无法设想任何改变，只能通过设想其某些观念的改变来进行。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Power thus considered is two-fold, viz. as able to make, or able to receive any change. The one may be called ACTIVE, and the other PASSIVE power. Whether matter be not wholly destitute of active power, as its author, God, is truly above all passive power; and whether the intermediate state of created spirits be not that alone which is capable of both active and passive power, may be worth consideration. I shall not now enter into that inquiry, my present business being not to search into the original of power, but how we come by the IDEA of it. But since active powers make so great a part of our complex ideas of natural substances, (as we shall see hereafter,) and I mention them as such, according to common apprehension; yet they being not, perhaps, so truly ACTIVE powers as our hasty thoughts are apt to represent them, I judge it not amiss, by this intimation, to direct our minds to the consideration of God and spirits, for the clearest idea of ACTIVE power.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这样考虑的权力是双重的，即能够产生或接受任何变化。一种可称为主动的力量，另一种可称为被动的力量。物质是否完全没有主动的能力，因为它的作者--上帝，确实高于所有的被动能力；被造的精神的中间状态是否是唯一能够同时具有主动和被动能力的，可能值得考虑。我现在不打算讨论这个问题，我现在要做的不是探究权力的本源，而是探究我们是如何得到权力的概念的。但是，既然主动的力量在我们关于自然物质的复杂观念中占了如此大的比重，（正如我们将在下文中看到的那样），而且我根据通常的理解，把它们作为这样的力量来提及；但是，它们也许并不像我们仓促的想法所描述的那样是真正的主动力量，我认为，通过这种暗示，把我们的思想引向对上帝和精神的考虑，以获得对主动力量的最清晰的概念，是不会错的。</p>

For, our ideas of extension, duration, and number, do they not all contain in them a secret relation of the parts? Figure and motion have something relative in them much more visibly. And sensible qualities, as colours and smells, &amp;c. what are they but the powers of different bodies, in relation to our perception, &amp;c.? And, if considered in the things themselves, do they not depend on the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of the parts? All which include some kind of relation in them. Our idea therefore of power, I think, may well have a place amongst other SIMPLE IDEAS, and be considered as one of them; being one of those that make a principal ingredient in our complex ideas of substances, as we shall hereafter have occasion to observe.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我承认，权力包括某种关系（与行动或变化的关系），因为我们的任何一种观念，如果仔细考虑的话，确实不包括这种关系。因为，我们关于延伸、持续时间和数量的概念，不都包含着各部分的秘密关系吗？图形和运动在它们里面有更明显的相对性。还有感性的品质，如颜色和气味，等等，它们只不过是不同物体的力量，与我们的知觉有关，等等。而且，如果从事物本身考虑，它们难道不取决于各部分的体积、形状、质地和运动？所有这些都包括了它们之间的某种关系。因此，我认为，我们的力量观念在其他简单的观念中可以占有一席之地，并被视为其中之一；它是构成我们关于物质的复杂观念的主要成分之一，正如我们下面将有机会看到的那样。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Of passive power all sensible things abundantly furnish us with sensible ideas, whose sensible qualities and beings we find to be in continual flux. And therefore with reason we look on them as liable still to the same change. Nor have we of ACTIVE power (which is the more proper signification of the word power) fewer instances. Since whatever change is observed, the mind must collect a power somewhere able to make that change, as well as a possibility in the thing itself to receive it. But yet, if we will consider it attentively, bodies, by our senses, do not afford us so clear and distinct an idea of active power, as we have from reflection on the operations of our minds. For all power relating to action, and there being but two sorts of action whereof we have an idea, viz. thinking and motion, let us consider whence we have the clearest ideas of the powers which produce these actions. (1) Of thinking, body affords us no idea at all; it is only from reflection that we have that. (2) Neither have we from body any idea of the beginning of motion. A body at rest affords us no idea of any active power to move; and when it is set in motion itself, that motion is rather a passion than an action in it. For, when the ball obeys the motion of a billiard-stick, it is not any action of the ball, but bare passion. Also when by impulse it sets another ball in motion that lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it had received from another, and loses in itself so much as the other received: which gives us but a very obscure idea of an ACTIVE power of moving in body, whilst we observe it only to TRANSFER, but not PRODUCE any motion. For it is but a very obscure idea of power which reaches not the production of the action, but the continuation of the passion. For so is motion in a body impelled by another; the continuation of the alteration made in it from rest to motion being little more an action, than the continuation of the alteration of its figure by the same blow is an action. The idea of the BEGINNING of motion we have only from reflection on what passes in ourselves; where we find by experience, that, barely by willing it, barely by a thought of the mind, we can move the parts of our bodies, which were before at rest. So that it seems to me, we have, from the observation of the operation of bodies by our senses, but a very imperfect obscure idea of ACTIVE power; since they afford us not any idea in themselves of the power to begin any action, either motion or thought. But if, from the impulse bodies are observed to make one upon another, any one thinks he has a clear idea of power, it serves as well to my purpose; sensation being one of those ways whereby the mind comes by its ideas: only I thought it worth while to consider here, by the way, whether the mind doth not receive its idea of active power clearer from reflection on its own operations, than it doth from any external sensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在被动的力量中，所有可感知的事物都为我们提供了可感知的观念，我们发现它们的可感知的品质和存在是在不断变化的。因此，我们有理由认为，它们仍有可能发生同样的变化。我们也没有更少的例子来说明积极的力量（这是力量这个词的更恰当的含义）。因为无论观察到什么变化，心灵都必须在某处收集一种能够产生这种变化的力量，以及在事物本身中接受这种变化的可能性。但是，如果我们仔细考虑一下，通过我们的感官，身体并没有给我们提供如此清晰和明确的主动力量的概念，就像我们从对我们思想的运作的思考中得到的那样。对于所有与行动有关的力量，我们只有两种行动，即思考和运动，让我们考虑一下，我们从哪里得到产生这些行动的力量的最清楚的概念。(1) 对于思维，身体根本没有给我们提供任何概念；我们只是从思考中得到了这个概念。(2) 我们从身体上也没有任何关于运动开始的概念。一个静止的身体没有给我们提供任何运动的动力的概念；而当它自己被设定为运动时，这种运动与其说是它的行动，不如说是一种激情。因为，当球服从于台球杆的运动时，这不是球的任何行动，而是赤裸裸的激情。此外，当它通过冲动使挡在它前面的另一个球运动起来时，它只是传递了它从另一个球那里得到的运动，而自己却失去了另一个球所得到的那么多：这给我们一个非常模糊的关于身体运动的主动能力的概念，而我们看到它只是传递而不是产生任何运动。因为这只是一个非常模糊的力量概念，它所达到的不是行动的产生，而是激情的延续。因为一个身体在另一个人的推动下的运动也是如此；在它身上从静止到运动的改变的延续，就像同样的打击对它的形状的改变的延续是一个动作一样，几乎是一个动作。关于运动的开始，我们只是从对我们自己的反思中得到的；在那里，我们通过经验发现，只要愿意，只要心念一动，我们就能移动我们身体中原来静止的部分。因此，在我看来，从我们的感官对身体运作的观察中，我们对主动的力量只有一个非常不完善的模糊概念；因为它们本身没有给我们提供任何开始任何行动的力量的概念，无论是运动还是思想。但是，如果有人从观察到的身体对另一个身体的冲动中，认为自己对力量有一个清晰的概念，这也符合我的目的；感觉是心灵获得其观念的方式之一：只是我认为值得在这里顺便考虑一下，心灵是否从对自身运作的思考中，比从任何外部感觉中更清楚地获得其对主动力量的观念。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This, at least, I think evident,—That we find in ourselves a power to begin or forbear, continue or end several actions of our minds, and motions of our bodies, barely by a thought or preference of the mind ordering, or as it were commanding, the doing or not doing such or such a particular action. This power which the mind has thus to order the consideration of any idea, or the forbearing to consider it; or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest, and vice versa, in any particular instance, is that which we call the WILL. The actual exercise of that power, by directing any particular action, or its forbearance, is that which we call VOLITION or WILLING. The forbearance of that action, consequent to such order or command of the mind, is called VOLUNTARY. And whatsoever action is performed without such a thought of the mind, is called INVOLUNTARY. The power of perception is that which we call the UNDERSTANDING. Perception, which we make the act of the understanding, is of three sorts:—1. The perception of ideas in our minds. 2. The perception of the signification of signs. 3. The perception of the connexion or repugnancy, agreement or disagreement, that there is between any of our ideas. All these are attributed to the understanding, or perceptive power, though it be the two latter only that use allows us to say we understand.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">至少我认为这一点是很明显的，即我们在自己身上发现了一种力量，可以开始或不开始，继续或结束我们思想的若干行动，以及我们身体的运动，几乎是通过思想或偏好来命令，或者说是命令，做或不做这样或那样的特定行动。心灵所拥有的这种能力，即命令考虑任何想法或不考虑它；或在任何特定情况下，倾向于身体任何部分的运动而不是休息，反之亦然，这就是我们所说的意志。通过指导任何特定的行动，实际行使这一权力，或放弃这一权力，就是我们所说的意志或意愿。由于心灵的这种命令或指令而产生的对该行动的忍耐，被称为自愿的。凡是在没有思想的情况下进行的行动，都被称为非自愿的。感知的能力就是我们所说的理解力。感知，也就是我们所说的理解力的行为，有三种类型：1.对我们头脑中的想法的感知。2.2. 对标志的意义的感知。3.3. 对我们任何观念之间的联系或矛盾、一致或不一致的感知。所有这些都归功于理解力，或感知力，尽管只有后两者的使用使我们可以说我们理解。</p>

For when we say the WILL is the commanding and superior faculty of the soul; that it is or is not free; that it determines the inferior faculties; that it follows the dictates of the understanding, &amp;c.,—though these and the like expressions, by those that carefully attend to their own ideas, and conduct their thoughts more by the evidence of things than the sound of words, may be understood in a clear and distinct sense—yet I suspect, I say, that this way of speaking of FACULTIES has misled many into a confused notion of so many distinct agents in us, which had their several provinces and authorities, and did command, obey, and perform several actions, as so many distinct beings; which has been no small occasion of wrangling, obscurity, and uncertainty, in questions relating to them.</p>

Wherever any performance or forbearance are not equally in a man’s power; wherever doing or not doing will not equally FOLLOW upon the preference of his mind directing it, there he is not free, though perhaps the action may be voluntary. So that the idea of LIBERTY is, the idea of a power in any agent to do or forbear any particular action, according to the determination or thought of the mind, whereby either of them is preferred to the other: where either of them is not in the power of the agent to be produced by him according to his volition, there he is not at liberty; that agent is under NECESSITY. So that liberty cannot be where there is no thought, no volition, no will; but there may be thought, there may be will, there may be volition, where there is no liberty. A little consideration of an obvious instance or two may make this clear.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">所有我们认为可以归结为这两种行为的行为，如前所述，即思考和运动；只要一个人有能力根据自己的思想偏好或方向思考或不思考，运动或不运动，那么他就是自由的。只要一个人的表现或忍耐不是平等的；只要做或不做不是平等地按照他的思想的偏好来指导，他就不是自由的，尽管这个行动可能是自愿的。因此，自由的概念是，任何行为人都有权力根据心灵的决定或想法做或不做任何特定的行动，其中任何一个行动都比另一个行动更受欢迎：如果其中任何一个行动不在行为人的权力范围内，由他根据自己的意愿产生，那么他就没有自由；该行为人是在被迫之下。因此，在没有思想、没有意志、没有意愿的地方不可能有自由；但在没有自由的地方可能有思想，可能有意愿，可能有意志。稍微考虑一下一两个明显的例子就可以清楚地看到这一点。</p>

If we inquire into the reason, we shall find it is because we conceive not a tennis-ball to think, and consequently not to have any volition, or PREFERENCE of motion to rest, or vice versa; and therefore has not liberty, is not a free agent; but all its both motion and rest come under our idea of necessary, and are so called. Likewise a man falling into the water, (a bridge breaking under him,) has not herein liberty, is not a free agent. For though he has volition, though he prefers his not falling to falling; yet the forbearance of that motion not being in his power, the stop or cessation of that motion follows not upon his volition; and therefore therein he is not free. So a man striking himself, or his friend, by a convulsive motion of his arm, which it is not in his power, by volition or the direction of his mind, to stop or forbear, nobody thinks he has in this liberty; every one pities him, as acting by necessity and constraint.</p>

I ask, is not this stay voluntary? I think nobody will doubt it: and yet, being locked fast in, it is evident he is not at liberty not to stay, he has not freedom to be gone. So that liberty is not an idea belonging to volition, or preferring; but to the person having the power of doing, or forbearing to do, according as the mind shall choose or direct. Our idea of liberty reaches as far as that power, and no farther. For wherever restraint comes to check that power, or compulsion takes away that indifferency of ability to act, or to forbear acting, there liberty, and our notion of it, presently ceases.</p>

Convulsive motions agitate his legs, so that though he wills it ever so much, he cannot by any power of his mind stop their motion, (as in that odd disease called chorea sancti viti), but he is perpetually dancing; he is not at liberty in this action, but under as much necessity of moving, as a stone that falls, or a tennis-ball struck with a racket. On the other side, a palsy or the stocks hinder his legs from obeying the determination of his mind, if it would thereby transfer his body to another place. In all these there is want of freedom; though the sitting still, even of a paralytic, whilst he prefers it to a removal, is truly voluntary. Voluntary, then, is not opposed to necessary but to involuntary. For a man may prefer what he can do, to what he cannot do; the state he is in, to its absence or change; though necessity has made it in itself unalterable.</p>

A waking man, being under the necessity of having some ideas constantly in his mind, is not at liberty to think or not to think; no more than he is at liberty, whether his body shall touch any other or no, but whether he will remove his contemplation from one idea to another is many times in his choice; and then he is, in respect of his ideas, as much at liberty as he is in respect of bodies he rests on; he can at pleasure remove himself from one to another. But yet some ideas to the mind, like some motions to the body, are such as in certain circumstances it cannot avoid, nor obtain their absence by the utmost effort it can use. A man on the rack is not at liberty to lay by the idea of pain, and divert himself with other contemplations: and sometimes a boisterous passion hurries our thoughts, as a hurricane does our bodies, without leaving us the liberty of thinking on other things, which we would rather choose. But as soon as the mind regains the power to stop or continue, begin or forbear, any of these motions of the body without, or thoughts within, according as it thinks fit to prefer either to the other, we then consider the man as a FREE AGENT again.</p>

Every one would laugh at the absurdity of such a question as either of these: because it is obvious that the modifications of motion belong not to sleep, nor the difference Of figure to virtue; and when any one well considers it, I think he will as plainly perceive that liberty, which is but a power, belongs only to AGENTS, and cannot be an attribute or modification of the will, which is also but a power.</p>

For example, preferring, which seems perhaps best to express the act of volition, does it not precisely. For though a man would prefer flying to walking, yet who can say he ever wills it? Volition, it is plain, is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that dominion it takes itself to have over any part of the man, by employing it in, or withholding it from, any particular action. And what is the will, but the faculty to do this? And is that faculty anything more in effect than a power; the power of the mind to determine its thought, to the producing, continuing, or stopping any action, as far as it depends on us? For can it be denied that whatever agent has a power to think on its own actions, and to prefer their doing or omission either to other, has that faculty called will? WILL, then, is nothing but such a power. LIBERTY, on the other side, is the power a MAN has to do or forbear doing any particular action according as its doing or forbearance has the actual preference in the mind; which is the same thing as to say, according as he himself wills it.</p>

For, who is it that sees not that powers belong only to agents, and are attributes only of substances, and not of powers themselves? So that this way of putting the question (viz. whether the will be free) is in effect to ask, whether the will be a substance, an agent, or at least to suppose it, since freedom can properly be attributed to nothing else. If freedom can with any propriety of speech be applied to power, it may be attributed to the power that is in a man to produce, or forbear producing, motion in parts of his body, by choice or preference; which is that which denominates him free, and is freedom itself. But if any one should ask, whether freedom were free, he would be suspected not to understand well what he said; and he would be thought to deserve Midas’s ears, who, knowing that rich was a denomination for the possession of riches, should demand whether riches themselves were rich.</p>

For, if it be reasonable to suppose and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act, (as we do, when we say the will orders, and the will is free,) it is fit that we should make a speaking faculty, and a walking faculty, and a dancing faculty, by which these actions are produced, which are but several modes of motion; as well as we make the will and understanding to be faculties, by which the actions of choosing and perceiving are produced, which are but several modes of thinking. And we may as properly say that it is the singing faculty sings, and the dancing faculty dances, as that the will chooses, or that the understanding conceives; or, as is usual, that the will directs the understanding, or the understanding obeys or obeys not the will: it being altogether as proper and intelligible to say that the power of speaking directs the power of singing, or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power of speaking.</p>

It looks like too much affectation wholly to lay them by: and philosophy itself, though it likes not a gaudy dress, yet, when it appears in public, must have so much complacency as to be clothed in the ordinary fashion and language of the country, so far as it can consist with truth and perspicuity. But the fault has been, that faculties have been spoken of and represented as so many distinct agents. For, it being asked, what it was that digested the meat in our stomachs? it was a ready and very satisfactory answer to say, that it was the DIGESTIVE FACULTY. What was it that made anything come out of the body? the EXPULSIVE FACULTY. What moved? the MOTIVE FACULTY. And so in the mind, the INTELLECTUAL FACULTY, or the understanding, understood; and the ELECTIVE FACULTY, or the will, willed or commanded. This is, in short, to say, that the ability to digest, digested; and the ability to move, moved; and the ability to understand, understood. For faculty, ability, and power, I think, are but different names of the same things: which ways of speaking, when put into more intelligible words, will, I think, amount to thus much;—That digestion is performed by something that is able to digest, motion by something able to move, and understanding by something able to understand. And, in truth, it would be very strange if it should be otherwise; as strange as it would be for a man to be free without being able to be free.</p>

For if I can, by a thought directing the motion of my finger, make it move when it was at rest, or vice versa, it is evident, that in respect of that I am free: and if I can, by a like thought of my mind, preferring one to the other, produce either words or silence, I am at liberty to speak or hold my peace: and as far as this power reaches, of acting or not acting, by the determination of his own thought preferring either, so far is a man free. For how can we think any one freer, than to have the power to do what he will? And so far as any one can, by preferring any action to its not being, or rest to any action, produce that action or rest, so far can he do what he will. For such a preferring of action to its absence, is the willing of it: and we can scarce tell how to imagine any being freer, than to be able to do what he wills. So that in respect of actions within the reach of such a power in him, a man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make him.</p>

The reason whereof is very manifest. For, it being unavoidable that the action depending on his will should exist or not exist, and its existence or not existence following perfectly the determination and preference of his will, he cannot avoid willing the existence or non-existence of that action; it is absolutely necessary that he will the one or the other; i.e. prefer the one to the other: since one of them must necessarily follow; and that which does follow follows by the choice and determination of his mind; that is, by his willing it: for if he did not will it, it would not be.

		<p class="calibre5 en">This, then, is evident, That A MAN IS NOT AT LIBERTY TO WILL, OR NOT TO WILL, ANYTHING IN HIS POWER THAT HE ONCE CONSIDERS OF: liberty consisting in a power to act or to forbear acting, and in that only. For a man that sits still is said yet to be at liberty; because he can walk if he wills it. A man that walks is at liberty also, not because he walks or moves; but because he can stand still if he wills it. But if a man sitting still has not a power to remove himself, he is not at liberty; so likewise a man falling down a precipice, though in motion, is not at liberty, because he cannot stop that motion if he would. This being so, it is plain that a man that is walking, to whom it is proposed to give off walking, is not at liberty, whether he will determine himself to walk, or give off walking or not: he must necessarily prefer one or the other of them; walking or not walking. And so it is in regard of all other actions in our power they being once proposed, the mind has not a power to act or not to act, wherein consists liberty. The mind, in that case, has not a power to forbear WILLING; it cannot avoid some determination concerning them, let the consideration be as short, the thought as quick as it will, it either leaves the man in the state he was before thinking, or changes it; continues the action, or puts an end to it. Whereby it is manifest, that IT orders and directs one, in preference to, or with neglect of the other, and thereby either the continuation or change becomes UNAVOIDABLY voluntary.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">那么，这就很明显了，一个人在他的权力范围内，一旦考虑到任何事情，就没有意志或不意志的自由：自由包括行动或不行动的权力，而且只包括这个。因为一个坐着不动的人被说成是有自由的；因为如果他愿意，他可以走路。一个走路的人也是自由的，不是因为他走路或移动，而是因为如果他愿意，他可以站着不动。但如果一个坐着不动的人没有能力移动自己，他就不是自由的；同样，一个人从悬崖上掉下来，虽然是在运动中，但也不是自由的，因为如果他想停止运动，就不能停止。既然如此，很明显，一个正在行走的人，如果有人建议他放弃行走，那么他就没有自由，无论他是否愿意决定行走或放弃行走：他必然会选择其中的一个；行走或不行走。就我们权力范围内的所有其他行动而言也是如此，它们一旦被提出来，心灵就没有行动或不行动的权力，其中包括自由。在这种情况下，心灵没有权力放弃意愿；它无法避免对它们作出某种决定，任凭考虑的时间有多短，想法有多快，它要么让人保持他思考前的状态，要么改变它；继续行动，要么结束它。由此可见，它命令和指导了其中一个，而优先于或忽略了另一个，从而使继续或改变成为不可避免的自愿。</p>

This question carries the absurdity of it so manifestly in itself, that one might thereby sufficiently be convinced that liberty concerns not the will. For, to ask whether a man be at liberty to will either motion or rest, speaking or silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man can will what he wills, or be pleased with what he is pleased with? A question which, I think, needs no answer: and they who can make a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts of another, and another to determine that, and so on in infinitum.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, then, it is carefully to be remembered, That freedom consists in the dependence of the existence, or not existence of any ACTION, upon our VOLITION of it; and not in the dependence of any action, or its contrary, on our PREFERENCE. A man standing on a cliff, is at liberty to leap twenty yards downwards into the sea, not because he has a power to do the contrary action, which is to leap twenty yards upwards, for that he cannot do; but he is therefore free, because he has a power to leap or not to leap. But if a greater force than his, either holds him fast, or tumbles him down, he is no longer free in that case; because the doing or forbearance of that particular action is no longer in his power. He that is a close prisoner in a room twenty feet square, being at the north side of his chamber, is at liberty to walk twenty feet southward, because he can walk or not walk it; but is not, at the same time, at liberty to do the contrary, i.e. to walk twenty feet northward.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我们要仔细记住，自由在于任何行动的存在或不存在，都取决于我们对它的意愿；而不在于任何行动或其相反的行动，都取决于我们的偏好。一个人站在悬崖上，可以自由地往下跳20码到海里，这不是因为他有能力做相反的动作，也就是往上跳20码，因为他做不到；但他因此是自由的，因为他有能力跳或不跳。但如果有一种比他更大的力量，要么把他紧紧抓住，要么把他摔倒，在这种情况下，他就不再是自由的了；因为做或不做那个特定的动作，不再是他的权力了。一个被关在20英尺见方的房间里的囚犯，在他房间的北面，可以自由地向南走20英尺，因为他可以走或不走；但同时又不能自由地做相反的事，即向北走20英尺。</p>

To avoid multiplying of words, I would crave leave here, under the word ACTION, to comprehend the forbearance too of any action proposed: sitting still, or holding one’s peace, when walking or speaking are proposed, though mere forbearances, requiring as much the determination of the will, and being as often weighty in their consequences, as the contrary actions, may, on that consideration, well enough pass for actions too: but this I say, that I may not be mistaken, if (for brevity’s sake) I speak thus.</p>

For that which determines the general power of directing, to this or that particular direction, is nothing but the agent itself exercising the power it has that particular way. If this answer satisfies not, it is plain the meaning of the question, What determines the will? is this,—What moves the mind, in every particular instance, to determine its general power of directing, to this or that particular motion or rest? And to this I answer,—The motive for continuing in the same state or action, is only the present satisfaction in it; the motive to change is always some uneasiness: nothing setting us upon the change of state, or upon any new action, but some uneasiness. This is the great motive that works on the mind to put it upon action, which for shortness’ sake we will call determining of the will, which I shall more at large explain.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，意志不过是心灵中的一种力量，可以引导人的操作能力运动或静止，因为它们取决于这种方向；对于什么决定意志的问题，真正和适当的答案是：心灵。因为决定一般指挥能力的，是这个或那个特定的方向，无非是代理人本身在行使它所拥有的那个特定的权力。如果这个答案不能让人满意，那么 "什么决定了意志？"这个问题的意思就很明显了：在每一个特定的例子中，是什么促使心灵决定它的一般指挥能力，去做这个或那个特定的运动或休息？我回答说："继续保持同一状态或行动的动机，只是目前在其中的满足感；改变的动机总是有些不安：没有什么能使我们改变状态，或采取任何新的行动，只有一些不安的感觉。这就是作用于心灵的巨大动机，使它开始行动，为了简短起见，我们称之为意志的决定，我将更多地解释它。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">But, in the way to it, it will be necessary to premise, that, though I have above endeavoured to express the act of volition, by CHOOSING, PREFERRING, and the like terms, that signify desire as well as volition, for want of other words to mark that act of the mind whose proper name is WILLING or VOLITION; yet, it being a very simple act, whosoever desires to understand what it is, will better find it by reflecting on his own mind, and observing what it does when it wills, than by any variety of articulate sounds whatsoever. This caution of being careful not to be misled by expressions that do not enough keep up the difference between the WILL and several acts of the mind that are quite distinct from it, I think the more necessary, because I find the will often confounded with several of the affections, especially DESIRE, and one put for the other; and that by men who would not willingly be thought not to have had very distinct notions of things, and not to have writ very clearly about them. This, I imagine, has been no small occasion of obscurity and mistake in this matter; and therefore is, as much as may be, to be avoided. For he that shall turn his thoughts inwards upon what passes in his mind when he wills, shall see that the will or power of volition is conversant about nothing but our own ACTIONS; terminates there; and reaches no further; and that volition is nothing but that particular determination of the mind, whereby, barely by a thought, the mind endeavours to give rise, continuation, or stop, to any action which it takes to be in its power. This, well considered, plainly shows that the will is perfectly distinguished from desire; which, in the very same action, may have a quite contrary tendency from that which our will sets us upon. A man, whom I cannot deny, may oblige me to use persuasions to another, which, at the same time I am speaking, I may wish may not prevail on him. In this case, it is plain the will and desire run counter. I will the action; that tends one way, whilst my desire tends another, and that the direct contrary way. A man who, by a violent fit of the gout in his limbs, finds a doziness in his head, or a want of appetite in his stomach removed, desires to be eased too of the pain of his feet or hands, (for wherever there is pain, there is a desire to be rid of it,) though yet, whilst he apprehends that the removal of the pain may translate the noxious humour to a more vital part, his will is never determined to any one action that may serve to remove this pain. Whence it is evident that desiring and willing are two distinct acts of the mind; and consequently, that the will, which is but the power of volition, is much more distinct from desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，在这一过程中，有必要指出，虽然我在上面努力用选择、优先和类似的术语来表达意志的行为，这些术语既表示欲望，也表示意志，因为没有其他的词来标记心灵的行为，其正确名称是意志或意志力。然而，这是一个非常简单的行为，无论谁想了解它是什么，都会通过反思自己的思想，观察它在意愿时的表现，而不是通过任何种类的发音来找到它。我认为更有必要提醒大家注意不要被那些没有充分保持意志和与之截然不同的若干心灵行为之间的区别的表达方式所误导，因为我发现意志经常与若干情感，特别是欲望混为一谈，而且是由那些不愿意被认为对事物没有非常明确的概念，也没有对它们写得非常清楚的人提出的。我想，这也是在这个问题上造成模糊和错误的重要原因；因此要尽可能地避免。因为当他把他的思想转向他的意志时，他就会看到，意志或意志力只与我们自己的行动有关；到此为止；不再延伸；而意志只不过是心灵的那种特殊的决定，据此，心灵勉强通过一个想法，努力使它认为在其能力范围内的任何行动产生、延续或停止。这一点，经过深思熟虑，清楚地表明，意志与欲望是完全不同的；在同一行动中，欲望可能会有与我们的意志所决定的完全相反的倾向。一个人，我不能否认他，可能迫使我对另一个人进行劝说，而在我说话的同时，我可能希望这些劝说不会影响到他。在这种情况下，很明显，意志和愿望是相反的。我的意愿是行动；这倾向于一种方式，而我的欲望则倾向于另一种方式，而且是直接相反的方式。一个人由于四肢痛风的剧烈发作，发现头部的瞌睡或胃部的食欲不振被消除了，他也希望能减轻脚或手的疼痛，（因为哪里有疼痛，哪里就有摆脱疼痛的愿望，）尽管如此，当他意识到消除疼痛可能会使有毒物质转移到更重要的部位时，他的意志从未决定采取任何一种可能有助于消除这种疼痛的行动。由此可见，欲望和意愿是心灵的两种不同行为；因此，作为意志力的意志与欲望的区别更大。</p>

And that, upon second thoughts, I am apt to imagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good in view; but some (and for the most part the most pressing) UNEASINESS a man is at present under. This is that which successively determines the will, and sets us upon those actions we perform. This uneasiness we may call, as it is, DESIRE; which is an uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good. All pain of the body, of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind, is uneasiness: and with this is always joined desire, equal to the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce distinguishable from it. For desire being nothing but an uneasiness in the want of an absent good, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till that ease be attained, we may call it desire; nobody feeling pain that he wishes not to be eased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and inseparable from it. Besides this desire of ease from pain, there is another of absent positive good; and here also the desire and uneasiness are equal. As much as we desire any absent good, so much are we in pain for it. But here all absent good does not, according to the greatness it has, or is acknowledged to have, cause pain equal to that greatness; as all pain causes desire equal to itself: because the absence of good is not always a pain, as the presence of pain is. And therefore absent good may be looked on and considered without desire. But so much as there is anywhere of desire, so much there is of uneasiness.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">那么，回到这个问题上，是什么决定了我们行动的意志？仔细一想，我很容易想到，这并不是像一般人认为的那样，是为了更大的利益；而是人目前所处的一些（而且大部分是最紧迫的）不愉快。这就是连续决定意志的东西，使我们开始执行那些行动。这种不安，我们可以称之为欲望；它是一种因缺乏某种不存在的好处而产生的心灵不安。身体的所有疼痛，不管是哪种疼痛，以及心灵的不安，都是不安：与此相伴的总是欲望，与所感受到的疼痛或不安相等；而且与它几乎没有区别。因为欲望只不过是一种对不存在的物品的不安，就所感受到的任何痛苦而言，轻松就是那种不存在的物品；在达到这种轻松之前，我们可以称之为欲望；没有人在感受到他不希望得到缓解的痛苦时，会有一种与这种痛苦相等的欲望，而且与它不可分割。除了这种摆脱痛苦的愿望外，还有一种不存在的积极的善；在这里，愿望和不安也是平等的。我们对任何不存在的善有多大的渴望，我们就为它有多大的痛苦。但在这里，所有不存在的善并不根据它所具有的或被承认具有的伟大性而引起与该伟大性相等的痛苦；就像所有痛苦引起与它本身相等的欲望一样：因为善的不存在并不总是痛苦，就像痛苦的存在那样。因此，不存在的善可以在没有欲望的情况下被看待和考虑。但是，任何地方有多少欲望，就有多少不安。</p>

Who is there that has not felt in desire what the wise man says of hope, (which is not much different from it,) that it being ‘deferred makes the heart sick’; and that still proportionable to the greatness of the desire, which sometimes raises the uneasiness to that pitch, that it makes people cry out, ‘Give me children,’ give me the thing desired, ‘or I die.’ Life itself, and all its enjoyments, is a burden cannot be borne under the lasting and unremoved pressure of such an uneasiness.</p>

Of this every man’s observation will satisfy him. And thus we see our all-wise Maker, suitably to our constitution and frame, and knowing what it is that determines the will, has put into man the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, and other natural desires, that return at their seasons, to move and determine their wills, for the preservation of themselves, and the continuation of their species. For I think we may conclude, that, if the BARE CONTEMPLATION of these good ends to which we are carried by these several uneasinesses had been sufficient to determine the will, and set us on work, we should have had none of these natural pains, and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all. ‘It is better to marry than to burn,’ says St. Paul, where we may see what it is that chiefly drives men into the enjoyments of a conjugal life.

		<p class="calibre5 en">It seems so established and settled a maxim, by the general consent of all mankind, that good, the greater good, determines the will, that I do not at all wonder that, when I first published my thoughts on this subject I took it for granted; and I imagine that, by a great many, I shall be thought more excusable for having then done so, than that now I have ventured to recede from so received an opinion. But yet, upon a stricter inquiry, I am forced to conclude that GOOD, the GREATER GOOD, though apprehended and acknowledged to be so, does not determine the will, until our desire, raised proportionably to it, makes us uneasy in the want of it. Convince a man never so much, that plenty has its advantages over poverty; make him see and own, that the handsome conveniences of life are better than nasty penury: yet, as long as he is content with the latter, and finds no uneasiness in it, he moves not; his will never is determined to any action that shall bring him out of it. Let a man be ever so well persuaded of the advantages of virtue, that it is as necessary to a man who has any great aims in this world, or hopes in the next, as food to life: yet, till he hungers or thirsts after righteousness, till he FEELS AN UNEASINESS in the want of it, his WILL will not be determined to any action in pursuit of this confessed greater good; but any other uneasiness he feels in himself shall take place, and carry his will to other actions. On the other side, let a drunkard see that his health decays, his estate wastes; discredit and diseases, and the want of all things, even of his beloved drink, attends him in the course he follows: yet the returns of uneasiness to miss his companions, the habitual thirst after his cups at the usual time, drives him to the tavern, though he has in his view the loss of health and plenty, and perhaps of the joys of another life: the least of which is no inconsiderable good, but such as he confesses is far greater than the tickling of his palate with a glass of wine, or the idle chat of a soaking club. It is not want of viewing the greater good: for he sees and acknowledges it, and, in the intervals of his drinking hours, will take resolutions to pursue the greater good; but when the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns, the greater acknowledged good loses its hold, and the present uneasiness determines the will to the accustomed action; which thereby gets stronger footing to prevail against the next occasion, though he at the same time makes secret promises to himself that he will do so no more; this is the last time he will act against the attainment of those greater goods. And thus he is, from time to time, in the state of that unhappy complainer, Video meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor: which sentence, allowed for true, and made good by constant experience, may in this, and possibly no other way, be easily made intelligible.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在全人类的普遍认同下，"善"，即更大的 "善"，决定了意志，这似乎是一条既定的格言，所以我一点也不奇怪，当我第一次发表我对这个问题的想法时，我认为这是理所当然的；而且我想，很多人都会认为我当时这样做比我现在冒险放弃这种公认的观点更可原谅。但是，经过更严格的调查，我不得不得出结论："好"，更大的 "好"，虽然被认为是 "好"，但并不决定意志，直到我们的欲望与它成比例地提高，使我们对缺乏它感到不安。让一个人相信，富足比贫穷有好处；让他看到并承认，生活的便利比肮脏的贫穷要好：然而，只要他满足于后者，不觉得不安，他就不会动；他的意志从未决定采取任何能使他摆脱困境的行动。如果一个人对美德的好处深信不疑，认为美德对一个在今世有重大目标或对来世有希望的人来说，就像食物对生命一样必要：然而，直到他对正义感到饥渴，直到他对缺乏正义感到不安，他的意志就不会决心采取任何行动来追求这个公认的更大的好处；但他在自己身上感到的任何其他不安都会发生，并使他的意志转向其他行动。在另一方面，让一个醉汉看到他的健康在下降，他的财产在浪费；名誉和疾病，以及所有东西的匮乏，甚至是他心爱的饮料，在他遵循的过程中伴随着他。然而，错过同伴的不安的回报，在正常时间喝完酒后的习惯性口渴，驱使他去酒馆，尽管在他看来，他失去了健康和富足，也许还有另一种生活的乐趣：其中最小的好处也不是微不足道的，但他承认这种好处远远大于用一杯酒刺激他的味觉，或泡在俱乐部里的闲聊。这并不是没有看到更大的好处：因为他看到并承认它，而且在他喝酒的间隙，会下决心追求更大的好处；但当错过他习惯的快乐的不安回来时，更大的公认的好处就失去了它的控制，目前的不安决定了意志的习惯性行动；从而获得更强的立足点，以对抗下一个场合，尽管他同时向自己秘密承诺，他不会再这样做；这是他最后一次采取行动反对实现那些更大的好处。因此，他不时地处于那个不幸的抱怨者的状态，Video meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor：这句话被认为是真实的，并通过不断的经验而变得很好，可以通过这种方式，也可能没有其他方式，很容易理解。</p>

For, as much as whilst we are under any uneasiness, we cannot apprehend ourselves happy, or in the way to it; pain and uneasiness being, by every one, concluded and felt to be inconsistent with happiness, spoiling the relish even of those good things which we have: a little pain serving to mar all the pleasure we rejoiced in.

		<p class="calibre5 en">Another reason why it is uneasiness alone determines the will, is this: because that alone is present and, it is against the nature of things, that what is absent should operate where it is not. It may be said that absent good may, by contemplation, be brought home to the mind and made present. The idea of it indeed may be in the mind and viewed as present there; but nothing will be in the mind as a present good, able to counterbalance the removal of any uneasiness which we are under, till it raises our desire; and the uneasiness of that has the prevalency in determining the will. Till then, the idea in the mind of whatever is good is there only, like other ideas, the object of bare unactive speculation; but operates not on the will, nor sets us on work; the reason whereof I shall show by and by. How many are to be found that have had lively representations set before their minds of the unspeakable joys of heaven, which they acknowledge both possible and probable too, who yet would be content to take up with their happiness here? And so the prevailing uneasiness of their desires, let loose after the enjoyments of this life, take their turns in the determining their wills; and all that while they take not one step, are not one jot moved, towards the good things of another life, considered as ever so great.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">另一个原因是，只有不安才能决定意志，因为只有不安才是存在的，而且，不存在的东西在不存在的地方发挥作用，是违背事物的本质的。可以说，通过思考，不存在的善可以被带入心灵，并使之呈现。它的想法确实可以在头脑中，并被视为存在于那里；但没有任何东西会在头脑中作为一种当前的好，能够抵消我们所处的任何不安的消除，直到它提高我们的欲望；而这种不安在决定意志方面具有优先权。在这之前，头脑中关于善的观念只是在那里，像其他观念一样，是赤裸裸的不活跃的猜测的对象；但不对意志起作用，也不使我们开始工作；其中的原因我将在下文中说明。有多少人曾在他们的脑海中生动地描述过天堂的不可言喻的快乐，他们承认这也是可能的，也是有可能的，但他们却满足于在这里的幸福？因此，他们的欲望的普遍不安，在今生的享受之后被释放出来，轮流决定他们的意志；所有这些，他们没有采取一步，没有一丁点感动，对另一个生命的美好事物，认为是如此之大。</p>

For, all absent good, by which alone, barely proposed, and coming in view, the will is thought to be determined, and so to set us on action, being only possible, but not infallibly certain, it is unavoidable that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly and steadily in our course towards heaven, without ever standing still, or directing our actions to any other end: the eternal condition of a future state infinitely outweighing the expectation of riches, or honour, or any other worldly pleasure which we can propose to ourselves, though we should grant these the more probable to be obtained: for nothing future is yet in possession, and so the expectation even of these may deceive us. If it were so that the greater good in view determines the will, so great a good, once proposed, could not but seize the will, and hold it fast to the pursuit of this infinitely greatest good, without ever letting it go again: for the will having a power over, and directing the thoughts, as well as other actions, would, if it were so, hold the contemplation of the mind fixed to that good.</p>

But that it is not so, is visible in experience; the infinitely greatest confessed good being often neglected, to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desires pursuing trifles. But, though the greatest allowed, even everlasting unspeakable, good, which has sometimes moved and affected the mind, does not stedfastly hold the will, yet we see any very great and prevailing uneasiness having once laid hold on the will, let it not go; by which we may be convinced, what it is that determines the will. Thus any vehement pain of the body; the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love; or the impatient desire of revenge, keeps the will steady and intent; and the will, thus determined, never lets the understanding lay by the object, but all the thoughts of the mind and powers of the body are uninterruptedly employed that way, by the determination of the will, influenced by that topping uneasiness, as long as it lasts; whereby it seems to me evident, that the will, or power of setting us upon one action in preference to all others, is determined in us by uneasiness: and whether this be not so, I desire every one to observe in himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这将是心灵的状态，也是意志在其所有决定中的常规趋势，如果它是由被认为是更大的利益来决定的话。但事实并非如此，这在经验中是显而易见的；为了满足我们追求琐事的欲望所带来的连续的不安，无限大的公认的好处常常被忽视。但是，尽管最大的、甚至是永恒的、不可言说的善，有时也会感动和影响心灵，但我们看到任何非常大的、普遍的不安一旦抓住了意志，就不会离开；由此我们可以确信，决定意志的是什么。因此，身体的任何剧烈疼痛；恋爱中的人无法控制的激情；或急于复仇的欲望，都会使意志保持稳定和意向。意志如此坚定，永远不会让理解力停留在目标上，而所有的思想和身体的力量都不间断地以这种方式运用，这是意志的决定，受到那种顶级不安的影响，只要它持续下去；因此，在我看来很明显，意志，或让我们优先于所有其他行动的力量，是由不安在我们身上决定的。是否如此，我希望每个人都能在自己身上观察。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">I have hitherto chiefly instanced in the UNEASINESS of desire, as that which determines the will: because that is the chief and most sensible; and the will seldom orders any action, nor is there any voluntary action performed, without some desire accompanying it; which I think is the reason why the will and desire are so often confounded. But yet we are not to look upon the uneasiness which makes up, or at least accompanies, most of the other passions, as wholly excluded in the case. Aversion, fear, anger, envy, shame, &amp;c. have each their uneasinesses too, and thereby influence the will. These passions are scarce any of them, in life and practice, simple and alone, and wholly unmixed with others; though usually, in discourse and contemplation, that carries the name which operates strongest, and appears most in the present state of the mind. Nay, there is, I think, scarce any of the passions to be found without desire joined with it. I am sure wherever there is uneasiness, there is desire. For we constantly desire happiness; and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much it is certain we want of happiness; even in our own opinion, let our state and condition otherwise be what it will. Besides, the present moment not being our eternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look beyond the present, and desire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with it. So that even in joy itself, that which keeps up the action whereon the enjoyment depends, is the desire to continue it, and fear to lose it: and whenever a greater uneasiness than that takes place in the mind, the will presently is by that determined to some new action, and the present delight neglected.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">迄今为止，我主要举例说明欲望的不愉快，因为它决定了意志：因为它是最主要和最明智的；意志很少命令任何行动，也没有任何自愿的行动，没有一些欲望伴随着它；我认为这就是意志和欲望经常被混淆的原因所在。但是，我们不能把构成或至少伴随着大多数其他激情的不安看成是完全被排除在外的情况。厌恶、恐惧、愤怒、嫉妒、羞耻等等，也都有各自的不安，并由此影响到意志。在生活和实践中，这些激情中几乎没有任何一种是简单而单独的，完全不与其他激情相混合的；尽管在讨论和沉思中，通常是以最强烈的、在心灵的当前状态下出现的激情为名。不，我认为，几乎没有任何一种激情是不与欲望结合的。我确信，凡是有不安的地方，就会有欲望。因为我们不断地渴望幸福；无论我们感到怎样的不安，我们肯定都想得到幸福；即使在我们自己看来，我们的状态和条件是什么，也是如此。此外，当下并不是我们的永恒，无论我们的享受如何，我们都会把目光投向当下，欲望会随着我们的预见而去，而这仍然会伴随着意志。因此，即使在快乐本身中，保持享受所依赖的行动的，是对继续享受的渴望和对失去享受的恐惧：只要心中发生比这更大的不安，意志就会因此而决定采取某种新的行动，而忽略目前的快乐。</p>

For, the will being the power of directing our operative faculties to some action, for some end, cannot at any time be moved towards what is judged at that time unattainable: that would be to suppose an intelligent being designedly to act for an end, only to lose its labour; for so it is to act for what is judged not attainable; and therefore very great uneasinesses move not the will, when they are judged not capable of a cure: they in that case put us not upon endeavours. But, these set apart the most important and urgent uneasiness we at that time feel, is that which ordinarily determines the will, successively, in that train of voluntary actions which makes up our lives. The greatest present uneasiness is the spur to action, that is constantly most felt, and for the most part determines the will in its choice of the next action. For this we must carry along with us, that the proper and only object of the will is some action of ours, and nothing else. For we producing nothing by our willing it, but some action in our power, it is there the will terminates, and reaches no further.</p>

All other good, however great in reality or appearance, excites not a man’s desires who looks not on it to make a part of that happiness wherewith he, in his present thoughts, can satisfy himself. Happiness, under this view, every one constantly pursues, and desires what makes any part of it: other things, acknowledged to be good, he can look upon without desire, pass by, and be content without. There is nobody, I think, so senseless as to deny that there is pleasure in knowledge: and for the pleasures of sense, they have too many followers to let it be questioned whether men are taken with them or no. Now, let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures, another in the delight of knowledge: though each of them cannot but confess, there is great pleasure in what the other pursues; yet, neither of them making the other’s delight a part of HIS happiness, their desires are not moved, but each is satisfied without what the other enjoys; and so his will is not determined to the pursuit of it. But yet, as soon as the studious man’s hunger and thirst make him uneasy, he, whose will was never determined to any pursuit of good cheer, poignant sauces, delicious wine, by the pleasant taste he has found in them, is, by the uneasiness of hunger and thirst, presently determined to eating and drinking, though possibly with great indifferency, what wholesome food comes in his way. And, on the other side, the epicure buckles to study, when shame, or the desire to recommend himself to his mistress, shall make him uneasy in the want of any sort of knowledge. Thus, how much soever men are in earnest and constant in pursuit of happiness, yet they may have a clear view of good, great and confessed good, without being concerned for it, or moved by it, if they think they can make up their happiness without it. Though as to pain, THAT they are always concerned for; they can feel no uneasiness without being moved. And therefore, being uneasy in the want of whatever is judged necessary to their happiness, as soon as any good appears to make a part of their portion of happiness, they begin to desire it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">虽然这就是所谓的善与恶，而且所有的善都是一般欲望的适当对象；但所有的善，即使被看作是这样，也不一定能调动每个人的欲望；而只是其中被认为是HIS幸福的必要组成部分的那一部分，或者说是那么多。所有其他的好处，无论在现实或外表上多么伟大，都不会激起一个人的欲望，因为他不认为它是他在目前的想法中可以满足自己的那份幸福的一部分。在这种观点下，每个人都在不断地追求幸福，并渴望成为幸福的一部分：其他被认为是好的东西，他可以无欲无求地看待，擦肩而过，并满足于没有。我想，没有人能够愚蠢到否认知识中的快乐：对于感官的快乐，它们有太多的追随者，以至于人们对它们是否有好感都是个问题。现在，让一个人把他的满足放在感官的快乐上，另一个人把他的满足放在知识的快乐上：虽然他们每个人都不能不承认，另一个人追求的东西有很大的快乐；但是，他们都没有把另一个人的快乐作为他的幸福的一部分，他们的欲望没有被调动，而是每个人在没有另一个人享受的东西时就感到满足；所以他的意志没有决心去追求它。但是，一旦这个好学的人的饥渴使他感到不安，他的意志就会因他在其中发现的愉快的味道而从未决定追求美好的欢愉、凄美的酱汁、美味的酒，而因饥渴的不安而立即决定吃喝，尽管可能是非常冷淡地吃喝他所遇到的有益的食物。另一方面，当羞耻心或向女主人推荐自己的愿望使他因缺乏任何种类的知识而感到不安时，嗜好者就会屈服于学习。因此，无论人们多么认真和不断地追求幸福，但他们可以清楚地看到善，伟大和公认的善，而不关心它，也不为它所动，如果他们认为没有它也能构成他们的幸福。虽然对于痛苦，他们总是担心；他们不会感到不安而不被感动。因此，由于缺乏被认为是他们幸福所必需的东西而感到不安，一旦有任何好处出现，成为他们幸福的一部分，他们就开始渴望得到它。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This, I think, any one may observe in himself and others,—That the greater visible good does not always raise men’s desires in proportion to the greatness it appears, and is acknowledged, to have: though every little trouble moves us, and sets us on work to get rid of it. The reason whereof is evident from the nature of our happiness and misery itself. All present pain, whatever it be, makes a part of our present misery: but all absent good does not at any time make a necessary part of our present happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of our misery. If it did, we should be constantly and infinitely miserable; there being infinite degrees of happiness which are not in our possession. All uneasiness therefore being removed, a moderate portion of good serve at present to content men; and a few degrees of pleasure in a succession of ordinary enjoyments, make up a happiness wherein they can be satisfied. If this were not so, there could be no room for those indifferent and visibly trifling actions, to which our wills are so often determined, and wherein we voluntarily waste so much of our lives; which remissness could by no means consist with a constant determination of will or desire to the greatest apparent good. That this is so, I think few people need go far from home to be convinced. And indeed in this life there are not many whose happiness reaches so far as to afford them a constant train of moderate mean pleasures, without any mixture of uneasiness; and yet they could be content to stay here for ever: though they cannot deny, but that it is possible there may be a state of eternal durable joys after this life, far surpassing all the good that is to be found here. Nay, they cannot but see that it is more possible than the attainment and continuation of that pittance of honour, riches, or pleasure which they pursue, and for which they neglect that eternal state. But yet, in full view of this difference, satisfied of the possibility of a perfect, secure, and lasting happiness in a future state, and under a clear conviction that it is not to be had here,—whilst they bound their happiness within some little enjoyment or aim of this life, and exclude the joys of heaven from making any necessary part of it,—their desires are not moved by this greater apparent good, nor their wills determined to any action, or endeavour for its attainment.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我想，任何人都可以在自己和他人身上看到这一点，即更大的可见利益并不总是与它看起来和被承认的伟大程度成比例地提高人们的欲望：尽管每一个小麻烦都会打动我们，并使我们努力摆脱它。其原因从我们的幸福和痛苦本身的性质就可以看出。所有目前的痛苦，不管它是什么，都是我们目前痛苦的一部分：但所有不存在的好处在任何时候都不会成为我们目前幸福的必要部分，也不会因为没有它而成为我们痛苦的一部分。如果是这样，我们就会不断地、无限地感到痛苦；有无限程度的幸福是我们所不具备的。因此，所有的不安都被消除了，目前，适度的好东西就能让人满足；在一连串的普通享受中的几度快乐，就构成了他们可以得到满足的幸福。如果不是这样，就不会有那些无所谓的和明显的琐碎的行为，我们的意志常常决定于这些行为，而且我们自愿在这些行为中浪费我们生命中的许多时间；这些疏忽决不可能与意志或欲望的持续决定相一致，以获得最大的表面利益。我想，很少有人需要离家很远才能相信这一点。事实上，在这一生中，没有多少人的幸福能达到这样的程度，使他们不断地获得适度的平均快乐，而没有任何不安；但他们可以满足于永远呆在这里：尽管他们不能否认，但有可能在这一生之后有一种永恒的持久的快乐，远远超过在这里可以找到的所有好处。不，他们不能不看到，这比他们所追求的那点荣誉、财富或快乐的实现和延续更有可能，而他们正是为了这些而忽视了那永恒的状态。然而，在充分认识到这一差异的情况下，他们对未来国家的完美、安全和持久的幸福的可能性感到满意，并清楚地相信在这里是得不到的，尽管他们把他们的幸福限制在今生的一些小享受或目标中，并把天堂的快乐排除在它的任何必要部分之外，他们的欲望并没有被这一更大的表面利益所感动，他们的意志也没有决定采取任何行动，或为实现它而努力。</p>

To which, if, besides accidental harms, we add the fantastical uneasiness (as itch after honour, power, or riches, &amp;c.) which acquired habits, by fashion, example, and education, have settled in us, and a thousand other irregular desires, which custom has made natural to us, we shall find that a very little part of our life is so vacant from THESE uneasinesses, as to leave us free to the attraction of remoter absent good. We are seldom at ease, and free enough from the solicitation of our natural or adopted desires, but a constant succession of uneasinesses out of that stock which natural wants or acquired habits have heaped up, take the will in their turns; and no sooner is one action dispatched, which by such a determination of the will we are set upon, but another uneasiness is ready to set us on work. For, the removing of the pains we feel, and are at present pressed with, being the getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing to be done in order to happiness,—absent good, though thought on, confessed, and appearing to be good, not making any part of this unhappiness in its absence, is justled out, to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we feel; till due and repeated contemplation has brought it nearer to our mind, given some relish of it, and raised in us some desire: which then beginning to make a part of our present uneasiness, stands upon fair terms with the rest to be satisfied, and so, according to its greatness and pressure, comes in its turn to determine the will.</p>

The balancing, when there is any in the mind, being only, which desire shall be next satisfied, which uneasiness first removed. Whereby it comes to pass that, as long as any uneasiness, any desire, remains in our mind, there is no room for good, barely as such, to come at the will, or at all to determine it. Because, as has been said, the FIRST step in our endeavours after happiness being to get wholly out of the confines of misery, and to feel no part of it, the will can be at leisure for nothing else, till every uneasiness we feel be perfectly removed: which, in the multitude of wants and desires we are beset with in this imperfect state, we are not like to be ever freed from in this world.</p>

For, the mind having in most cases, as is evident in experience, a power to SUSPEND the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires; and so all, one after another; is at liberty to consider the objects of them, examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. In this lies the liberty man has; and from the not using of it right comes all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults which we run into in the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too soon, before due examination. To prevent this, we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire; as every one daily may experiment in himself. This seems to me the source of all liberty; in this seems to consist that which is (as I think improperly) called FREE-WILL. For, during this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to action, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have opportunity to examine, view, and judge of the good or evil of what we are going to do; and when, upon due examination, we have judged, we have done our duty, all that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness; and it is not a fault, but a perfection of our nature, to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair examination.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我们身上存在着大量的不安，总是在寻求并准备决定意志，正如我所说的，自然是最大的和最紧迫的应该决定意志的下一个行动；在大多数情况下是这样，但并不总是这样。因为，在大多数情况下，正如经验所证明的那样，心灵有能力暂停执行和满足它的任何欲望；因此，所有的欲望都是一个接一个的；它可以自由地考虑它们的对象，从各方面审查它们，并与其他欲望进行权衡。人的自由就在于此；由于没有正确地使用它，我们在生活和追求幸福的努力中会遇到各种各样的错误、误差和过失；而我们在适当的审查之前就匆忙地决定我们的意愿，并过早地参与。为了防止这种情况，我们有能力暂停追求这个或那个愿望；正如每个人每天都可以在自己身上进行试验。在我看来，这就是所有自由的源泉；这似乎包括了被称为自由意志的东西（我认为是不恰当的）。因为，在这种暂停任何欲望的过程中，在决定采取行动和完成行动（在决定之后）之前，我们有机会检查、查看和判断我们将要做的事情的好坏；当经过适当的检查，我们作出判断时，我们已经履行了我们的职责，即我们为追求我们的幸福所能做的或应该做的一切；根据公平检查的最后结果来决定欲望、意志和行动，这不是一种错误，而是我们天性中的一种完善。</p>

A perfect indifference in the mind, not determinable by its last judgment of the good or evil that is thought to attend its choice, would be so far from being an advantage and excellency of any intellectual nature, that it would be as great an imperfection, as the want of indifferency to act, or not to act, till determined by the will, would be an imperfection on the other side. A man is at liberty to lift up his hand to his head, or let it rest quiet: he is perfectly indifferent in either; and it would be an imperfection in him, if he wanted that power, if he were deprived of that indifferency. But it would be as great an imperfection, if he had the same indifferency, whether he would prefer the lifting up his hand, or its remaining in rest, when it would save his head or eyes from a blow he sees coming: it is as much a perfection, that desire, or the power of preferring, should be determined by good, as that the power of acting should be determined by the will; and the certainer such determination is, the greater is the perfection.

Is it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool, and draw shame and misery upon a man’s self? If to break loose from the conduct of reason, and to want that restraint of examination and judgment which keeps us from choosing or doing the worse, be liberty, true liberty, madmen and fools are the only freemen: but yet, I think, nobody would choose to be mad for the sake of such liberty, but he that is mad already. The constant desire of happiness, and the constraint it puts upon us to act for it, nobody, I think, accounts an abridgment of liberty, or at least an abridgment of liberty to be complained of. God Almighty himself is under the necessity of being happy; and the more any intelligent being is so, the nearer is its approach to infinite perfection and happiness. That, in this state of ignorance, we short-sighted creatures might not mistake true felicity, we are endowed with a power to suspend any particular desire, and keep it from determining the will, and engaging us in action. This is standing still, where we are not sufficiently assured of the way: examination is consulting a guide. The determination of the will upon inquiry, is following the direction of that guide: and he that has a power to act or not to act, according as SUCH determination directs, is a free agent: such determination abridges not that power wherein liberty consists. He that has his chains knocked off, and the prison doors set open to him, is perfectly at liberty, because he may either go or stay, as he best likes, though his preference be determined to stay, by the darkness of the night, or illness of the weather, or want of other lodging. He ceases not to be free; though the desire of some convenience to be had there absolutely determines his preference, and makes him stay in his prison.</p>

For, the inclination and tendency of their nature to happiness is an obligation and motive to them, to take care not to mistake or miss it; and so necessarily puts them upon caution, deliberation, and wariness, in the direction of their particular actions, which are the means to obtain it. Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real bliss, the same necessity, with the same force, establishes suspense, deliberation, and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from it. This, as seems to me, is the great privilege of finite intellectual beings; and I desire it may be well considered, whether the great inlet and exercise of all the liberty men have, are capable of, or can be useful to them, and that whereon depends the turn of their actions, does not lie in this,—That they can suspend their desires, and stop them from determining their wills to any action, till they have duly and fairly examined the good and evil of it, as far forth as the weight of the thing requires. This we are able to do; and when we have done it, we have done our duty, and all that is in our power; and indeed all that needs. For, since the will supposes knowledge to guide its choice, all that we can do is to hold our wills undetermined, till we have examined the good and evil of what we desire. What follows after that, follows in a chain of consequences, linked one to another, all depending on the last determination of the judgment, which, whether it shall be upon a hasty and precipitate view, or upon a due and mature examination, is in our power; experience showing us, that in most cases, we are able to suspend the present satisfaction of any desire.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">From what has been said, it is easy to give an account how it comes to pass, that, though all men desire happiness, yet their wills carry them so contrarily; and consequently, some of them to what is evil. And to this I say, that the various and contrary choices that men make in the world do not argue that they do not all pursue good; but that the same thing is not good to every man alike. This variety of pursuits shows, that every one does not place his happiness in the same thing, or choose the same way to it. Were all the concerns of man terminated in this life, why one followed study and knowledge, and another hawking and hunting: why one chose luxury and debauchery, and another sobriety and riches, would not be because every one of these did NOT aim at his own happiness; but because their happiness was placed in different things. And therefore it was a right answer of the physician to his patient that had sore eyes:—If you have more pleasure in the taste of wine than in the use of your sight, wine is good for you; but if the pleasure of seeing be greater to you than that of drinking, wine is naught.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">从上面所说的，很容易就能说明，虽然所有的人都渴望幸福，但他们的意志却如此相反；因此，他们中的一些人就会去做坏事。对此，我说，人在世上所做的各种不同的选择，并不说明他们不是都在追求善，而是说明同样的东西对每个人来说都不是善。这种追求的多样性表明，每个人都不把自己的幸福放在同一件事上，也不选择同样的方式去追求。如果人的所有问题都在今生得到解决，为什么一个人追求学习和知识，另一个人追求捕猎和狩猎，为什么一个人选择奢侈和放荡，另一个人选择清醒和财富，这不是因为每个人都不以自己的幸福为目标；而是因为他们的幸福被放在不同的事情上。因此，医生对眼睛疼痛的病人的回答是正确的："如果你对酒的味道比对视力的使用更有兴趣，酒对你是有好处的；但如果你对视力的兴趣比喝酒的兴趣大，酒就不是东西了。</p>

Hence it was, I think, that the philosophers of old did in vain inquire, whether summum bonum consisted in riches, or bodily delights, or virtue, or contemplation: and they might have as reasonably disputed, whether the best relish were to be found in apples, plums, or nuts, and have divided themselves into sects upon it. For, as pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves, but on their agreeableness to this or that particular palate, wherein there is great variety; so the greatest happiness consists in the having those things which produce the greatest pleasure, and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance, any pain. Now these, to different men, are very different things. If, therefore, men in this life only have hope; if in this life only they can enjoy, it is not strange nor unreasonable, that they should seek their happiness by avoiding all things that disease them here, and by pursuing all that delight them; wherein it will be no wonder to find variety and difference. For if there be no prospect beyond the grave, the inference is certainly right—‘Let us eat and drink,’ let us enjoy what we delight in, ‘for to-morrow we shall die.’ This, I think, may serve to show us the reason, why, though all men’s desires tend to happiness, yet they are not moved by the same object. Men may choose different things, and yet all choose right; supposing them only like a company of poor insects; whereof some are bees, delighted with flowers and their sweetness; others beetles, delighted with other kinds of viands, which having enjoyed for a season, they would cease to be, and exist no more for ever.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">心灵和味觉是不同的；你想用财富或荣誉来取悦所有人（但有些人把他们的幸福寄托于此），就像你想用奶酪或龙虾来满足所有人的饥饿感一样，是没有结果的；虽然对有些人来说，这些食物是非常令人愉快和美味的，但对其他人来说，却是非常恶心和反感的：许多人有理由宁愿饿得肚子咕咕叫，也不愿吃那些对其他人来说是美味的食物。因此，我认为，古代的哲学家们徒劳地探究 "至善 "是由财富、身体的愉悦、美德还是沉思组成的，他们也可以合理地争论，最好的美味是在苹果、李子还是坚果中找到，并因此分成不同的派别。因为，愉快的口味并不取决于事物本身，而是取决于它们对这个或那个特殊的味觉的适应性，其中有很大的差异；所以最大的幸福在于拥有那些产生最大快乐的事物，而没有那些导致任何干扰和痛苦的东西。现在，这些对不同的人来说，是非常不同的东西。因此，如果人在今生只有希望；如果人在今生只能享受，那么，他们通过避免一切使他们在这里感到痛苦的事情和追求一切使他们高兴的事情来寻求他们的幸福，这并不奇怪，也不是没有道理的；在这里，发现各种不同的情况也就不足为奇。因为如果坟墓之外没有前景，推论当然是正确的--'让我们吃喝吧，'让我们享受我们所喜欢的东西，'因为明天我们就会死去。我想，这可能有助于向我们说明，为什么尽管所有的人的欲望都趋向于幸福，但他们却不为同一目标所动。人可以选择不同的东西，但所有的选择都是正确的；假设他们只是像一群可怜的昆虫；其中一些是蜜蜂，喜欢花和它们的甜味；另一些是甲虫，喜欢其他种类的食物，在享受了一个季节后，他们将停止，并永远不存在。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">In the first place, I shall consider the wrong judgments men make of FUTURE good and evil, whereby their desires are misled. For, as to PRESENT happiness and misery, when that alone comes into consideration, and the consequences are quite removed, a man never chooses amiss: he knows what best pleases him, and that he actually prefers. Things in their present enjoyment are what they seem: the apparent and real good are, in this case, always the same. For the pain or pleasure being just so great and no greater than it is felt, the present good or evil is really so much as it appears. And therefore were every action of ours concluded within itself, and drew no consequences after it, we should undoubtedly never err in our choice of good: we should always infallibly prefer the best. Were the pains of honest industry, and of starving with hunger and cold set together before us, nobody would be in doubt which to choose: were the satisfaction of a lust and the joys of heaven offered at once to any one’s present possession, he would not balance, or err in the determination of his choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我将考虑人们对未来的善与恶所做的错误判断，从而使他们的欲望受到误导。因为，对于现在的幸福和痛苦，如果只考虑到这一点，而且后果已经完全消除，那么人的选择就不会有错：他知道什么最能让他高兴，而且他实际上更喜欢。事物在目前的享受中就是它们看起来的样子：在这种情况下，表面的和真正的好总是一样的。因为痛苦或快乐只是如此之大，并没有比它所感受到的更大，现在的善或恶实际上就是它所表现出来的那样。因此，如果我们的每一个行动都是在自己的范围内完成的，并且不产生任何后果，那么我们在选择善的时候无疑就不会出错：我们应该总是无误地选择最好的。如果诚实劳动的痛苦和饥寒交迫的饥饿一起摆在我们面前，没有人会怀疑该选择哪一种：如果欲望的满足和天堂的快乐同时提供给任何人，他不会平衡，也不会错误地决定他的选择。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">But since our voluntary actions carry not all the happiness and misery that depend on them along with them in their present performance, but are the precedent causes of good and evil, which they draw after them, and bring upon us, when they themselves are past and cease to be; our desires look beyond our present enjoyments, and carry the mind out to ABSENT GOOD, according to the necessity which we think there is of it, to the making or increase of our happiness. It is our opinion of such a necessity that gives it its attraction: without that, we are not moved by absent good. For, in this narrow scantling of capacity which we are accustomed to and sensible of here, wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once, which, when all uneasiness is away, is, whilst it lasts, sufficient to make us think ourselves happy, it is not all remote and even apparent good that affects us. Because the indolency and enjoyment we have, sufficing for our present happiness, we desire not to venture the change; since we judge that we are happy already, being content, and that is enough. For who is content is happy. But as soon as any new uneasiness comes in, this happiness is disturbed, and we are set afresh on work in the pursuit of happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，由于我们的自愿行为在其目前的表现中并不携带所有与之相关的幸福和痛苦，而是作为善和恶的先决原因，当它们本身已经过去并不再存在时，它们就会吸引它们，并把它们带给我们；我们的欲望超越我们目前的享受，并根据我们认为它对于创造或增加我们的幸福的必要性，把思想带到不存在的善。正是我们对这种必要性的看法使它具有吸引力：没有这种看法，我们就不会被不存在的善所感动。因为，在我们在这里所习惯和感觉到的这种狭小的能力范围内，我们只同时享受一种快乐，当所有的不安都消失后，在它持续的时候，足以使我们认为自己是幸福的，影响我们的并不是所有遥远的、甚至是表面的善。因为我们所拥有的不愉快和享受，足以满足我们目前的幸福，所以我们不想冒险改变；因为我们判断我们已经很幸福了，很满足，这就够了。因为满足的人是幸福的。但是，一旦有任何新的不安出现，这种幸福就会被打乱，我们就会重新开始工作，追求幸福。</p>

For, whilst such thoughts possess them, the joys of a future state move them not; they have little concern or uneasiness about them; and the will, free from the determination of such desires, is left to the pursuit of nearer satisfactions, and to the removal of those uneasinesses which it then feels, in its want of any longings after them. Change but a man’s view of these things; let him see that virtue and religion are necessary to his happiness; let him look into the future state of bliss or misery, and see there God, the righteous Judge, ready to ‘render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto every soul that doth evil, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish.’ To him, I say, who hath a prospect of the different state of perfect happiness or misery that attends all men after this life, depending on their behaviour here, the measures of good and evil that govern his choice are mightily changed. For, since nothing of pleasure and pain in this life can bear any proportion to the endless happiness or exquisite misery of an immortal soul hereafter, actions in his power will have their preference, not according to the transient pleasure or pain that accompanies or follows them here, but as they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，他们很容易得出结论，认为没有幸福也能得到幸福，这是人往往不愿意去追求最大的不存在的好处的一个重要原因。因为，当这种想法占据他们的时候，未来状态的快乐并没有打动他们；他们对这些快乐没有什么担忧或不安；意志从这种欲望的决定中解脱出来，被留给追求更近一步的满足，以及消除那些它当时感到的不安，因为它没有任何对它们的渴望。改变一个人对这些事情的看法；让他看到美德和宗教对他的幸福是必要的；让他看看未来的幸福或痛苦的状态，并在那里看到上帝，公义的法官，准备'按照每个人的行为给予他们；对于那些通过耐心地继续做善事寻求荣耀、荣誉和不朽的人，是永生；但对于每个做恶的灵魂，是愤怒和生气，苦难和痛苦。我说，对他来说，如果他能预见到所有的人在今生之后会有不同的完美幸福或痛苦的状态，这取决于他们在这里的行为，支配他选择的善和恶的尺度会发生很大的变化。因为，既然今生的快乐和痛苦都无法与不朽的灵魂来世的无尽的幸福或精致的痛苦相提并论，那么，在他权力范围内的行为将有其优先权，不是根据伴随或跟随他们的短暂的快乐或痛苦，而是根据他们有助于确保来世的完美持久的幸福。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">(I) Therefore, as to present pleasure and pain, the mind, as has been said, never mistakes that which is really good or evil; that which is the greater pleasure, or the greater pain, is really just as it appears. But, though present pleasure and pain show their difference and degrees so plainly as not to leave room to mistake; yet, WHEN WE COMPARE PRESENT PLEASURE OR PAIN WITH FUTURE, (which is usually the case in most important determinations of the will,) we often make wrong judgments of them; taking our measures of them in different positions of distance. Objects near our view are apt to be thought greater than those of a larger size that are more remote. And so it is with pleasures and pains: the present is apt to carry it; and those at a distance have the disadvantage in the comparison. Thus most men, like spendthrift heirs, are apt to judge a little in hand better than a great deal to come; and so, for small matters in possession, part with greater ones in reversion. But that this is a wrong judgment every one must allow, let his pleasure consist in whatever it will: since that which is future will certainly come to be present; and then, having the same advantage of nearness, will show itself in its full dimensions, and discover his wilful mistake who judged of it by unequal measures. Were the pleasure of drinking accompanied, the very moment a man takes off his glass, with that sick stomach and aching head which, in some men, are sure to follow not many hours after, I think nobody, whatever pleasure he had in his cups, would, on these conditions, ever let wine touch his lips; which yet he daily swallows, and the evil side comes to be chosen only by the fallacy of a little difference in time. But, if pleasure or pain can be so lessened only by a few hours’ removal, how much more will it be so by a further distance to a man that will not, by a right judgment, do what time will, i. e. bring it home upon himself, and consider it as present, and there take its true dimensions? This is the way we usually impose on ourselves, in respect of bare pleasure and pain, or the true degrees of happiness or misery: the future loses its just proportion, and what is present obtains the preference as the greater. I mention not here the wrong judgment, whereby the absent are not only lessened, but reduced to perfect nothing; when men enjoy what they can in present, and make sure of that, concluding amiss that no evil will thence follow. For that lies not in comparing the greatness of future good and evil, which is that we are here speaking of; but in another sort of wrong judgment, which is concerning good or evil, as it is considered to be the cause and procurement of pleasure or pain that will follow from it.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">(I) 因此，对于现在的快乐和痛苦，正如已经说过的那样，心灵永远不会错失真正的善或恶；那更大的快乐或更大的痛苦，真的就像它看起来那样。但是，尽管现在的快乐和痛苦如此清楚地显示出它们的差异和程度，以至于没有留下错误的余地；然而，当我们将现在的快乐或痛苦与未来的快乐或痛苦相比较时，（在意志的大多数重要决定中通常是这样），我们常常对它们做出错误的判断；在不同的距离位置对它们进行衡量。靠近我们视线的物体很容易被认为比那些更远的大物体要大。快乐和痛苦也是如此：眼前的东西容易让人感觉到；而远处的东西则在比较中处于不利地位。因此，大多数人，就像挥霍无度的继承人一样，往往认为手中的一点东西比未来的一大笔东西要好；因此，为了占有的小东西，把更大的东西分给了继承人。但这是一个错误的判断，每个人都必须承认，让他的快乐由任何东西组成：因为未来的东西肯定会变成现在的东西；然后，由于具有同样的近距离优势，会显示出它的全部尺寸，并发现他故意的错误，他用不平等的措施来判断它。如果饮酒的快乐伴随着，当一个人拿起酒杯的那一刻，有些人的胃和头就会疼痛，而这些症状在几个小时后肯定会出现，我想，无论他在杯子里有什么快乐，在这种情况下，没有人会让酒接触他的嘴唇；但他每天都会吞下酒，而邪恶的一面只是通过时间上的一点差异的谬误来选择。但是，如果快乐或痛苦仅仅通过几个小时的距离就能减少，那么，如果一个人不通过正确的判断，做时间所能做的事情，即把它带回家，把它看作是现在，并在那里得到它的真实尺寸，那么它又会因更远的距离而减少多少？这就是我们通常强加给自己的方式，关于赤裸裸的快乐和痛苦，或者幸福或痛苦的真正程度：未来失去了它应有的比例，而现在的东西则获得了更大的优先权。我在此不提错误的判断，在这种情况下，不存在的东西不仅被减少，而且被降低到完全没有；当人们享受他们目前能做的，并确保这一点，错误地得出结论，认为没有邪恶会随之而来。因为这不在于比较未来善恶的大小，也就是我们这里所说的；而在于另一种错误的判断，即关于善或恶的判断，因为它被认为是快乐或痛苦的原因和来源。</p>

The present pleasure, if it be not very languid, and almost none at all, fills our narrow souls, and so takes up the whole mind that it scarce leaves any thought of things absent: or if among our pleasures there are some which are not strong enough to exclude the consideration of things at a distance, yet we have so great an abhorrence of pain, that a little of it extinguishes all our pleasures. A little bitter mingled in our cup, leaves no relish of the sweet. Hence it comes that, at any rate, we desire to be rid of the present evil, which we are apt to think nothing absent can equal; because, under the present pain, we find not ourselves capable of any the least degree of happiness. Men’s daily complaints are a loud proof of this: the pain that any one actually feels is still of all other the worst; and it is with anguish they cry out,—‘Any rather than this: nothing can be so intolerable as what I now suffer.’ And therefore our whole endeavours and thoughts are intent to get rid of the present evil, before all things, as the first necessary condition to our happiness; let what will follow. Nothing, as we passionately think, can exceed, or almost equal, the uneasiness that sits so heavy upon us. And because the abstinence from a present pleasure that offers itself is a pain, nay, oftentimes a very great one, the desire being inflamed by a near and tempting object, it is no wonder that that operates after the same manner pain does, and lessens in our thoughts what is future; and so forces us, as it were blindfold, into its embraces.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我看来，当我们把现在的快乐或痛苦与未来的快乐或痛苦相比较时，我们的判断是错误的，原因是我们的思维结构薄弱和狭窄。我们不可能同时享受两种快乐；更不可能在痛苦笼罩着我们的时候几乎享受任何快乐。目前的快乐，如果不是非常慵懒，几乎没有的话，就会填满我们狭隘的灵魂，占据整个心灵，以至于几乎没有留下任何对不存在的事物的思考：或者，如果在我们的快乐中，有一些不足以排除对远处事物的思考，但我们对痛苦如此厌恶，以至于一点痛苦就会熄灭我们所有的快乐。在我们的杯子里混入一点苦味，就不会留下一点甜味。因此，无论如何，我们都希望摆脱目前的痛苦，我们往往认为没有什么可以与之相比；因为在目前的痛苦下，我们发现自己没有能力获得任何最起码的幸福。人们每天的抱怨就是一个响亮的证明：任何一个人实际感受到的痛苦仍然是所有其他痛苦中最糟糕的；他们痛苦地喊道："任何时候都比这好：没有什么比我现在遭受的痛苦更令人难以忍受。因此，我们的全部努力和想法都是为了摆脱目前的邪恶，在所有事情之前，作为我们幸福的第一个必要条件；让以后的事情发生。正如我们热切地想的那样，没有什么能超过或几乎等于坐在我们身上的不安。因为放弃现在的快乐是一种痛苦，不，有时是一种非常大的痛苦，因为欲望被一个近在咫尺的诱人对象所激起，这就难怪它以痛苦的方式运作，在我们的思想中减少了未来的东西；因此迫使我们，像蒙上眼睛一样，进入它的怀抱。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Add to this, that absent good, or, which is the same thing, future pleasure,—especially if of a sort we are unacquainted with,—seldom is able to counterbalance any uneasiness, either of pain or desire, which is present. For, its greatness being no more than what shall be really tasted when enjoyed, men are apt enough to lessen that; to make it give place to any present desire; and conclude with themselves that, when it comes to trial, it may possibly not answer the report or opinion that generally passes of it: they having often found that, not only what others have magnified, but even what they themselves have enjoyed with great pleasure and delight at one time, has proved insipid or nauseous at another; and therefore they see nothing in it for which they should forego a present enjoyment. But that this is a false way of judging, when applied to the happiness of another life, they must confess; unless they will say, God cannot make those happy he designs to be so. For that being intended for a state of happiness, it must certainly be agreeable to every one’s wish and desire: could we suppose their relishes as different there as they are here, yet the manna in heaven will suit every one’s palate. Thus much of the wrong judgment we make of present and future pleasure and pain, when they are compared together, and so the absent considered as future.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">此外，不存在的好处，或者说，同样的事情，未来的快乐，--特别是如果是我们不熟悉的那种，--很少能够抵消任何不安，无论是痛苦还是欲望，这是当前的。因为，它的伟大之处不过是在享受时真正品尝到的东西，人们很容易降低它；使它让位于任何当前的欲望；并与自己得出结论，当它被审判时，它可能不符合通常对它的报告或意见：他们经常发现，不仅是别人夸大的东西，甚至是他们自己在某个时候非常高兴和愉快地享受的东西，在另一个时候被证明是平淡或恶心的；因此他们认为它没有什么值得他们放弃当前的享受。但这是一种错误的判断方式，当适用于另一种生活的幸福时，他们必须承认；除非他们会说，上帝不能使他所设计的人幸福。因为既然是为了幸福的状态，它肯定是符合每个人的愿望和欲望的：我们可以假设他们在那里的口味和在这里一样不同，但天堂里的甘露会适合每个人的口味。因此，当我们把现在和未来的快乐和痛苦放在一起比较时，我们对它们的判断是错误的，因此把不存在的东西视为未来的东西。</p>

To check this precipitancy, our understanding and reason were given us, if we will make a right use of them, to search and see, and then judge thereupon.

		<p class="calibre5 en">All men desire happiness, that is past doubt: but, as has been already observed, when they are rid of pain, they are apt to take up with any pleasure at hand, or that custom has endeared to them; to rest satisfied in that; and so being happy, till some new desire, by making them uneasy, disturbs that happiness, and shows them that they are not so, they look no further; nor is the will determined to any action in pursuit of any other known or apparent good. For since we find that we cannot enjoy all sorts of good, but one excludes another; we do not fix our desires on every apparent greater good, unless it be judged to be necessary to our happiness: if we think we can be happy without it, it moves us not. This is another occasion to men of judging wrong; when they take not that to be necessary to their happiness which really is so. This mistake misleads us, both in the choice of the good we aim at, and very often in the means to it, when it is a remote good. But, which way ever it be, either by placing it where really it is not, or by neglecting the means as not necessary to it;—when a man misses his great end, happiness, he will acknowledge he judged not right. That which contributes to this mistake is the real or supposed unpleasantness of the actions which are the way to this end; it seeming so preposterous a thing to men, to make themselves unhappy in order to happiness, that they do not easily bring themselves to it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The last inquiry, therefore, concerning this matter is,—Whether it be in a man’s power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accompanies any sort of action? And as to that, it is plain, in many cases he can. Men may and should correct their palates, and give relish to what either has, or they suppose has none. The relish of the mind is as various as that of the body, and like that too may be altered; and it is a mistake to think that men cannot change the displeasingness or indifferency that is in actions into pleasure and desire, if they will do but what is in their power. A due consideration will do it in some cases; and practice, application, and custom in most. Bread or tobacco may be neglected where they are shown to be useful to health, because of an indifferency or disrelish to them; reason and consideration at first recommends, and begins their trial, and use finds, or custom makes them pleasant. That this is so in virtue too, is very certain. Actions are pleasing or displeasing, either in themselves, or considered as a means to a greater and more desirable end. The eating of a well-seasoned dish, suited to a man’s palate, may move the mind by the delight itself that accompanies the eating, without reference to any other end; to which the consideration of the pleasure there is in health and strength (to which that meat is subservient) may add a new GUSTO, able to make us swallow an ill-relished potion. In the latter of these, any action is rendered more or less pleasing, only by the contemplation of the end, and the being more or less persuaded of its tendency to it, or necessary connexion with it: but the pleasure of the action itself is best acquired or increased by use and practice. Trials often reconcile us to that, which at a distance we looked on with aversion; and by repetitions wear us into a liking of what possibly, in the first essay, displeased us. Habits have powerful charms, and put so strong attractions of easiness and pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to, that we cannot forbear to do, or at least be easy in the omission of, actions, which habitual practice has suited, and thereby recommends to us. Though this be very visible, and every one’s experience shows him he can do so; yet it is a part in the conduct of men towards their happiness, neglected to a degree, that it will be possibly entertained as a paradox, if it be said, that men can MAKE things or actions more or less pleasing to themselves; and thereby remedy that, to which one may justly impute a great deal of their wandering. Fashion and the common opinion having settled wrong notions, and education and custom ill habits, the just values of things are misplaced, and the palates of men corrupted. Pains should be taken to rectify these; and contrary habits change our pleasures, and give a relish to that which is necessary or conducive to our happiness. This every one must confess he can do; and when happiness is lost, and misery overtakes him, he will confess he did amiss in neglecting it, and condemn himself for it; and I ask every one, whether he has not often done so?</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，关于这个问题的最后一个问题是：一个人是否有能力改变伴随任何一种行为的愉快和不愉快？至于这一点，很明显，在许多情况下他可以。人们可以而且应该纠正他们的口味，给那些有的或他们认为没有的东西以美味。心灵的味觉和身体的味觉一样多种多样，而且也可以改变；如果认为人们不能把行动中的不快或冷漠变成快乐和欲望，那就错了，只要他们愿意做自己力所能及的事。在某些情况下，适当的考虑可以做到这一点；而在大多数情况下，实践、应用和习惯都可以做到。面包或烟草在被证明对健康有益的情况下可能会被忽视，因为人们对它们漠不关心或不喜欢；理性和考虑一开始就推荐并开始试用它们，使用后发现，或习惯使它们变得愉快。在美德方面也是如此，这一点是非常确定的。行为是愉快的还是不愉快的，要么是本身，要么被视为达到更大和更理想的目的的手段。吃一道适合人的味觉的调味品，可能会因伴随着吃而产生的愉悦感而打动人心，而不涉及任何其他目的；考虑到健康和力量中的愉悦感（肉是附属品），可能会增加一个新的GUSTO，能够使我们吞下一个不成熟的药水。在后一种情况下，任何行动只有通过对目的的思考，以及或多或少地被说服对它的倾向，或与它的必要联系，才会变得或多或少地令人愉快：但行动本身的乐趣最好通过使用和实践来获得或增加。试炼常常使我们对那些我们在远处就厌恶的东西感到和解；并通过重复使我们喜欢上那些可能在第一次就使我们不高兴的东西。习惯具有强大的魅力，对我们所习惯的事物具有如此强烈的吸引力，以至于我们不能不去做，或者至少是轻松地不去做那些习惯性做法所适合的，从而向我们推荐的行为。尽管这一点非常明显，而且每个人的经验都表明他可以这样做；但这是人在走向幸福的过程中的一部分，在某种程度上被忽视了，如果说人可以使事情或行为更多或更少地取悦于自己，并以此补救，人们可以合理地归咎于他们的大量游荡。时尚和普遍的看法使人们形成了错误的观念，教育和习俗使人们养成了不良的习惯，事物的正确价值被放错了位置，人们的味觉被腐蚀了。应该努力纠正这些问题；相反的习惯会改变我们的乐趣，使那些对我们的幸福有必要或有帮助的东西更有滋味。每个人都必须承认他能做到这一点；当幸福失去，痛苦降临到他身上时，他就会承认他在忽视幸福方面做错了，并为此谴责自己；我问每个人，他是否经常这样做？</p>

This would make a volume, and is not my business. But whatever false notions, or shameful neglect of what is in their power, may put men out of their way to happiness, and distract them, as we see, into so different courses of life, this yet is certain, that morality established upon its true foundations, cannot but determine the choice in any one that will but consider: and he that will not be so far a rational creature as to reflect seriously upon INFINITE happiness and misery, must needs condemn himself as not making that use of his understanding he should. The rewards and punishments of another life which the Almighty has established, as the enforcements of his law, are of weight enough to determine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can show, where the eternal state is considered but in its bare possibility which nobody can make any doubt of. He that will allow exquisite and endless happiness to be but the possible consequence of a good life here, and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one, must own himself to judge very much amiss if he does not conclude,—That a virtuous life, with the certain expectation of everlasting bliss, which may come, is to be preferred to a vicious one, with the fear of that dreadful state of misery, which it is very possible may overtake the guilty; or, at best, the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation. This is evidently so, though the virtuous life here had nothing but pain, and the vicious continual pleasure: which yet is, for the most part, quite otherwise, and wicked men have not much the odds to brag of, even in their present possession; nay, all things rightly considered, have, I think, even the worse part here. But when infinite happiness is put into one scale, against infinite misery in the other; if the worst that comes to the pious man, if he mistakes, be the best that the wicked can attain to, if he be in the right, who can without madness run the venture? Who in his wits would choose to come within a possibility of infinite misery; which if he miss, there is yet nothing to be got by that hazard? Whereas, on the other side, the sober man ventures nothing against infinite happiness to be got, if his expectation comes not to pass. If the good man be in the right, he is eternally happy; if he mistakes, he is not miserable, he feels nothing. On the other side, if the wicked man be in the right, he is not happy; if he mistakes, he is infinitely miserable. Must it not be a most manifest wrong judgment that does not presently see to which side, in this case, the preference is to be given? I have forborne to mention anything of the certainty or probability of a future state, designing here to show the wrong judgment that any one must allow he makes, upon his own principles, laid how he pleases, who prefers the short pleasures of a vicious life upon any consideration, whilst he knows, and cannot but be certain, that a future life is at least possible.</p>

Wherein lighting upon a very easy and scarce observable slip I had made, in putting one seemingly indifferent word for another that discovery opened to me this present view, which here, in this second edition, I submit to the learned world, and which, in short, is this: LIBERTY is a power to act or not to act, according as the mind directs. A power to direct the operative faculties to motion or rest in particular instances is that which we call the WILL. That which in the train of our voluntary actions determines the will to any change of operation is SOME PRESENT UNEASINESS, which is, or at least is always accompanied with that of DESIRE. Desire is always moved by evil, to fly it: because a total freedom from pain always makes a necessary part of our happiness: but every good, nay, every greater good, does not constantly move desire, because it may not make, or may not be taken to make, any necessary part of our happiness. For all that we desire, is only to be happy. But, though this general desire of happiness operates constantly and invariably, yet the satisfaction of any particular desire CAN BE SUSPENDED from determining the will to any subservient action, till we have maturely examined whether the particular apparent good which we then desire makes a part of our real happiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it. The result of our judgment upon that examination is what ultimately determines the man; who could not be FREE if his will were determined by anything but his own desire, guided by his own judgment.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">True notions concerning the nature and extent of LIBERTY are of so great importance, that I hope I shall be pardoned this digression, which my attempt to explain it has led me into. The ideas of will, volition, liberty, and necessity, in this Chapter of Power, came naturally in my way. In a former edition of this Treatise I gave an account of my thoughts concerning them, according to the light I then had. And now, as a lover of truth, and not a worshipper of my own doctrines, I own some change of my opinion; which I think I have discovered ground for. In what I first writ, I with an unbiassed indifferency followed truth, whither I thought she led me. But neither being so vain as to fancy infallibility, nor so disingenuous as to dissemble my mistakes for fear of blemishing my reputation, I have, with the same sincere design for truth only, not been ashamed to publish what a severer inquiry has suggested. It is not impossible but that some may think my former notions right; and some (as I have already found) these latter; and some neither. I shall not at all wonder at this variety in men’s opinions: impartial deductions of reason in controverted points being so rare, and exact ones in abstract notions not so very easy especially if of any length. And, therefore, I should think myself not a little beholden to any one, who would, upon these or any other grounds, fairly clear this subject of LIBERTY from any difficulties that may yet remain.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">关于自由的性质和范围的真正概念是如此重要，以至于我希望能原谅我的这一离题，因为我试图解释它，这使我陷入了困境。在《权力》这一章中，意志、意志、自由和必然性的概念自然而然地进入了我的视野。在本论的前一版中，我根据当时的光线，对我关于它们的想法作了说明。现在，作为一个热爱真理的人，而不是一个崇拜自己学说的人，我的观点有了一些改变；我想我已经找到了理由。在我最初写的东西中，我以一种不偏不倚的冷漠态度追随真理，我认为她把我引向何方。但是，我既没有虚荣到认为自己是无懈可击的，也没有虚伪到因为害怕玷污自己的名誉而掩盖自己的错误，我还是怀着对真理的真诚追求，不耻下问地发表了一个更严厉的调查所建议的内容。有些人可能认为我以前的观点是正确的，有些人（正如我已经发现的那样）认为是后者，有些人则认为两者都不是。我一点也不奇怪人们意见的这种变化：在有争议的问题上进行公正的推理是非常罕见的，而在抽象的概念上进行精确的推理也不太容易，特别是如果有任何长度。因此，我认为，如果有人能根据这些或任何其他理由，公正地把自由这个问题从任何可能存在的困难中解脱出来，我将不吝赐教。</p>

But my present purpose being only to inquire into the knowledge the mind has of things, by those ideas and appearances which God has fitted it to receive from them, and how the mind comes by that knowledge; rather than into their causes or manner of Production, I shall not, contrary to the design of this Essay, see myself to inquire philosophically into the peculiar constitution of BODIES, and the configuration of parts, whereby THEY have the power to produce in us the ideas of their sensible qualities. I shall not enter any further into that disquisition; it sufficing to my purpose to observe, that gold or saffron has power to produce in us the idea of yellow, and snow or milk the idea of white, which we can only have by our sight without examining the texture of the parts of those bodies or the particular figures or motion of the particles which rebound from them, to cause in us that particular sensation, though, when we go beyond the bare ideas in our minds and would inquire into their causes, we cannot conceive anything else to be in any sensible object, whereby it produces different ideas in us, but the different bulk, figure, number, texture, and motion of its insensible parts.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果我们再加上既属于一个又属于另一个的 "存在"、"时间"、"数量"，我们也许就有了所有的原始观念，而其余的观念则依赖于此。因为，我想，如果我们有足够敏锐的能力来感知这些微小物体的各自不同的延伸和运动，从而在我们身上产生这些感觉，那么，通过这些，就可以解释颜色、声音、味道、气味以及我们所拥有的所有其他观念的性质。但是，我现在的目的只是要探究心灵对事物的认识，通过上帝让它从事物中接受的那些观念和表象，以及心灵如何获得这种认识；而不是探究它们的原因或产生方式，因此，与这篇文章的设计相反，我不会从哲学上探究身体的特殊构造，以及各部分的配置，从而使它们有能力在我们身上产生关于它们可感品质的观念。我将不再进一步讨论这个问题。我只想说，黄金或藏红花有能力在我们心中产生黄色的概念，而雪或牛奶有能力产生白色的概念，我们只能通过视觉来获得这种概念，而不需要检查这些物体的部件的质地或从它们中反弹出来的粒子的特殊数字或运动。导致我们产生那种特殊的感觉，尽管当我们超越我们头脑中的赤裸裸的观念，并要探究它们的原因时，我们无法想象任何可感的物体中还有其他东西，它在我们心中产生不同的观念，而只是其不可感的部分的不同体积、形状、数量、纹理和运动。</p>

These mixed modes, being also such combinations of simple ideas as are not looked upon to be characteristical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence, but scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind, are thereby distinguished from the complex ideas of substances.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">That the mind, in respect of its simple ideas, is wholly passive, and receives them all from the existence and operations of things, such as sensation or reflection offers them, without being able to MAKE any one idea, experience shows us. But if we attentively consider these ideas I call mixed modes, we are now speaking of, we shall find their origin quite different. The mind often exercises an ACTIVE power in making these several combinations. For, it being once furnished with simple ideas, it can put them together in several compositions, and so make variety of complex ideas, without examining whether they exist so together in nature. And hence I think it is that these ideas are called NOTIONS: as they had their original, and constant existence, more in the thoughts of men, than in the reality of things; and to form such ideas, it sufficed that the mind put the parts of them together, and that they were consistent in the understanding without considering whether they had any real being: though I do not deny but several of them might be taken from observation, and the existence of several simple ideas so combined, as they are put together in the understanding. For the man who first framed the idea of HYPOCRISY, might have either taken it at first from the observation of one who made show of good qualities which he had not; or else have framed that idea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by. For it is evident that, in the beginning of languages and societies of men, several of those complex ideas, which were consequent to the constitutions established amongst them, must needs have been in the minds of men before they existed anywhere else; and that many names that stood for such complex ideas were in use, and so those ideas framed, before the combinations they stood for ever existed.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">经验告诉我们，就其简单的观念而言，心灵是完全被动的，它从事物的存在和运作中接受它们，如感觉或反思提供给它们的，而不能产生任何一个观念。但是，如果我们仔细考虑我们现在所说的这些我称之为混合模式的观念，我们会发现它们的起源完全不同。心灵在制造这几种组合时经常行使一种积极的力量。因为，它一旦有了简单的观念，就可以把它们组合成若干种构图，从而使复杂的观念变得多种多样，而不需要检查它们是否在自然界中如此存在。因此，我认为这些观念被称为概念：因为它们的原始和持续存在，更多的是在人的思想中，而不是在事物的现实中；要形成这样的观念，只要头脑把它们的各个部分放在一起，并且在理解中是一致的，而不考虑它们是否有任何真实的存在：虽然我不否认，但其中的几个观念可能来自观察，以及几个简单的观念的存在，因为它们在理解中被放在一起。因为最初提出 "HYPOCRISY "这个概念的人，可能一开始就是从对一个表现出他所没有的良好品质的人的观察中得到的；或者是在没有任何这种模式的情况下在他的头脑中提出了这个概念。因为很明显，在人类的语言和社会开始的时候，在他们中间建立的宪法所产生的那些复杂的想法，在他们存在于其他地方之前，必须在人们的头脑中存在；在他们所代表的组合存在之前，许多代表这种复杂想法的名字已经被使用，因此这些想法也被制定了。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Indeed, now that languages are made, and abound with words standing for such combinations, an usual way of GETTING these complex ideas is, by the explication of those terms that stand for them. For, consisting of a company of simple ideas combined, they may, by words standing for those simple ideas, be represented to the mind of one who understands those words, though that complex combination of simple ideas were never offered to his mind by the real existence of things. Thus a man may come to have the idea of SACRILEGE or MURDER, by enumerating to him the simple ideas which these words stand for; without ever seeing either of them committed.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">事实上，既然语言已经产生，并充斥着代表这种组合的词语，那么获得这些复杂观念的一个通常的方法就是，通过对代表这些观念的词语的解释。因为它们由一系列简单的观念组合而成，通过代表这些简单观念的词语，它们可以在理解这些词语的人的头脑中得到体现，尽管这些简单观念的复杂组合从未通过事物的真实存在提供给他的头脑。因此，一个人可以通过列举这些词所代表的简单概念来获得 "牺牲 "或 "谋杀 "的概念；但他从未见过这两种行为。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Every mixed mode consisting of many distinct simple ideas, it seems reasonable to inquire, Whence it has its unity; and how such a precise multitude comes to make but one idea; since that combination does not always exist together in nature? To which I answer, it is plain it has its unity from an act of the mind, combining those several simple ideas together, and considering them as one complex one, consisting of those parts; and the mark of this union, or that which is looked on generally to complete it, is one NAME given to that combination. For it is by their names that men commonly regulate their account of their distinct species of mixed modes, seldom allowing or considering any number of simple ideas to make one complex one, but such collections as there be names for. Thus, though the killing of an old man be as fit in nature to be united into one complex idea, as the killing a man’s father; yet, there being no name standing precisely for the one, as there is the name of PARRICIDE to mark the other, it is not taken for a particular complex idea, nor a distinct species of actions from that of killing a young man, or any other man.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">每一种混合模式都由许多不同的简单概念组成，我们似乎有理由询问：它的统一性从何而来；如此精确的众多概念是如何形成的；因为这种组合在自然界中并不总是同时存在？我回答说，很明显，它的统一性来自于心灵的一种行为，即把那几个简单的观念结合在一起，并把它们看作是由这些部分组成的一个复杂的整体；而这种结合的标志，或者一般被认为是完成它的标志，就是赋予这种结合的一个名称。因为人们通常是通过它们的名字来规范他们对不同种类的混合模式的描述，很少允许或认为任何数量的简单想法构成一个复杂的想法，而是有名字的那种集合。因此，尽管杀死一个老人和杀死一个人的父亲一样，在本质上都适合结合成一个复杂的想法；但是，没有一个名字能准确地代表一个人，就像有一个名字叫PARRICIDE来标志另一个人一样，它不被认为是一个特殊的复杂想法，也不是一个与杀死年轻人或任何其他人不同的行为种类。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This shows us how it comes to pass that there are in every language many particular words which cannot be rendered by any one single word of another. For the several fashions, customs, and manners of one nation, making several combinations of ideas familiar and necessary in one, which another people have had never an occasion to make, or perhaps so much as take notice of, names come of course to be annexed to them, to avoid long periphrases in things of daily conversation; and so they become so many distinct complex ideas in their minds. Thus ostrakismos amongst the Greeks, and proscriptio amongst the Romans, were words which other languages had no names that exactly answered; because they stood for complex ideas which were not in the minds of the men of other nations. Where there was no such custom, there was no notion of any such actions; no use of such combinations of ideas as were united, and, as it were, tied together, by those terms: and therefore in other countries there were no names for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这告诉我们，每一种语言中都有许多特殊的词，不能用另一种语言的任何一个词来表示。因为一个民族的几种时尚、风俗和礼仪，使得另一个民族从来没有机会创造或注意到的几种思想组合在一个民族中变得熟悉和必要，名字当然会被附加到它们身上，以避免在日常谈话中出现冗长的短语；因此它们在他们的头脑中成为许多不同的复杂概念。因此，希腊人的ostrakismos和罗马人的proscriptio都是其他语言没有确切名称的词；因为它们代表了其他国家的人头脑中没有的复杂概念。在没有这种习俗的地方，没有任何这种行为的概念；没有使用这些术语所结合的这种思想组合，而且，就像它被绑在一起一样：因此，在其他国家，没有为它们命名。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Hence also we may see the reason, why languages constantly change, take up new and lay by old terms. Because change of customs and opinions bringing with it new combinations of ideas, which it is necessary frequently to think on and talk about, new names, to avoid long descriptions, are annexed to them; and so they become new species of complex modes. What a number of different ideas are by this means wrapped up in one short sound, and how much of our time and breath is thereby saved, any one will see, who will but take the pains to enumerate all the ideas that either REPRIEVE or APPEAL stand for; and instead of either of those names, use a periphrasis, to make any one understand their meaning.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我们也可以看到，为什么语言不断变化，采用新的和旧的术语的原因。因为习俗和观点的变化带来了新的观念组合，而这些观念又需要经常思考和谈论，所以就给它们起了新的名字，以避免冗长的描述；于是它们就成了复杂模式的新种类。通过这种方式，许多不同的想法被包裹在一个简短的声音中，我们的时间和呼吸因此被节省了多少，任何人都会看到，只要不厌其烦地列举REPRIEVE或APPEAL所代表的所有想法；并使用一个periphrasis来代替这些名字，使任何人都能理解其含义。</p>

For, if we should inquire where the idea of a TRIUMPH or APOTHEOSIS exists, it is evident they could neither of them exist altogether anywhere in the things themselves, being actions that required time to their performance, and so could never all exist together; and as to the minds of men, where the ideas of these actions are supposed to be lodged, they have there too a very uncertain existence: and therefore we are apt to annex them to the names that excite them in us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">虽然我将有机会在讨论词语和它们的使用时更多地考虑这个问题，但我不能避免在这里对混合模式的名称进行如此多的注意；这些名称是简单概念的短暂和短暂的组合，除了在人的头脑中，它们在任何地方都只有短暂的存在，而且在那里也没有比它们被思考时更长久的存在，因此，在这种观念中，它们很容易被当作观念本身。因为，如果我们要问TRIUMPH或APOTHEOSIS的观念存在于何处，显然它们都不可能完全存在于事物本身的任何地方，因为它们是需要时间来完成的行为，所以不可能同时存在；至于人的思想，这些行为的观念被认为存在于那里，它们也有一个非常不确定的存在：因此，我们很容易把它们附在激发它们的名字中。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">There are therefore three ways whereby we get these complex ideas of mixed modes:—(1) By experience and OBSERVATION of things themselves: thus, by seeing two men mixed wrestle or fence, we get the idea of wrestling or fencing. (2) By INVENTION, or voluntary putting together of several simple ideas in our own minds: so he that first invented printing or etching, had an idea of it in his mind before it ever existed. (3) Which is the most usual way, by EXPLAINING THE NAMES of actions we never saw, or motions we cannot see; and by enumerating, and thereby, as it were, setting before our imaginations all those ideas which go to the making them up, and are the constituent parts of them. For, having by sensation and reflection stored our minds with simple ideas, and by use got the names that stand for them, we can by those means represent to another any complex idea we would have him conceive; so that it has in it no simple ideas but what he knows, and has with us the same name for. For all our complex ideas are ultimately resolvable into simple ideas, of which they are compounded and originally made up, though perhaps their immediate ingredients, as I may so say, are also complex ideas. Thus, the mixed mode which the word LIE stands for is made of these simple ideas:—(1) Articulate sounds. (2) Certain ideas in the mind of the speaker. (3) Those words the signs of those ideas. (4) Those signs put together, by affirmation or negation, otherwise than the ideas they stand for are in the mind of the speaker. I think I need not go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie: what I have said is enough to show that it is made up of simple ideas. And it could not be but an offensive tediousness to my reader, to trouble him with a more minute enumeration of every particular simple idea that goes to this complex one; which, from what has been said, he cannot but be able to make out to himself. The same may be done in all our complex ideas whatsoever; which, however compounded and decompounded, may at last be resolved into simple ideas, which are all the materials of knowledge or thought we have, or can have. Nor shall we have reason to fear that the mind is hereby stinted to too scanty a number of ideas, if we consider what an inexhaustible stock of simple modes number and figure alone afford us. How far then mixed modes, which admit of the various combinations of different simple ideas, and their infinite modes, are from being few and scanty, we may easily imagine. So that, before we have done, we shall see that nobody need be afraid he shall not have scope and compass enough for his thoughts to range in, though they be, as I pretend, confined only to simple ideas, received from sensation or reflection, and their several combinations.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，我们有三种方式来获得这些混合模式的复杂概念：（1）通过对事物本身的经验和观察：因此，通过看到两个人混合摔跤或击剑，我们得到了摔跤或击剑的概念。(2) 通过发明，或在我们自己的头脑中自愿把几个简单的想法放在一起：因此，第一个发明印刷术或蚀刻术的人，在它存在之前就已经在他的头脑中有了一个想法。(3）这是最常见的方式，通过解释我们从未见过的行动或我们看不到的运动的名称；通过列举，从而，就像，在我们的想象力面前设置所有这些想法，这些想法是构成它们的组成部分。因为，通过感觉和思考，我们的头脑已经储存了简单的观念，并通过使用得到了代表这些观念的名称，我们可以通过这些手段向另一个人表示我们想让他构思的任何复杂的观念；这样，除了他知道的，并与我们有相同名称的，它就没有简单的观念。因为我们所有的复杂观念最终都可以转化为简单观念，它们是由简单观念组成的，尽管它们的直接成分，正如我可以说的，也是复杂观念。因此，谎言这个词所代表的混合模式是由这些简单的观念组成的：（1）发音的声音。(2) 说话人心中的某些想法。(3) 这些词是这些想法的标志。(4) 这些符号通过肯定或否定放在一起，与它们所代表的思想在说话者心中的位置不同。我想我不需要再进一步分析我们称之为谎言的复杂观念：我所说的足以说明它是由简单的观念组成的。对我的读者来说，麻烦他更详细地列举与这一复杂概念相关的每一个具体的简单概念，只会让他感到乏味；而从刚才的内容来看，他不可能不自己明白。在我们所有的复杂观念中也可以这样做；无论这些观念如何复合和分解，最后都可能被分解成简单的观念，这些观念是我们拥有或能够拥有的所有知识或思想材料。如果我们考虑到仅数字和图形就为我们提供了取之不尽、用之不竭的简单模式，我们也就没有理由担心头脑在这里被限制在太少的想法上。那么，混合模式，即允许不同的简单概念的各种组合，以及它们的无限模式，在多大程度上不属于少数和稀少，我们可以很容易想象。因此，在我们完成工作之前，我们将看到，没有人需要担心他没有足够的范围和指南针供他的思想使用，尽管他们像我假装的那样，只局限于从感觉或思考中得到的简单概念，以及它们的几种组合。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">It is worth our observing, which of all our simple ideas have been MOST modified, and had most mixed ideas made out of them, with names given to them. And those have been these three:—THINKING and MOTION (which are the two ideas which comprehend in them all action,) and POWER, from whence these actions are conceived to flow. These simple ideas, I say, of thinking, motion, and power, have been those which have been most modified; and out of whose modifications have been made most complex modes, with names to them. For ACTION being the great business of mankind, and the whole matter about which all laws are conversant, it is no wonder that the several modes of thinking and motion should be taken notice of, the ideas of them observed, and laid up in the memory, and have names assigned to them; without which laws could be but ill made, or vice and disorders repressed. Nor could any communication be well had amongst men without such complex ideas, with names to them: and therefore men have settled names, and supposed settled ideas in their minds, of modes of actions, distinguished by their causes, means, objects, ends, instruments, time, place, and other circumstances; and also of their powers fitted for those actions: v.g. BOLDNESS is the power to speak or do what we intend, before others, without fear or disorder; and the Greeks call the confidence of speaking by a peculiar name, [word in Greek]: which power or ability in man of doing anything, when it has been acquired by frequent doing the same thing, is that idea we name HABIT; when it is forward, and ready upon every occasion to break into action, we call it DISPOSITION. Thus, TESTINESS is a disposition or aptness to be angry.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">值得我们注意的是，在我们所有的简单观念中，哪些观念被修改得最多，哪些观念被混合在一起，并被赋予了名称。这三个概念是：思维和运动（这两个概念包含了所有的行动）和力量，这些行动被认为来自于此。我说，这些简单的想法，即思考、运动和力量，是那些被修改得最多的想法；从它们的修改中产生了最复杂的模式，并为它们命名。因为行动是人类的大事，也是所有法律所涉及的全部问题，因此，注意到思维和运动的几种模式，观察它们的想法，并将其保存在记忆中，为其命名，也就不足为奇了；没有这些，法律就无法制定，也无法抑制罪恶和混乱。如果没有这种复杂的想法和对它们的命名，人与人之间也不可能有良好的沟通。因此，人们有固定的名字，并在他们的头脑中假定有固定的想法，对行动方式进行区分，以其原因、手段、对象、目的、工具、时间、地点和其他情况来区分；也有适合这些行动的能力：V.g.胆量是指在别人面前说话或做我们想做的事情的能力，没有恐惧或混乱；希腊人把说话的信心称为一个特殊的名字，[希腊语中的单词]：人做任何事情的这种能力或能力，当它是通过经常做同样的事情获得的，是我们称之为习惯的想法；当它是向前的，并在每个场合准备爆发的行动，我们称之为倾向性。因此，脾气是一种倾向或生气的倾向。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">POWER being the source from whence all action proceeds, the substances wherein these powers are, when they *[lost line??] exert this power into act, are called CAUSES, and the substances which thereupon are produced, or the simple ideas which are introduced into any subject by the exerting of that power, are called EFFECTS. The EFFICACY whereby the new substance or idea is produced is called, in the subject exerting that power, ACTION; but in the subject wherein any simple idea is changed or produced, it is called PASSION: which efficacy, however various, and the effects almost infinite, yet we can, I think, conceive it, in intellectual agents, to be nothing else but modes of thinking and willing; in corporeal agents, nothing else but modifications of motion. I say I think we cannot conceive it to be any other but these two. For whatever sort of action besides these produces any effects, I confess myself to have no notion nor idea of; and so it is quite remote from my thoughts, apprehensions, and knowledge; and as much in the dark to me as five other senses, or as the ideas of colours to a blind man. And therefore many words which seem to express some action, signify nothing of the action or MODUS OPERANDI at all, but barely the effect, with some circumstances of the subject wrought on, or cause operating: v.g. CREATION, ANNIHILATION, contain in them no idea of the action or manner whereby they are produced, but barely of the cause, and the thing done. And when a countryman says the cold freezes water, though the word freezing seems to import some action, yet truly it signifies nothing but the effect, viz. that water that was before fluid is become hard and consistent, without containing any idea of the action whereby it is done.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The mind being, as I have declared, furnished with a great number of the simple ideas, conveyed in by the senses as they are found in exterior things, or by reflection on its own operations, takes notice also that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together; which being presumed to belong to one thing, and words being suited to common apprehensions, and made use of for quick dispatch are called, so united in one subject, by one name; which, by inadvertency, we are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea, which indeed is a complication of many ideas together: because, as I have said, not imagining how these simple ideas CAN subsist by themselves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some SUBSTRATUM wherein they do subsist, and from which they do result, which therefore we call SUBSTANCE.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">正如我所宣称的那样，头脑中装有大量的简单观念，这些观念是由感官在外部事物中发现的，或者是通过对自身活动的反思而传递过来的，它还注意到这些简单观念中有一定数量是经常在一起的。假定这些概念属于一个事物，而词语适合于共同的理解，并被用来快速发送，因此在一个主题中以一个名称结合在一起；由于疏忽，我们后来很容易谈论并认为是一个简单的概念，实际上是许多概念的综合体。因为，正如我所说的，我们无法想象这些简单的观念如何能够自己存在，我们习惯于假设一些附属物，在那里它们确实存在，并且从那里产生，因此我们称之为 "物质"。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">So that if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general, he will find he has no other idea of it at all, but only a supposition of he knows not what SUPPORT of such qualities which are capable of producing simple ideas in us; which qualities are commonly called accidents. If any one should be asked, what is the subject wherein colour or weight inheres, he would have nothing to say, but the solid extended parts; and if he were demanded, what is it that solidity and extension adhere in, he would not be in a much better case than the Indian before mentioned who, saying that the world was supported by a great elephant, was asked what the elephant rested on; to which his answer was—a great tortoise: but being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise, replied—SOMETHING, HE KNEW NOT WHAT. And thus here, as in all other cases where we use words without having clear and distinct ideas, we talk like children: who, being questioned what such a thing is, which they know not, readily give this satisfactory answer, that it is SOMETHING: which in truth signifies no more, when so used, either by children or men, but that they know not what; and that the thing they pretend to know, and talk of, is what they have no distinct idea of at all, and so are perfectly ignorant of it, and in the dark. The idea then we have, to which we give the GENERAL name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist SINE RE SUBSTANTE, without something to support them, we call that support SUBSTANTIA; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，如果有人对他关于一般纯物质的概念进行自我检查，他就会发现他根本没有其他的概念，而只是假设他不知道什么是能够在我们身上产生简单观念的这种品质的支持；这些品质通常被称为意外。如果有人被问到，颜色或重量的主体是什么，他将无话可说，只能说是固体的延伸部分；如果有人问他，固体和延伸部分所依附的是什么，他的情况不会比前面提到的那个印度人好多少，他说世界是由一头大象支撑的，有人问他大象靠的是什么；他的回答是--大乌龟。但当他再次被问及是什么支撑着宽背乌龟时，他的回答是：某种东西，他不知道是什么。因此，在这里，就像在所有其他情况下，我们在使用词语时没有清晰明确的概念一样，我们说话就像孩子一样：当被问及他们不知道的东西是什么时，他们很容易给出令人满意的答案，说它是某种东西：事实上，无论是孩子还是男人，这样使用时，都不意味着更多，而是他们不知道是什么；他们假装知道并谈论的东西，是他们根本没有明确概念的东西，所以对它完全无知，并且处于黑暗之中。我们所拥有的概念，我们给它起了一个一般的名字--物质，它只不过是我们发现存在的那些品质的假定的、但不为人知的支持，我们认为这些品质如果没有东西支持，就不可能在SINE RE SUBSTANTE中存在，我们把这种支持称为SUBSTANTIA；根据这个词的真正含义，用普通话来说，就是站在下面或支撑着。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">An obscure and relative idea of SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL being thus made we come to have the ideas of PARTICULAR SORTS OF SUBSTANCES, by collecting SUCH combinations of simple ideas as are, by experience and observation of men’s senses, taken notice of to exist together; and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance. Thus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, &amp;c.; of which substances, whether any one has any other CLEAR idea, further than of certain simple ideas co-existent together, I appeal to every one’s own experience. It is the ordinary qualities observable in iron, or a diamond, put together, that make the true complex idea of those substances, which a smith or a jeweller commonly knows better than a philosopher; who, whatever SUBSTANTIAL FORMS he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances, than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are to be found in them: only we must take notice, that our complex ideas of substances, besides all those simple ideas they are made up of, have always the confused idea of something to which they belong, and in which they subsist: and therefore when we speak of any sort of substance, we say it is a thing having such or such qualities; as body is a thing that is extended, figured, and capable of motion; spirit, a thing capable of thinking; and so hardness, friability, and power to draw iron, we say, are qualities to be found in a loadstone. These, and the like fashions of speaking, intimate that the substance is supposed always SOMETHING BESIDES the extension, figure, solidity, motion, thinking, or other observable ideas, though we know not what it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这样，我们就有了关于一般物质的模糊和相对的概念，通过收集简单概念的组合，即通过人们的经验和感官观察，注意到它们是一起存在的；因此，我们被认为是来自该物质的特定内部结构，或未知的本质。因此，我们就有了人、马、金、水等概念；对于这些物质，除了某些简单的概念同时存在之外，是否有人有其他明确的概念，我呼吁每个人都有自己的经验。铁或钻石中可观察到的普通品质组合在一起，才是这些物质的真正的复杂概念，铁匠或珠宝商通常比哲学家更了解这些概念；哲学家无论谈论什么复杂的形式，对这些物质都没有其他的概念，而只是由那些在其中发现的简单概念的集合所构成。但我们必须注意，我们对物质的复杂概念，除了由所有这些简单的概念组成外，还总是有一个混乱的概念，即它们属于什么，并在其中生存：因此，当我们谈到任何种类的物质时，我们说它是一个具有这样或那样品质的东西；如身体是一个延伸的、有形状的、能够运动的东西；精神是一个能够思考的东西；因此，我们说，硬度、易碎性和拉铁的能力是在一个负载石中可以找到的品质。这些以及类似的说话方式表明，物质被认为总是在延伸、形状、坚固性、运动、思维或其他可观察的概念之外的东西，尽管我们不知道它是什么。</p>

It is plain then, that the idea of CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE in matter is as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions, as that of SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE, or spirit: and therefore, from our not having, any notion of the substance of spirit, we can no more conclude its non-existence, than we can, for the same reason, deny the existence of body; it being as rational to affirm there is no body, because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter, as to say there is no spirit, because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of a spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">同样的事情发生在心灵的运作上，即思考、推理、恐惧等等。我们认为这些行为本身并不存在，也不知道它们如何属于身体，或由身体产生，我们很容易认为这些行为是其他物质的行为，我们称之为精神；然而，很明显，除了那些影响我们感官的许多感性品质存在的东西，我们对物质没有其他想法或概念；通过假设一种物质，思考、认识、怀疑和移动的能力等都存在，我们对精神的物质的概念与我们对身体的概念一样清楚。假设有一种物质存在，其中有思考、认识、怀疑和运动能力等等，那么我们对精神的物质的概念就和对身体的概念一样清楚；一个被认为是（不知道它是什么）我们从外部得到的那些简单想法的基础；另一个被认为是（同样不知道它是什么）我们在自己内部试验的那些行动的基础。那么很明显，物质中的核心物质的概念与我们的概念和理解一样遥远，就像精神物质或精神的概念一样。因此，由于我们没有任何关于精神实质的概念，我们不能得出它不存在的结论，就像我们出于同样的原因否认身体的存在一样；由于我们对物质的实质没有清晰明确的概念，所以肯定没有身体，就像由于我们对精神的实质没有清晰明确的概念，所以说不存在精神一样合理。</p>

It is by such combinations of simple ideas, and nothing else, that we represent particular sorts of substances to ourselves; such are the ideas we have of their several species in our minds; and such only do we, by their specific names, signify to others, v.g. man, horse, sun, water, iron: upon hearing which words, every one who understands the language, frames in his mind a combination of those several simple ideas which he has usually observed, or fancied to exist together under that denomination; all which he supposes to rest in and be, as it were, adherent to that unknown common subject, which inheres not in anything else. Though, in the meantime, it be manifest, and every one, upon inquiry into his own thoughts, will find, that he has no other idea of any substance, v.g. let it be gold, horse, iron, man, vitriol, bread, but what he has barely of those sensible qualities, which he supposes to inhere; with a supposition of such a substratum as gives, as it were, a support to those qualities or simple ideas, which he has observed to exist united together. Thus, the idea of the sun,—what is it but an aggregate of those several simple ideas, bright, hot, roundish, having a constant regular motion, at a certain distance from us, and perhaps some other: as he who thinks and discourses of the sun has been more or less accurate in observing those sensible qualities, ideas, or properties, which are in that thing which he calls the sun.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，无论一般物质的秘密抽象性质如何，我们对特定的不同种类的物质所拥有的所有观念，只不过是简单观念的若干组合，在它们结合的原因中共存，虽然不为人知，但却使整个物质本身得以存在。正是通过这种简单观念的组合，而不是别的，我们向自己表示特定种类的物质；这就是我们对它们在我们头脑中的几个种类的观念；而且只有这样，我们才通过它们的具体名称向别人表示，例如当听到这些词时，每一个理解语言的人都会在他的脑海中把他通常观察到的、或认为存在于该名称下的那几个简单概念组合起来；他认为所有这些概念都依附于那个未知的共同主体，而这个主体并不存在于任何其他东西之中。同时，显而易见的是，每个人在调查自己的思想时都会发现，他对任何物质，例如金、马、铁、人、矾、面包，都没有其他想法，只是勉强认为那些可感的品质，他认为这些品质是存在的；同时认为有这样一个底层，可以支持他所观察到的那些品质或简单的想法，它们是联合起来存在的。因此，太阳的概念--它只不过是那些简单概念的集合体，明亮、炎热、圆润，有恒定的规律运动，与我们有一定的距离，也许还有其他一些：因为思考和讨论太阳的人在观察那些他称之为太阳的东西中的可感品质、概念或属性时，或多或少都是准确的。</p>

Thus, the power of drawing iron is one of the ideas of the complex one of that substance we call a loadstone; and a power to be so drawn is a part of the complex one we call iron: which powers pass for inherent qualities in those subjects. Because every substance, being as apt, by the powers we observe in it, to change some sensible qualities in other subjects, as it is to produce in us those simple ideas which we receive immediately from it, does, by those new sensible qualities introduced into other subjects, discover to us those powers which do thereby mediately affect our senses, as regularly as its sensible qualities do it immediately: v. g. we immediately by our senses perceive in fire its heat and colour; which are, if rightly considered, nothing but powers in it to produce those ideas in US: we also by our senses perceive the colour and brittleness of charcoal, whereby we come by the knowledge of another power in fire, which it has to change the colour and consistency of WOOD. By the former, fire immediately, by the latter, it mediately discovers to us these several powers; which therefore we look upon to be a part of the qualities of fire, and so make them a part of the complex idea of it. For all those powers that we take cognizance of, terminating only in the alteration of some sensible qualities in those subjects on which they operate, and so making them exhibit to us new sensible ideas, therefore it is that I have reckoned these powers amongst the simple ideas which make the complex ones of the sorts of substances; though these powers considered in themselves, are truly complex ideas. And in this looser sense I crave leave to be understood, when I name any of these POTENTIALITIES among the simple ideas which we recollect in our minds when we think of PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES. For the powers that are severally in them are necessary to be considered, if we will have true distinct notions of the several sorts of substances.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因为他对任何一种特定的物质都有最完美的概念，他已经收集并拼凑了那些确实存在于其中的简单概念；其中包括它的主动能力和被动能力，这些能力虽然不是简单的概念，但在这方面，为了简洁起见，可以很方便地被算在它们之中。因此，拉铁的能力是我们称之为负载石的那种物质的复合概念之一；而被拉的能力是我们称之为铁的复合概念的一部分：这些能力在这些主体中被视为固有的品质。因为每一种物质，通过我们在它身上观察到的力量，都很容易改变其他主体的一些感性品质，就像它在我们身上产生那些我们立即从它那里得到的简单观念一样，通过那些引入其他主体的新的感性品质，向我们发现那些因此而立即影响我们感官的力量，就像它的感性品质立即影响我们感官一样：V.我们通过感官立即感知到火的热量和颜色；如果考虑正确的话，这只不过是它在美国产生这些观念的力量：我们还通过感官感知到木炭的颜色和脆性，从而了解到火的另一种力量，它可以改变木材的颜色和一致性。通过前者，火立即发现了这些能力；通过后者，它立即向我们发现了这些能力；因此，我们认为这些能力是火的品质的一部分，并因此使它们成为火的复杂概念的一部分。因为我们所认识到的所有这些力量，最终只是改变了它们所作用的对象的一些感性品质，从而使它们向我们展示了新的感性观念，因此，我把这些力量算作简单观念中的一种，它使各种物质成为复杂观念；尽管这些力量本身被认为是真正的复杂观念。当我把这些潜能命名为我们在想到具体物质时在头脑中回忆的简单观念时，我希望大家能在这个较宽泛的意义上理解。因为如果我们要对几种物质有真正不同的概念，就必须考虑它们各自的力量。</p>

For, our senses failing us in the discovery of the bulk, texture, and figure of the minute parts of bodies, on which their real constitutions and differences depend, we are fain to make use of their secondary qualities as the characteristical notes and marks whereby to frame ideas of them in our minds, and distinguish them one from another: all which secondary qualities, as has been shown, are nothing but bare powers.

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们也不必奇怪，力量在我们对物质的复杂概念中占了很大的比重；因为它们的次要品质在大多数物质中主要是用来区分一个和另一个的，并且通常在它们的各种复杂概念中占了很大的比重。因为我们的感官无法发现身体细微部分的体积、质地和形状，而它们的真正构成和差异又取决于此，所以我们很容易利用它们的次要品质，作为在我们头脑中形成对它们的概念并将它们区分开来的特征说明和标志：所有这些次要品质，正如已经表明的那样，只不过是赤裸裸的力量。因为鸦片的颜色和味道，以及它的镇静剂或麻醉剂的功效，只是一种力量，取决于它的主要品质，据此它在我们身体的不同部位产生不同的作用。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">The ideas that make our complex ones of corporeal substances, are of these three sorts. First, the ideas of the primary qualities of things, which are discovered by our senses, and are in them even when we perceive them not; such are the bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion of the parts of bodies; which are really in them, whether we take notice of them or not. Secondly, the sensible secondary qualities, which, depending on these, are nothing but the powers those substances have to produce several ideas in us by our senses; which ideas are not in the things themselves, otherwise than as anything is in its cause. Thirdly, the aptness we consider in any substance, to give or receive such alterations of primary qualities, as that the substance so altered should produce in us different ideas from what it did before; these are called active and passive powers: all which powers, as far as we have any notice or notion of them, terminate only in sensible simple ideas. For whatever alteration a loadstone has the power to make in the minute particles of iron, we should have no notion of any power it had at all to operate on iron, did not its sensible motion discover it: and I doubt not, but there are a thousand changes, that bodies we daily handle have a power to cause in one another, which we never suspect, because they never appear in sensible effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">使我们对肉体物质产生复杂的想法，有这三种类型。第一，事物的初级品质的观念，这些观念是由我们的感官发现的，即使我们没有察觉到它们，它们也在其中；例如身体各部分的体积、形状、数量、情况和运动；无论我们是否注意到它们，它们确实在其中。第二，感性的次要品质，这些次要品质取决于这些物质，只不过是这些物质通过我们的感官在我们身上产生一些观念的能力；这些观念并不在事物本身，就像任何事物在其原因中一样。第三，我们认为任何物质都有能力给予或接受主要品质的改变，使被改变的物质在我们心中产生与以前不同的观念；这些被称为主动和被动的力量：所有这些力量，只要我们对它们有任何注意或概念，都只终止于可感的简单观念。因为无论一块石头能在铁的微小颗粒上产生什么样的变化，如果不是它的感性运动发现了它，我们根本就不知道它对铁有任何作用力：我不怀疑，我们日常处理的身体有无数种变化，我们从未怀疑过，因为它们从未出现在感性效果中。</p>

He that will examine his complex idea of gold, will find several of its ideas that make it up to be only powers; as the power of being melted, but of not spending itself in the fire; of being dissolved in AQUA REGIA, are ideas as necessary to make up our complex idea of gold, as its colour and weight: which, if duly considered, are also nothing but different powers. For, to speak truly, yellowness is not actually in gold, but is a power in gold to produce that idea in us by our eyes, when placed in a due light: and the heat, which we cannot leave out of our ideas of the sun, is no more really in the sun, than the white colour it introduces into wax. These are both equally powers in the sun, operating, by the motion and figure of its sensible parts, so on a man, as to make him have the idea of heat; and so on wax, as to make it capable to produce in a man the idea of white.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，在我们关于物质的复杂概念中，力量是一个重要部分。审视他对黄金的复杂概念的人，会发现构成它的几个概念只是力量；如被熔化的力量，但不在火中耗尽；在水里溶解，是构成我们对黄金的复杂概念的必要概念，就像它的颜色和重量一样：如果适当地考虑，它们也不过是不同的力量。因为，说实话，黄色实际上并不在黄金中，而是黄金中的一种力量，当放在适当的光线下时，通过我们的眼睛在我们心中产生这种想法：而热，我们不能从我们对太阳的想法中离开，并不像它引入蜡的白色那样真正在太阳中。这两样东西在太阳中都是同样的力量，通过其可感部分的运动和形状，对人产生作用，使他产生热的观念；对蜡也是如此，使它能够在人身上产生白色的观念。</p>

This microscopes plainly discover to us; for what to our naked eyes produces a certain colour, is, by thus augmenting the acuteness of our senses, discovered to be quite a different thing; and the thus altering, as it were, the proportion of the bulk of the minute parts of a coloured object to our usual sight, produces different ideas from what it did before. Thus, sand or pounded glass, which is opaque, and white to the naked eye, is pellucid in a microscope; and a hair seen in this way, loses its former colour, and is, in a great measure, pellucid, with a mixture of some bright sparkling colours, such as appear from the refraction of diamonds, and other pellucid bodies. Blood, to the naked eye, appears all red; but by a good microscope, wherein its lesser parts appear, shows only some few globules of red, swimming in a pellucid liquor, and how these red globules would appear, if glasses could be found that could yet magnify them a thousand or ten thousand times more, is uncertain.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果我们的感官足够敏锐，能够辨别物体的微小颗粒，以及它们的感性品质所依赖的真正结构，我毫不怀疑，它们会在我们心中产生完全不同的想法：现在是黄金的黄色，然后就会消失，取而代之的是一种令人钦佩的、具有一定大小和形状的部件的结构。显微镜向我们清楚地发现了这一点；因为对我们的肉眼来说，产生某种颜色的东西，通过提高我们感官的敏锐度，被发现是完全不同的东西；这样改变，就像改变一个有色物体的微小部分在我们通常视线中的比例一样，产生与以前不同的想法。因此，沙子或捣碎的玻璃，在肉眼看来是不透明的，而且是白色的，但在显微镜下却是透明的；以这种方式看到的头发，失去了它以前的颜色，而且在很大程度上是透明的，混合着一些明亮的闪光的颜色，如从钻石和其他透明体的折射中出现。血液，在肉眼看来，全部是红色的；但在一个好的显微镜下，它较小的部分出现时，只显示出一些红色的球状物，在透明的液体中游动，如果能找到能把它们放大一千或一万倍的眼镜，这些红色的球状物将如何出现，是不确定的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The infinite wise Contriver of us, and all things about us, hath fitted our senses, faculties, and organs, to the conveniences of life, and the business we have to do here. We are able, by our senses, to know and distinguish things: and to examine them so far as to apply them to our uses, and several ways to accommodate the exigences of this life. We have insight enough into their admirable contrivances and wonderful effects, to admire and magnify the wisdom, power and goodness of their Author. Such a knowledge as this which is suited to our present condition, we want not faculties to attain. But it appears not that God intended we should have a perfect, clear, and adequate knowledge of them: that perhaps is not in the comprehension of any finite being. We are furnished with faculties (dull and weak as they are) to discover enough in the creatures to lead us to the knowledge of the Creator, and the knowledge of our duty; and we are fitted well enough with abilities to provide for the conveniences of living: these are our business in this world. But were our senses altered, and made much quicker and acuter, the appearance and outward scheme of things would have quite another face to us; and, I am apt to think, would be inconsistent with our being, or at least wellbeing, in the part of the universe which we inhabit. He that considers how little our constitution is able to bear a remove into part of this air, not much higher than that we commonly breathe in, will have reason to be satisfied, that in this globe of earth allotted for our mansion, the all-wise Architect has suited our organs, and the bodies that are to affect them, one to another. If our sense of hearing were but a thousand times quicker than it is, how would a perpetual noise distract us. And we should in the quietest retirement be less able to sleep or meditate than in the middle of a sea-fight. Nay, if that most instructive of our senses, seeing, were in any man a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute than it is by the best microscope, things several millions of times less than the smallest object of his sight now would then be visible to his naked eyes, and so he would come nearer to the discovery of the texture and motion of the minute parts of corporeal things; and in many of them, probably get ideas of their internal constitutions: but then he would be in a quite different world from other people: nothing would appear the same to him and others: the visible ideas of everything would be different. So that I doubt, whether he and the rest of men could discourse concerning the objects of sight, or have any communication about colours, their appearances being so wholly different. And perhaps such a quickness and tenderness of sight could not endure bright sunshine, or so much as open daylight; nor take in but a very small part of any object at once, and that too only at a very near distance. And if by the help of such MICROSCOPICAL EYES (if I may so call them) a man could penetrate further than ordinary into the secret composition and radical texture of bodies, he would not make any great advantage by the change, if such an acute sight would not serve to conduct him to the market and exchange; if he could not see things he was to avoid, at a convenient distance; nor distinguish things he had to do with by those sensible qualities others do. He that was sharp-sighted enough to see the configuration of the minute particles of the spring of a clock, and observe upon what peculiar structure and impulse its elastic motion depends, would no doubt discover something very admirable: but if eyes so framed could not view at once the hand, and the characters of the hour-plate, and thereby at a distance see what o’clock it was, their owner could not be much benefited by that acuteness; which, whilst it discovered the secret contrivance of the parts of the machine, made him lose its use.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">And here give me leave to propose an extravagant conjecture of mine, viz. That since we have some reason (if there be any credit to be given to the report of things that our philosophy cannot account for) to imagine, that Spirits can assume to themselves bodies of different bulk, figure, and conformation of parts—whether one great advantage some of them have over us may not lie in this, that they can so frame and shape to themselves organs of sensation or perception, as to suit them to their present design, and the circumstances of the object they would consider. For how much would that man exceed all others in knowledge, who had but the faculty so to alter the structure of his eyes, that one sense, as to make it capable of all the several degrees of vision which the assistance of glasses (casually at first lighted on) has taught us to conceive? What wonders would he discover, who could so fit his eyes to all sorts of objects, as to see when he pleased the figure and motion of the minute particles in the blood, and other juices of animals, as distinctly as he does, at other times, the shape and motion of the animals themselves? But to us, in our present state, unalterable organs, so contrived as to discover the figure and motion of the minute parts of bodies, whereon depend those sensible qualities we now observe in them, would perhaps be of no advantage. God has no doubt made them so as is best for us in our present condition. He hath fitted us for the neighbourhood of the bodies that surround us, and we have to do with; and though we cannot, by the faculties we have, attain to a perfect knowledge of things, yet they will serve us well enough for those ends above-mentioned, which are our great concernment. I beg my reader’s pardon for laying before him so wild a fancy concerning the ways of perception of beings above us; but how extravagant soever it be, I doubt whether we can imagine anything about the knowledge of angels but after this manner, some way or other in proportion to what we find and observe in ourselves. And though we cannot but allow that the infinite power and wisdom of God may frame creatures with a thousand other faculties and ways of perceiving things without them than what we have, yet our thoughts can go no further than our own: so impossible it is for us to enlarge our very guesses beyond the ideas received from our own sensation and reflection. The supposition, at least, that angels do sometimes assume bodies, needs not startle us; since some of the most ancient and most learned Fathers of the church seemed to believe that they had bodies: and this is certain, that their state and way of existence is unknown to us.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在此，请允许我提出我的一个奢侈的猜想，即：既然我们有一些理由（如果对我们的哲学无法解释的事情的报告有任何信任的话）来想象，精神可以把不同体积、身材和部分构造的身体变成自己的身体--他们中的一些人比我们有一个很大的优势，可能不在于此，他们可以这样为自己设计和塑造感觉或感知的器官，使它们适合于他们目前的设计和他们要考虑的对象的情况。因为，如果一个人有能力如此改变他的眼睛，即一种感官的结构，以使它能够具有所有几种程度的视觉，而眼镜的帮助（一开始是随便照的）已经教会了我们如何设想，那么这个人在知识方面会超过所有其他人？他能发现什么奇迹呢？他能使他的眼睛适应各种物体，以便在他高兴的时候看到动物血液和其他汁液中的微小颗粒的形状和运动，就像他在其他时候看到动物本身的形状和运动一样明显？但对我们来说，在我们目前的状态下，不可改变的器官，如此设计以发现身体微小部分的形状和运动，而我们现在在其中观察到的那些感性品质，可能没有任何好处。毫无疑问，上帝把它们设计成最适合我们目前状况的样子。他让我们与我们周围的身体相适应，而且我们必须与之打交道；尽管我们无法通过我们所拥有的能力达到对事物的完全了解，但它们将为我们的上述目的提供足够的服务，而这正是我们最关心的。请原谅我的读者在他面前提出关于我们之上的生命的感知方式的如此疯狂的幻想；但无论它是多么奢侈，我怀疑我们是否能想象到关于天使的知识，除了以这种方式，以某种方式或其他方式与我们在自己身上发现和观察到的相称。尽管我们不能不承认，上帝的无穷力量和智慧可能会在没有他们的情况下，用无数种其他的能力和方式来感知事物，而不是我们所拥有的，但我们的想法不能超越我们自己的想法：因此，我们不可能将我们的猜测扩大到从我们自己的感觉和思考中得到的想法之外。至少，关于天使有时会有身体的假设，不需要让我们吃惊；因为教会中一些最古老、最博学的教父似乎相信他们有身体：这一点是肯定的，他们的状态和存在方式对我们来说是未知的。</p>

These ideas of substances, though they are commonly simple apprehensions, and the names of them simple terms, yet in effect are complex and compounded. Thus the idea which an Englishman signifies by the name swan, is white colour, long neck, red beak, black legs, and whole feet, and all these of a certain size, with a power of swimming in the water, and making a certain kind of noise, and perhaps, to a man who has long observed this kind of birds, some other properties: which all terminate in sensible simple ideas, all united in one common subject.</p>

And thus, by putting together the ideas of thinking, perceiving, liberty, and power of moving themselves and other things, we have as clear a perception and notion of immaterial substances as we have of material. For putting together the ideas of thinking and willing, or the power of moving or quieting corporeal motion, joined to substance, of which we have no distinct idea, we have the idea of an immaterial spirit; and by putting together the ideas of coherent solid parts, and a power of being moved joined with substance, of which likewise we have no positive idea, we have the idea of matter. The one is as clear and distinct an idea as the other: the idea of thinking, and moving a body, being as clear and distinct ideas as the ideas of extension, solidity, and being moved. For our idea of substance is equally obscure, or none at all, in both: it is but a supposed I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents. It is for want of reflection that we are apt to think that our senses show us nothing but material things. Every act of sensation, when duly considered, gives us an equal view of both parts of nature, the corporeal and spiritual. For whilst I know, by seeing or hearing, &amp;c., that there is some corporeal being without me, the object of that sensation, I do more certainly know, that there is some spiritual being within me that sees and hears.

Nobody can imagine that his soul can think or move a body at Oxford, whilst he is at London; and cannot but know, that, being united to his body, it constantly changes place all the whole journey between Oxford and London, as the coach or horse does that carries him, and I think may be said to be truly all that while in motion or if that will not be allowed to afford us a clear idea enough of its motion, its being separated from the body in death, I think, will; for to consider it as going out of the body, or leaving it, and yet to have no idea of its motion, seems to me impossible.</p>

Further, if he says he knows not how he thinks, I answer, Neither knows he how he is extended, how the solid parts of body are united or cohere together to make extension. For though the pressure of the particles of air may account for the cohesion of several parts of matter that are grosser than the particles of air, and have pores less than the corpuscles of air, yet the weight or pressure of the air will not explain, nor can be a cause of the coherence of the particles of air themselves. And if the pressure of the aether, or any subtiler matter than the air, may unite, and hold fast together, the parts of a particle of air, as well as other bodies, yet it cannot make bonds for ITSELF, and hold together the parts that make up every the least corpuscle of that MATERIA SUBTILIS. So that that hypothesis, how ingeniously soever explained, by showing that the parts of sensible bodies are held together by the pressure of other external insensible bodies, reaches not the parts of the aether itself; and by how much the more evident it proves, that the parts of other bodies are held together by the external pressure of the aether, and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and union, by so much the more it leaves us in the dark concerning the cohesion of the parts of the corpuscles of the aether itself: which we can neither conceive without parts, they being bodies, and divisible, nor yet how their parts cohere, they wanting that cause of cohesion which is given of the cohesion of the parts of all other bodies.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">But, in truth, the pressure of any ambient fluid, how great soever, can be no intelligible cause of the cohesion of the solid parts of matter. For, though such a pressure may hinder the avulsion of two polished superficies, one from another, in a line perpendicular to them, as in the experiment of two polished marbles; yet it can never in the least hinder the separation by a motion, in a line parallel to those surfaces. Because the ambient fluid, having a full liberty to succeed in each point of space, deserted by a lateral motion, resists such a motion of bodies, so joined, no more than it would resist the motion of that body were it on all sides environed by that fluid, and touched no other body; and therefore, if there were no other cause of cohesion, all parts of bodies must be easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion. For if the pressure of the aether be the adequate cause of cohesion, wherever that cause operates not, there can be no cohesion. And since it cannot operate against a lateral separation, (as has been shown,) therefore in every imaginary plane, intersecting any mass of matter, there could be no more cohesion than of two polished surfaces, which will always, notwithstanding any imaginable pressure of a fluid, easily slide one from another. So that perhaps, how clear an idea soever we think we have of the extension of body, which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts, he that shall well consider it in his mind, may have reason to conclude, That it is as easy for him to have a clear idea how the soul thinks as how body is extended. For, since body is no further, nor otherwise, extended, than by the union and cohesion of its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the extension of body, without understanding wherein consists the union and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as incomprehensible as the manner of thinking, and how it is performed.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，事实上，任何环境流体的压力，无论有多大，都不可能成为物质的固体部分的凝聚力的可理解的原因。因为，尽管这种压力可能会阻碍两个抛光的表面在垂直于它们的线上的剥离，就像在两个抛光的大理石的实验中一样；但它绝对不能阻碍在平行于这些表面的线上通过运动而分离。因为周围的流体，在每一个空间点上都有充分的自由，被横向运动所遗弃，它对如此结合的物体的这种运动的抵制，不亚于它对该物体的运动的抵制，如果它四面都被该流体所包围，并且没有接触到其他物体的话；因此，如果没有其他的凝聚力的原因，物体的所有部分必须很容易被这种横向的滑动运动所分离。因为如果乙醚的压力是内聚力的充分原因，那么在该原因不发挥作用的地方，就不可能有内聚力。既然它不能对横向分离起作用，（正如已经表明的那样），因此在每一个假想的平面上，与任何质量的物质相交，不可能有比两个抛光的表面更多的凝聚力，尽管有任何可以想象的流体压力，它们总是很容易从另一个表面滑落。因此，无论我们认为自己对身体的延伸有多清楚的概念，也就是固体部分的凝聚力，只要在心里好好考虑一下，就有理由得出结论：对他来说，灵魂如何思考和身体如何延伸是一样容易的。因为，既然身体除了通过其固体部分的结合和凝聚之外，没有进一步的，也没有其他的延伸，如果不了解其部分的结合和凝聚是在哪里，我们就很难理解身体的延伸；在我看来，这和思考的方式以及如何进行思考一样，是不可理解的。</p>

These ideas, the one of body, the other of our minds, every day’s experience clearly furnishes us with: but if here again we inquire how this is done, we are equally in the dark. For, in the communication of motion by impulse, wherein as much motion is lost to one body as is got to the other, which is the ordinariest case, we can have no other conception, but of the passing of motion out of one body into another; which, I think, is as obscure and inconceivable as how our minds move or stop our bodies by thought, which we every moment find they do. The increase of motion by impulse, which is observed or believed sometimes to happen, is yet harder to be understood. We have by daily experience clear evidence of motion produced both by impulse and by thought; but the manner how, hardly comes within our comprehension: we are equally at a loss in both. So that, however we consider motion, and its communication, either from body or spirit, the idea which belongs to spirit is at least as clear as that which belongs to body. And if we consider the active power of moving, or, as I may call it, motivity, it is much clearer in spirit than body; since two bodies, placed by one another at rest, will never afford us the idea of a power in the one to move the other, but by a borrowed motion: whereas the mind every day affords us ideas of an active power of moving of bodies; and therefore it is worth our consideration, whether active power be not the proper attribute of spirits, and passive power of matter. Hence may be conjectured that created spirits are not totally separate from matter, because they are both active and passive. Pure spirit, viz. God, is only active; pure matter is only passive; those beings that are both active and passive, we may judge to partake of both. But be that as it will, I think, we have as many and as clear ideas belonging to spirit as we have belonging to body, the substance of each being equally unknown to us; and the idea of thinking in spirit, as clear as of extension in body; and the communication of motion by thought, which we attribute to spirit, is as evident as that by impulse, which we ascribe to body. Constant experience makes us sensible of both these, though our narrow understandings can comprehend neither. For, when the mind would look beyond those original ideas we have from sensation or reflection, and penetrate into their causes, and manner of production, we find still it discovers nothing but its own short-sightedness.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To conclude. Sensation convinces us that there are solid extended substances; and reflection, that there are thinking ones: experience assures us of the existence of such beings, and that the one hath a power to move body by impulse, the other by thought; this we cannot doubt of. Experience, I say, every moment furnishes us with the clear ideas both of the one and the other. But beyond these ideas, as received from their proper sources, our faculties will not reach. If we would inquire further into their nature, causes, and manner, we perceive not the nature of extension clearer than we do of thinking. If we would explain them any further, one is as easy as the other; and there is no more difficulty to conceive how A SUBSTANCE WE KNOW NOT should, by thought, set body into motion, than how A SUBSTANCE WE KNOW NOT should, by impulse, set body into motion. So that we are no more able to discover wherein the ideas belonging to body consist, than those belonging to spirit. From whence it seems probable to me, that the simple ideas we receive from sensation and reflection are the boundaries of our thoughts; beyond which the mind, whatever efforts it would make, is not able to advance one jot; nor can it make any discoveries, when it would pry into the nature and hidden causes of those ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">总结一下。感觉使我们相信存在着固体的延伸物质；反思使我们相信存在着思考的物质：经验使我们确信这些存在的存在，而且一个有能力通过冲动移动身体，另一个有能力通过思考移动身体；这一点我们不能怀疑。我说，经验每时每刻都在为我们提供关于一个和另一个的清晰概念。但是，在这些观念之外，从它们的适当来源得到的观念，我们的能力是无法达到的。如果我们要进一步探究它们的性质、原因和方式，我们对延伸的性质的认识不会比我们对思维的认识更清楚。如果我们要进一步解释它们，一个和另一个一样简单；要想象一个我们不知道的物质如何通过思想使身体运动，并不比一个我们不知道的物质如何通过冲动使身体运动更困难。因此，我们不可能发现属于身体的观念比属于精神的观念更重要。因此，在我看来，我们从感觉和思考中得到的简单观念是我们思想的界限；无论思想如何努力，都无法超越这个界限；当它想探究这些观念的性质和隐藏的原因时，也无法做出任何发现。</p>

Two primary qualities or properties of body, viz. solid coherent parts and impulse, we have distinct clear ideas of: so likewise we know, and have distinct clear ideas, of two primary qualities or properties of spirit, viz. thinking, and a power of action; i.e. a power of beginning or stopping several thoughts or motions. We have also the ideas of several qualities inherent in bodies, and have the clear distinct ideas of them; which qualities are but the various modifications of the extension of cohering solid parts, and their motion. We have likewise the ideas of the several modes of thinking viz. believing, doubting, intending, fearing, hoping; all which are but the several modes of thinking.

For I would fain have instanced anything in our notion of spirit more perplexed, or nearer a contradiction, than the very notion of body includes in it; the divisibility IN INFINITUM of any finite extension involving us, whether we grant or deny it, in consequences impossible to be explicated or made in our apprehensions consistent; consequences that carry greater difficulty, and more apparent absurdity, than anything can follow from the notion of an immaterial knowing substance.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">最后，如果这种非物质精神的概念可能有一些不容易解释的困难，那么我们就没有理由否认或怀疑这种精神的存在，就像我们没有理由否认或怀疑身体的存在一样；因为身体的概念充满了一些困难，也许我们无法解释或理解。因为我很想举例说明，在我们的精神概念中，有什么东西比身体的概念更令人困惑，或更接近于矛盾；任何有限的延伸的无限可分性，无论我们同意还是否认，都会使我们陷入无法解释的后果，或在我们的理解中变得一致；这些后果比从非物质的认识物质的概念中得出的任何结果都更困难，也更明显荒谬。</p>

And therefore experimenting and discovering in ourselves knowledge, and the power of voluntary motion, as certainly as we experiment, or discover in things without us, the cohesion and separation of solid parts, which is the extension and motion of bodies; we have as much reason to be satisfied with our notion of immaterial spirit, as with our notion of body, and the existence of the one as well as the other. For it being no more a contradiction that thinking should exist separate and independent from solidity, than it is a contradiction that solidity should exist separate and independent from thinking, they being both but simple ideas, independent one from another and having as clear and distinct ideas in us of thinking as of solidity, I know not why we may not as well allow a thinking thing without solidity, i.e. immaterial, to exist, as a solid thing without thinking, i.e. matter, to exist; especially since it is not harder to concieve how thinking should exist without matter, than how matter should think. For whensoever we would proceed beyond these simple ideas we have from sensation and reflection and dive further into the nature of things, we fall presently into darkness and obscurity, perplexedness and difficulties, and can discover nothing further but our own blindness and ignorance. But whichever of these complex ideas be clearest, that of body, or immaterial spirit, this is evident, that the simple ideas that make them up are no other than what we have received from sensation or reflection: and so is it of all our other ideas of substances, even of God himself.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这一点我们一点也不奇怪，因为我们对事物只有一些肤浅的概念，只是通过感官从外部发现的，或者通过头脑思考它在内部实验的东西，除此之外没有任何知识，更不用说对事物的内部结构和真正的性质了，因为我们缺乏达到这种目的的能力。因此，我们在自己身上实验和发现知识以及自愿运动的能力，就像我们在没有我们的事物中实验或发现固体部分的凝聚和分离一样，这就是身体的延伸和运动；我们有同样的理由对我们的非物质精神的概念感到满意，就像对我们的身体的概念一样，以及一个和另一个的存在一样。因为思维独立于实体而存在，并不比实体独立于思维而存在更矛盾，它们都是简单的观念，彼此独立，在我们心中对思维的观念和对实体的观念一样清晰明确，我不知道为什么我们不能允许一个没有实体的思维，即非物质的东西存在，就像一个没有思维的实体，即物质，存在一样；尤其是因为要想知道没有物质的思维如何存在，并不比物质如何思维更难。因为每当我们想超越我们从感觉和思考中得到的这些简单的想法，进一步深入了解事物的本质时，我们马上就会陷入黑暗和晦涩、困惑和困难之中，除了我们自己的盲目和无知之外，什么也发现不了。但是，无论这些复杂的观念中的哪一个最清楚，是身体的观念，还是非物质的精神，这都是显而易见的，构成它们的简单观念与我们从感觉或思考中得到的没有什么不同：我们对物质的所有其他观念也是如此，甚至对上帝本身也是如此。</p>

For that in our ideas, as well of spirits as of other things, we are restrained to THOSE WE RECEIVE FROM SENSATION AND REFLECTION, is evident from hence,—That, in our ideas of spirits, how much soever advanced in perfection beyond those of bodies, even to that of infinite, we cannot yet have any idea of the manner wherein they discover their thoughts one to another: though we must necessarily conclude that separate spirits, which are beings that have perfecter knowledge and greater happiness than we, must needs have also a perfecter way of communicating their thoughts than we have, who are fain to make use of corporeal signs, and particular sounds; which are therefore of most general use, as being the best and quickest we are capable of. But of immediate communication having no experiment in ourselves, and consequently no notion of it at all, we have no idea how spirits, which use not words, can with quickness; or much less how spirits that have no bodies can be masters of their own thoughts, and communicate or conceal them at pleasure, though we cannot but necessarily suppose they have such a power.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">还应注意的是，我们赋予上帝的任何观念，除了无限之外，都是我们关于其他精神的复杂观念的一部分。因为，除了那些我们通过思考从我们自己的思想运作中得到的想法外，我们没有其他简单的想法，属于身体以外的任何东西，除了我们从那里得到的想法外，我们不能把其他的想法归于精神：在我们对精神的思考中，我们可以把它们之间的所有区别，只在它们的知识、权力、持续时间、幸福等的几个范围和程度。因为在我们对精神和其他事物的观念中，我们只限于从感觉和反射中获得的观念，这一点从这里可以看出，在我们对精神的观念中，无论在完美程度上比身体的观念高出多少，甚至达到无限的程度，我们都不能对他们发现自己思想的方式有任何想法。尽管我们必须得出结论，独立的精神，即比我们有更完美的知识和更大的幸福的生命，也必须有比我们更完美的方式来交流他们的思想，因为我们喜欢利用肉体的迹象和特殊的声音；因此，这是最普遍的用途，因为这是我们所能做到的最好和最快速的。但是，由于在我们自己身上没有进行过试验，因此根本没有这方面的概念，我们不知道不用语言的精神如何能迅速地进行交流；更不知道没有身体的精神如何能成为自己思想的主人，并随心所欲地交流或隐瞒它们，尽管我们不能不假定它们有这种能力。</p>

<div class="top left">

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, That all the simple ideas, that thus united in one common SUBSTRATUM, make up our complex ideas of several SORTS of substances, are no other but such as we have received from sensation or reflection. So that even in those which we think we are most intimately acquainted with, and that come nearest the comprehension of our most enlarged conceptions, we cannot go beyond those simple ideas. And even in those which seem most remote from all we have to do with, and do infinitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reflection; or discover by sensation in other things, we can attain to nothing but those simple ideas, which we originally received from sensation or reflection; as is evident in the complex ideas we have of angels, and particularly of God himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，所有的简单概念，就这样在一个共同的结构中结合起来，构成了我们对各种物质的复杂概念，除了我们从感觉或思考中得到的那些概念外，没有其他的。因此，即使在那些我们认为我们最熟悉的，以及最接近我们最广泛的概念的理解的物质中，我们也不能超越这些简单的想法。甚至在那些看起来与我们所有的事物最相距甚远的事物中，也无限地超越了我们通过思考可以在自己身上感知到的东西；或者通过感觉在其他事物中发现的东西，我们除了从感觉或思考中得到的那些简单的观念外，什么也达不到；这在我们对天使，特别是对上帝本身的复杂观念中是很明显的。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thirdly, That most of the simple ideas that make up our complex ideas of substances, when truly considered, are only POWERS, however we are apt to take them for positive qualities; v.g. the greatest part of the ideas that make our complex idea of GOLD are yellowness, great weight, ductility, fusibility, and solubility in AQUA REGIA, &amp;c., all united together in an unknown SUBSTRATUM: all which ideas are nothing else but so many relations to other substances; and are not really in the gold, considered barely in itself, though they depend on those real and primary qualities of its internal constitution, whereby it has a fitness differently to operate, and be operated on by several other substances.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，构成我们对物质的复杂概念的大多数简单概念，在真正考虑时，只是一种力量，尽管我们很容易把它们当作积极的品质；例如，构成我们对黄金的复杂概念的最大部分是黄色、巨大的重量、延展性、可熔性和在水里的可溶性，等等。所有这些概念都是在一个未知的SUBSTRATUM中结合在一起的：所有这些概念都不是别的，而是与其他物质的许多关系；并不真正在黄金中，被认为是勉强在其本身中，尽管它们取决于其内部结构的那些真实和主要的品质，据此它有不同的适用性来操作，并被其他几种物质操作。</p>

And as the mind, by putting together the repeated ideas of unity, makes the collective mode, or complex idea, of any number, as a score, or a gross, &amp;c.,—so, by putting together several particular substances, it makes collective ideas of substances, as a troop, an army, a swarm, a city, a fleet; each of which every one finds that he represents to his own mind by one idea, in one view; and so under that notion considers those several things as perfectly one, as one ship, or one atom. Nor is it harder to conceive how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea than how a man should make one idea it being as easy to the mind to unite into one the idea of a great number of men, and consider it as one as it is to unite into one particular all the distinct ideas that make up the composition of a man, and consider them all together as one.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这些物质的集体观念，心灵通过其构成能力，将简单或复杂的观念分别结合为一体，正如它通过同样的能力，使特定物质的复杂观念，由多种简单观念的集合体组成，结合在一个物质中。就像心灵通过把重复的统一观念放在一起，形成任何数字的集体模式，或复杂的观念，如分数，或总数等等，同样，通过把几个特定的物质放在一起，形成物质的集体观念，如一支部队，一支军队，一群人，一个城市，一个舰队；每个人都发现他在自己的头脑中用一个观念表示，在一个视图中；所以在这个概念下，认为这几个东西是完全一样的，如一艘船，或一个原子。想象一支由一万人组成的军队如何形成一个观念，也不比想象一个人如何形成一个观念难，因为对心灵来说，将众多人的观念合二为一，并将其视为一个整体，就像将构成一个人的所有不同观念合二为一，并将它们视为一个整体一样容易。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">BESIDES the ideas, whether simple or complex, that the mind has of things as they are in themselves, there are others it gets from their comparison one with another. The understanding, in the consideration of anything, is not confined to that precise object: it can carry any idea as it were beyond itself, or at least look beyond it, to see how it stands in conformity to any other. When the mind so considers one thing, that it does as it were bring it to, and set it by another, and carries its view from one to the other—this is, as the words import, RELATION and RESPECT; and the denominations given to positive things, intimating that respect, and serving as marks to lead the thoughts beyond the subject itself denominated, to something distinct from it, are what we call RELATIVES; and the things so brought together, RELATED. Thus, when the mind considers Caius as such a positive being, it takes nothing into that idea but what really exists in Caius; v.g. when I consider him as a man, I have nothing in my mind but the complex idea of the species, man. So likewise, when I say Caius is a white man, I have nothing but the bare consideration of a man who hath that white colour. But when I give Caius the name HUSBAND, I intimate some other person; and when I give him the name WHITER, I intimate some other thing: in both cases my thought is led to something beyond Caius, and there are two things brought into consideration. And since any idea, whether simple or complex, may be the occasion why the mind thus brings two things together, and as it were takes a view of them at once, though still considered as distinct: therefore any of our ideas may be the foundation of relation. As in the above-mentioned instance, the contract and ceremony of marriage with Sempronia is the occasion of the denomination and relation of husband; and the colour white the occasion why he is said to be whiter than free-stone.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">除了心灵对事物本身所具有的简单或复杂的观念之外，还有一些观念是它从事物的相互比较中得到的。理解力在考虑任何事物时，并不局限于那个精确的对象：它可以把任何想法带到它自己之外，或者至少看它之外，看它如何与任何其他事物保持一致。当思想如此考虑一件事时，它就像把它带到另一件事上，并把它放在另一件事上，并把它的观点从一件事带到另一件事上--正如这句话的意思，这就是关系和尊重；而给予正面事物的名称，暗示着这种尊重，并作为标记，把思想从被称为主题本身引向与它不同的东西，就是我们所说的关系；而如此汇集的事物就是关系。因此，当心灵把凯厄斯看作是一个积极的存在时，除了凯厄斯身上真正存在的东西外，它没有把任何东西带入这个概念；例如，当我把他看作是一个人时，我的脑海中除了人这个物种的复杂概念外，没有任何东西。同样，当我说凯厄斯是一个白人时，我除了考虑到一个拥有白色的人之外，什么都没有。但是，当我给凯厄斯起名为丈夫时，我就想到了另一个人；当我给他起名为白人时，我就想到了另一件事：在这两种情况下，我的思想都被引向凯厄斯以外的东西，有两种东西被带入考虑。由于任何观念，不管是简单的还是复杂的，都可能成为心灵将两件事情结合在一起的契机，并且就像一下子看到了它们一样，虽然仍然被认为是不同的：因此我们的任何观念都可能成为关系的基础。在上述例子中，与Sempronia的婚姻契约和仪式是丈夫这一称谓和关系的原因；白色是他被称为比自由石更白的原因。</p>

For father and son, husband and wife, and such other correlative terms, seem so nearly to belong one to another, and, through custom, do so readily chime and answer one another in people’s memories, that, upon the naming of either of them, the thoughts are presently carried beyond the thing so named; and nobody overlooks or doubts of a relation, where it is so plainly intimated. But where languages have failed to give correlative names, there the relation is not always so easily taken notice of. CONCUBINE is, no doubt, a relative name, as well as wife: but in languages where this and the like words have not a correlative term, there people are not so apt to take them to be so, as wanting that evident mark of relation which is between correlatives, which seem to explain one another, and not to be able to exist, but together. Hence it is, that many of those names, which, duly considered, do include evident relations, have been called EXTERNAL DENOMINATIONS. But all names that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea, which is either in the thing to which the name is applied, and then it is positive, and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing to which the denomination is given; or else it arises from the respect the mind finds in it to something distinct from it, with which it considers it, and then it includes a relation.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">这些和类似的关系，用相对的术语来表达，这些术语有其他的回答，有相互的暗示，就像父亲和儿子，大和小，因和果，对每个人来说都是非常明显的，每个人一看到就能觉察到这种关系。因为父亲和儿子，丈夫和妻子，以及其他相关的术语，似乎几乎是属于彼此的，而且，通过习惯，在人们的记忆中如此容易地相互呼应，以至于在命名其中任何一个术语时，人们的想法很快就会超越所命名的事物；没有人忽视或怀疑一种关系，因为它是如此明确地暗示的。但在语言没有给出相关名称的地方，这种关系就不总是那么容易被注意到了。CONCUBINE无疑是一个相对的名字，也是一个妻子的名字：但在这个词和类似的词没有一个相关的术语的语言中，人们不那么容易认为它们是这样的，因为在相关词之间缺乏明显的关系标志，而这些相关词似乎可以解释彼此，不可能存在，但可以一起。因此，许多经过适当考虑，确实包括明显关系的名称，被称为外部名称。但是，所有不只是空洞的声音的名字都必须表示某种观念，这种观念要么存在于名字所适用的事物中，那么它就是积极的，被视为与被赋予名称的事物相联系并存在于其中；要么它产生于头脑中发现的对与它不同的事物的尊重，它用这种尊重来考虑它，那么它就包括一种关系。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, This further may be considered concerning relation, that though it be not contained in the real existence of things, but something extraneous and superinduced, yet the ideas which relative words stand for are often clearer and more distinct than of those substances to which they do belong. The notion we have of a father or brother is a great deal clearer and more distinct than that we have of a man; or, if you will, PATERNITY is a thing whereof it is easier to have a clear idea, than of HUMANITY; and I can much easier conceive what a friend is, than what God; because the knowledge of one action, or one simple idea, is oftentimes sufficient to give me the notion of a relation; but to the knowing of any substantial being, an accurate collection of sundry ideas is necessary. A man, if he compares two things together, can hardly be supposed not to know what it is wherein he compares them: so that when he compares any things together, he cannot but have a very clear idea of that relation. THE IDEAS, THEN, OF RELATIONS, ARE CAPABLE AT LEAST OF BEING MORE PERFECT AND DISTINCT IN OUR MINDS THAN THOSE OF SUBSTANCES. Because it is commonly hard to know all the simple ideas which are really in any substance, but for the most part easy enough to know the simple ideas that make up any relation I think on, or have a name for: v.g. comparing two men in reference to one common parent, it is very easy to frame the ideas of brothers, without having yet the perfect idea of a man. For significant relative words, as well as others, standing only for ideas; and those being all either simple, or made up of simple ones, it suffices for the knowing the precise idea the relative term stands for, to have a clear conception of that which is the foundation of the relation; which may be done without having a perfect and clear idea of the thing it is attributed to. Thus, having the notion that one laid the egg out of which the other was hatched, I have a clear idea of the relation of DAM and CHICK between the two cassiowaries in St. James’s Park; though perhaps I have but a very obscure and imperfect idea of those birds themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，关于关系，我们可以进一步考虑，虽然它不包含在事物的真实存在中，而是一些不相干的东西，但相对的词语所代表的概念往往比它们所属的那些物质更清楚、更明确。我们对父亲或兄弟的概念比对人的概念要清楚和明确得多；或者，如果你愿意的话，"父亲 "是一个比 "人类 "更容易有明确概念的东西；我更容易想象什么是朋友，而不是什么上帝；因为对一个行动或一个简单概念的了解，往往足以给我一个关系的概念；但要知道任何实质性的存在，必须准确收集各种概念。一个人如果把两件东西放在一起比较，很难说他不知道他把它们放在一起比较的是什么：因此，当他把任何东西放在一起比较时，他不能不对这种关系有一个非常清楚的概念。因此，在我们的头脑中，关系的观念至少能够比物质的观念更加完善和明确。因为通常很难知道任何物质中真正存在的所有简单概念，但在大多数情况下，却很容易知道构成我所思考的任何关系的简单概念，或有一个名称：例如，将两个人与一个共同的父母进行比较，很容易形成兄弟的概念，但还没有一个人的完美概念。对于重要的相对词，以及其他只代表观念的词；这些都是简单的，或由简单的词组成的，要知道相对词所代表的确切观念，只需对作为关系基础的东西有一个明确的概念；这可以在对它所归属的东西没有一个完美和明确的概念的情况下做到。因此，有了一个蛋是另一个蛋孵化出来的概念，我就对圣詹姆斯公园里的两只鸡之间的蛋和鸡的关系有了清晰的概念；尽管我对这些鸟儿本身的概念可能只是非常模糊和不完善。</p>

To clear this, I shall show it in the most considerable relations that we have any notion of; and in some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reflection: which yet will appear to have their ideas from thence, and leave it past doubt that the notions we have of them are but certain simple ideas, and so originally derived from sense or reflection.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，虽然有大量的考虑因素，可以将事物相互比较，因此有许多关系，但它们都以那些简单的观念为终点，并与之有关，无论是感觉还是思考，我认为这些观念是我们所有知识的全部材料。为了弄清这一点，我将在我们有任何概念的最重要的关系中表明这一点；在一些似乎与感觉或反思最遥远的关系中表明这一点：这些关系似乎从那里得到它们的观念，并使人毫不怀疑，我们对它们的观念只是某些简单的观念，因此最初来自感觉或反思。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">In the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of things, we cannot but observe that several particular, both qualities and substances, begin to exist; and that they receive this their existence from the due application and operation of some other being. From this observation we get our ideas of CAUSE and EFFECT. THAT WHICH PRODUCES ANY SIMPLE OR COMPLEX IDEA we denote by the general name, CAUSE, and THAT WHICH IS PRODUCED, EFFECT. Thus, finding that in that substance which we call wax, fluidity, which is a simple idea that was not in it before, is constantly produced by the application of a certain degree of heat we call the simple idea of heat, in relation to fluidity in wax, the cause of it, and fluidity the effect. So also, finding that the substance, wood, which is a certain collection of simple ideas so called, by the application of fire, is turned into another substance, called ashes; i. e., another complex idea, consisting of a collection of simple ideas, quite different from that complex idea which we call wood; we consider fire, in relation to ashes, as cause, and the ashes, as effect. So that whatever is considered by us to conduce or operate to the producing any particular simple idea, or collection of simple ideas, whether substance or mode, which did not before exist, hath thereby in our minds the relation of a cause, and so is denominated by us.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在我们的感官注意到事物的不断变化时，我们不能不观察到，一些特殊的东西，包括质量和物质，开始存在；它们从其他一些存在的适当应用和操作中获得这种存在。从这个观察中，我们得到了 "原因 "和 "结果 "的概念。产生任何简单或复杂概念的东西，我们用一般的名称 "原因 "来表示，而产生的东西则是 "结果"。因此，我们发现，在我们称之为蜡的物质中，流动性（这是一个以前不存在的简单概念）不断地通过施加一定程度的热量而产生，我们把与蜡的流动性有关的热的简单概念称为它的原因，而流动性是它的结果。同样，我们发现，木头这种物质，也就是所谓的简单观念的某种集合，通过火的应用，变成了另一种物质，叫做灰烬；也就是说，另一种复杂的观念，由简单观念的集合组成，与我们称之为木头的复杂观念完全不同；我们认为，火与灰烬的关系，是原因，而灰烬，是效果。因此，凡是被我们认为有助于产生任何特定的简单概念，或简单概念的集合，无论是物质还是模式，之前并不存在，因此在我们的头脑中具有原因的关系，所以被我们称为。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, When a thing is made up of particles, which did all of them before exist; but that very thing, so constituted of pre-existing particles, which, considered all together, make up such a collection of simple ideas, had not any existence before, as this man, this egg, rose, or cherry, &amp;c. And this, when referred to a substance, produced in the ordinary course of nature by internal principle, but set on work by, and received from, some external agent, or cause, and working by insensible ways which we perceive not, we call GENERATION. When the cause is extrinsical, and the effect produced by a sensible separation, or juxta-position of discernible parts, we call it MAKING; and such are all artificial things. When any simple idea is produced, which was not in that subject before, we call it ALTERATION. Thus a man is generated, a picture made; and either of them altered, when any new sensible quality or simple idea is produced in either of them, which was not there before: and the things thus made to exist, which were not there before, are effects; and those things which operated to the existence, causes. In which, and all other cases, we may observe, that the notion of cause and effect has its rise from ideas received by sensation or reflection; and that this relation, how comprehensive soever, terminates at last in them. For to have the idea of cause and effect, it suffices to consider any simple idea or substance, as beginning to exist, by the operation of some other, without knowing the manner of that operation.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，当一个事物是由颗粒组成的，而这些颗粒之前确实都存在；但那个由先前存在的颗粒组成的事物，从整体上看，构成了这样一个简单概念的集合，之前没有任何存在，就像这个人、这个鸡蛋、玫瑰或樱桃等等。而这一点，如果是指一种物质，在自然界的正常过程中由内部原理产生，但由某种外部制剂或原因开始工作，并通过我们无法察觉的方式发挥作用，我们称之为生成。当原因是外在的，而效果是通过可感知的分离或可识别的部分的联合定位产生的，我们称之为制造；这就是所有人造的东西。当任何简单的概念产生时，而这一概念之前并不存在于该主体中，我们称之为改变（ALTERATION）。因此，一个人被创造出来，一幅画被制作出来；当它们中的任何一个产生了以前没有的新的感性品质或简单概念时，它们中的任何一个都被改变了：这样被制造出来的、以前没有的东西是效果；而那些导致存在的东西是原因。在这种情况下，以及在所有其他情况下，我们可以看到，原因和结果的概念是从通过感觉或思考接受的观念中产生的；而且这种关系，无论多么全面，最后都会在它们中结束。因为要有因果的概念，只需把任何简单的观念或物质看作是通过某种其他的操作而开始存在的，而不知道这种操作的方式。</p>

Again, William the Conqueror invaded England about the year 1066; which means this, That, taking the duration from our Saviour’s time till now for one entire great length of time, it shows at what distance this invasion was from the two extremes; and so do all words of time answering to the question, WHEN, which show only the distance of any point of time from the period of a longer duration, from which we measure, and to which we thereby consider it as related.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">时间和地点也是非常大的关系的基础；至少所有有限的生命都与它们有关。但是，在另一个地方已经说明了我们是如何得到这些观念的，在此只需说明，从时间那里得到的大多数事物的名称都只是关系而已。因此，当有人说伊丽莎白女王活了69岁，在位45年时，这些话只是表示这个时间长度与其他时间长度的关系，而没有其他意思，只是说她存在的时间长度等于69岁，她执政的时间长度等于太阳每年转45圈；所有回答 "多长时间 "的词都是如此。同样，征服者威廉在1066年左右入侵英国；这意味着，从我们救世主的时代到现在的时间是一个完整的时间长度，它表明这次入侵离两个极端有多远；所有回答 "何时 "问题的时间词也是如此，它们只表明任何时间点离更长的时间段的距离，我们从这个时间段开始测量，并由此认为它与之相关。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">There are yet, besides those, other words of time, that ordinarily are thought to stand for positive ideas, which yet will, when considered, be found to be relative; such as are, young, old, &amp;c., which include and intimate the relation anything has to a certain length of duration, whereof we have the idea in our minds. Thus, having settled in our thoughts the idea of the ordinary duration of a man to be seventy years, when we say a man is YOUNG, we mean that his age is yet but a small part of that which usually men attain to; and when we denominate him OLD, we mean that his duration is ran out almost to the end of that which men do not usually exceed. And so it is but comparing the particular age or duration of this or that man, to the idea of that duration which we have in our minds, as ordinarily belonging to that sort of animals: which is plain in the application of these names to other things; for a man is called young at twenty years, and very young at seven years old: but yet a horse we call old at twenty, and a dog at seven years, because in each of these we compare their age to different ideas of duration, which are settled in our minds as belonging to these several sorts of animals, in the ordinary course of nature. But the sun and stars, though they have outlasted several generations of men, we call not old, because we do not know what period God hath set to that sort of beings. This term belonging properly to those things which we can observe in the ordinary course of things, by a natural decay, to come to an end in a certain period of time; and so have in our minds, as it were, a standard to which we can compare the several parts of their duration; and, by the relation they bear thereunto, call them young or old; which we cannot, therefore, do to a ruby or a diamond, things whose usual periods we know not.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">除了这些，还有其他的时间词，通常被认为是代表积极的想法，但在考虑时，会发现它们是相对的；例如，年轻、年老等等，它们包括并表明任何事物与一定的时间长度的关系，我们在头脑中就有这种想法。因此，在我们的思想中已经确定了一个人的正常期限是七十年，当我们说一个人年轻时，我们的意思是他的年龄还只是通常人达到的年龄的一小部分；而当我们称他为老人时，我们的意思是他的期限几乎已经到了人通常不超过的程度。因此，我们只是把这个人或那个人的特定年龄或期限与我们头脑中通常属于那类动物的期限概念相比较：这在这些名称对其他事物的应用中很明显；因为一个人在20岁时被称为年轻，在7岁时被称为非常年轻：但我们在20岁时称马为老，在7岁时称狗为老，因为在这些人中，我们把他们的年龄与我们头脑中属于这几种动物的不同期限概念相比较，在大自然的正常过程中，这些概念是固定的。但是，太阳和星星，尽管它们已经超过了几代人的寿命，我们却不称其为老，因为我们不知道上帝为这种生命设定了什么期限。这个词恰当地属于那些我们可以在事物的正常过程中观察到的，通过自然衰变，在一定时期内结束的事物；因此，在我们心中有一个标准，我们可以据此比较它们持续时间的几个部分；并根据它们与之的关系，称它们为年轻或衰老；因此，我们不能对红宝石或钻石这样做，它们的正常时期我们不知道。</p>

But as in duration, so in extension and bulk, there are some ideas that are relative which we signify by names that are thought positive; as GREAT and LITTLE are truly relations. For here also, having, by observation, settled in our minds the ideas of the bigness of several species of things from those we have been most accustomed to, we make them as it were the standards, whereby to denominate the bulk of others. Thus we call a great apple, such a one as is bigger than the ordinary sort of those we have been used to; and a little horse, such a one as comes not up to the size of that idea which we have in our minds to belong ordinarily to horses; and that will be a great horse to a Welchman, which is but a little one to a Fleming; they two having, from the different breed of their countries, taken several-sized ideas to which they compare, and in relation to which they denominate their great and their little.</p>

Thus, when we say a weak man, we mean one that has not so much strength or power to move as usually men have, or usually those of his size have; which is a comparing his strength to the idea we have of the usual strength of men, or men of such a size. The like when we say the creatures are all weak things; weak there is but a relative term, signifying the disproportion there is in the power of God and the creatures. And so abundance of words, in ordinary speech, stand only for relations (and perhaps the greatest part) which at first sight seem to have no such signification: v.g. the ship has necessary stores. NECESSARY and STORES are both relative words; one having a relation to the accomplishing the voyage intended, and the other to future use. All which relations, how they are confined to, and terminate in ideas derived from sensation or reflection, is too obvious to need any explication.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">同样，弱者和强者也只是力量的相对称谓，与我们当时对力量大小的一些想法相比较。因此，当我们说一个软弱的人时，我们指的是一个没有那么多力量或移动能力的人，通常男人都有，或通常像他这样体型的人都有；这是将他的力量与我们对男人或这样体型的人的通常力量的想法相比较。就像我们说受造物都是软弱的东西一样；软弱只是一个相对的术语，表示上帝的力量与受造物的力量不相称。因此，在普通话中，有很多词只代表关系（也许是最大的一部分），乍一看似乎没有这样的含义：例如，这艘船有必要的仓库。NECESSARY和STORES都是相对词；一个与完成预定的航程有关，另一个与未来的使用有关。所有这些关系，它们是如何局限于，并终止于来自感觉或思考的概念，是非常明显的，不需要任何解释。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">ANOTHER occasion the mind often takes of comparing, is the very being of things, when, considering ANYTHING AS EXISTING AT ANY DETERMINED TIME AND PLACE, we compare it with ITSELF EXISTING AT ANOTHER TIME, and thereon form the ideas of IDENTITY and DIVERSITY. When we see anything to be in any place in any instant of time, we are sure (be it what it will) that it is that very thing, and not another which at that same time exists in another place, how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respects: and in this consists IDENTITY, when the ideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that moment wherein we consider their former existence, and to which we compare the present. For we never finding, nor conceiving it possible, that two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the same time, we rightly conclude, that, whatever exists anywhere at any time, excludes all of the same kind, and is there itself alone. When therefore we demand whether anything be the SAME or no, it refers always to something that existed such a time in such a place, which it was certain, at that instant, was the same with itself, and no other. From whence it follows, that one thing cannot have two beginnings of existence, nor two things one beginning; it being impossible for two things of the same kind to be or exist in the same instant, in the very same place; or one and the same thing in different places. That, therefore, that had one beginning, is the same thing; and that which had a different beginning in time and place from that, is not the same, but diverse. That which has made the difficulty about this relation has been the little care and attention used in having precise notions of the things to which it is attributed.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">心灵经常进行比较的另一个场合是事物的存在，当我们认为任何事物存在于任何确定的时间和地点时，我们将它与存在于另一个时间的它自己进行比较，并由此形成了同一性和多样性的概念。当我们看到任何东西在任何时间的任何地方，我们确信（不管它是什么）它就是那个东西，而不是在同一时间存在于另一个地方的另一个东西，不管它在所有其他方面是多么的相似和没有区别：在这一点上包括同一性，当它所归属的观念与我们考虑它们以前存在的那个时刻完全不一样，而我们与现在的观念相比较。因为我们从来没有发现，也不认为有可能有两样东西同时存在于同一个地方，所以我们正确地得出结论，任何时候存在于任何地方的东西，都排除了所有同类的东西，而只存在于那里。因此，当我们问及任何东西是否相同时，它总是指在某个时间、某个地点存在的东西，在那一瞬间，它肯定是与自己相同的，而不是其他。由此可见，一个事物不可能有两个存在的开端，两个事物也不可能有一个开端；同类的两个事物不可能在同一时刻、同一地点出现或存在；或者同一事物在不同的地方出现。因此，有一个开始的东西是同一个东西；而在时间和地点上与之不同的开始，则不是同一个，而是不同的。造成这种关系困难的原因是，在对它所归属的事物有精确的概念时，没有注意和关注。</p>

For example: could two bodies be in the same place at the same time; then those two parcels of matter must be one and the same, take them great or little; nay, all bodies must be one and the same. For, by the same reason that two particles of matter may be in one place, all bodies may be in one place: which, when it can be supposed, takes away the distinction of identity and diversity of one and more, and renders it ridiculous.

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">From what has been said, it is easy to discover what is so much inquired after, the PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS; and that, it is plain, is existence itself; which determines a being of any sort to a particular time and place, incommunicable to two beings of the same kind. This, though it seems easier to conceive in simple substances or modes; yet, when reflected on, is not more difficult in compound ones, if care be taken to what it is applied: v.g. let us suppose an atom, i.e. a continued body under one immutable superficies, existing in a determined time and place; it is evident, that, considered in any instant of its existence, it is in that instant the same with itself. For, being at that instant what it is, and nothing else, it is the same, and so must continue as long as its existence is continued; for so long it will be the same, and no other. In like manner, if two or more atoms be joined together into the same mass, every one of those atoms will be the same, by the foregoing rule: and whilst they exist united together, the mass, consisting of the same atoms, must be the same mass, or the same body, let the parts be ever so differently jumbled. But if one of these atoms be taken away, or one new one added, it is no longer the same mass or the same body. In the state of living creatures, their identity depends not on a mass of the same particles, but on something else. For in them the variation of great parcels of matter alters not the identity: an oak growing from a plant to a great tree, and then lopped, is still the same oak; and a colt grown up to a horse, sometimes fat, sometimes lean, is all the while the same horse: though, in both these cases, there may be a manifest change of the parts; so that truly they are not either of them the same masses of matter, though they be truly one of them the same oak, and the other the same horse. The reason whereof is, that, in these two cases—a MASS OF MATTER and a LIVING BODY—identity is not applied to the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">从上面所说的，我们很容易发现人们所追问的东西，即 "基本原理"（PRINCIPIUM INDIVIDUATIONIS）；很明显，这就是存在本身；它决定了任何种类的存在在一个特定的时间和地点，对同类的两个存在来说是不可沟通的。这一点，虽然在简单的物质或模式中似乎更容易想象；但是，当反思时，如果注意它的应用，在复合物质中也不会更困难：例如，让我们假设一个原子，即在一个不变的表面下的持续的身体，存在于一个确定的时间和地点；很明显，在其存在的任何瞬间考虑，它在那一瞬间与自己是一样的。因为，在那一瞬间，它是它自己，而不是别的什么，它是一样的，所以只要它的存在继续下去，它就必须继续下去；因为只要它是一样的，而不是别的。同样，如果两个或更多的原子结合在一起成为同一个质量，根据上述规则，这些原子中的每一个都将是相同的：当它们结合在一起时，由相同的原子组成的质量必须是相同的质量，或者说是相同的身体，尽管各部分的组合是如此不同的。但是，如果这些原子被拿走一个，或增加一个新的，它就不再是相同的质量或相同的身体。在生物的状态下，它们的特性不是取决于相同粒子的质量，而是取决于其他东西。因为在它们身上，大块物质的变化不会改变它们的特性：一棵橡树从植物长成大树，然后被砍掉，仍然是同一棵橡树；一匹小马长成马，有时肥，有时瘦，一直是同一匹马：尽管在这两种情况下，各部分可能有明显的变化；因此，它们确实不是它们中的任何一块物质，尽管它们确实一个是同一棵橡树，另一个是同一匹马。其原因是，在这两种情况下--物质团和活体--同一性并没有应用于同一事物。</p>

That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant, in a like continued organization conformable to that sort of plants. For this organization, being at any one instant in any one collection of matter, is in that particular concrete distinguished from all other, and IS that individual life, which existing constantly from that moment both forwards and backwards, in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding parts united to the living body of the plant, it has that identity which makes the same plant, and all the parts of it, parts of the same plant, during all the time that they exist united in that continued organization, which is fit to convey that common life to all the parts so united.</p>

It is plain it is nothing but a fit organization or construction of parts to a certain end, which, when a sufficient force is added to it, it is capable to attain. If we would suppose this machine one continued body, all whose organized parts were repaired, increased, or diminished by a constant addition or separation of insensible parts, with one common life, we should have something very much like the body of an animal; with this difference, That, in an animal the fitness of the organization, and the motion wherein life consists, begin together, the motion coming from within; but in machines the force coming sensibly from without, is often away when the organ is in order, and well fitted to receive it.</p>

For if the identity of SOUL ALONE makes the same MAN; and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same individual spirit may not be united to different bodies, it will be possible that those men, living in distant ages, and of different tempers, may have been the same man: which way of speaking must be from a very strange use of the word man, applied to an idea out of which body and shape are excluded. And that way of speaking would agree yet worse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of transmigration, and are of opinion that the souls of men may, for their miscarriages, be detruded into the bodies of beasts, as fit habitations, with organs suited to the satisfaction of their brutal inclinations.

		<p class="calibre5 en">It is not therefore unity of substance that comprehends all sorts of identity, or will determine it in every case; but to conceive and judge of it aright, we must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for: it being one thing to be the same SUBSTANCE, another the same MAN, and a third the same PERSON, if PERSON, MAN, and SUBSTANCE, are three names standing for three different ideas;—for such as is the idea belonging to that name, such must be the identity; which, if it had been a little more carefully attended to, would possibly have prevented a great deal of that confusion which often occurs about this matter, with no small seeming difficulties, especially concerning PERSONAL identity, which therefore we shall in the next place a little consider.</p>

Since I think I may be confident, that, whoever should see a creature of his own shape or make, though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot, would call him still a MAN; or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot discourse, reason, and philosophize, would call or think it nothing but a CAT or a PARROT; and say, the one was a dull irrational man, and the other a very intelligent rational parrot.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">This being premised, to find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what PERSON stands for;—which, I think, is a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking, and, as it seems to me, essential to it: it being impossible for any one to perceive without PERCEIVING that he does perceive. When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate, or will anything, we know that we do so. Thus it is always as to our present sensations and perceptions: and by this every one is to himself that which he calls SELF:—it not being considered, in this case, whether the same self be continued in the same or divers substances. For, since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self, and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things, in this alone consists personal identity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being: and as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now it was then; and it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that action was done.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在此前提下，为了找到个人身份的所在，我们必须考虑人代表什么；我认为，人是一种有思想的智慧生物，它有理性和反思，并能在不同的时间和地点将自己视为自己，即同一个有思想的东西；它只有通过那种与思想密不可分的意识才能做到，而且在我看来，这种意识是必不可少的：任何人都不可能在没有感知到自己确实有感知的情况下感知。当我们看到、听到、闻到、尝到、感觉到、冥想或意愿任何东西时，我们知道我们这样做了。因此，对于我们现在的感觉和知觉来说，情况总是如此：每个人对自己来说都是他所谓的 "自我"：在这种情况下，并不考虑同一自我是否在同一或不同的物质中继续存在。因为，既然意识总是伴随着思考，而且它使每个人成为他所谓的自我，从而将自己与所有其他有思想的东西区分开来，那么，只有在这一点上才包括个人身份，即理性存在的同一性：只要这种意识可以向后延伸到任何过去的行动或思想，就可以达到那个人的身份；现在是同一个自我，当时也是；而且，现在对它进行反思的这个自我是同一个，那个行动也是由它完成。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">But it is further inquired, whether it be the same identical substance. This few would think they had reason to doubt of, if these perceptions, with their consciousness, always remained present in the mind, whereby the same thinking thing would be always consciously present, and, as would be thought, evidently the same to itself. But that which seems to make the difficulty is this, that this consciousness being interrupted always by forgetfulness, there being no moment of our lives wherein we have the whole train of all our past actions before our eyes in one view, but even the best memories losing the sight of one part whilst they are viewing another; and we sometimes, and that the greatest part of our lives, not reflecting on our past selves, being intent on our present thoughts, and in sound sleep having no thoughts at all, or at least none with that consciousness which remarks our waking thoughts,—I say, in all these cases, our consciousness being interrupted, and we losing the sight of our past selves, doubts are raised whether we are the same thinking thing, i.e. the same SUBSTANCE or no. Which, however reasonable or unreasonable, concerns not PERSONAL identity at all. The question being what makes the same person; and not whether it be the same identical substance, which always thinks in the same person, which, in this case, matters not at all: different substances, by the same consciousness (where they do partake in it) being united into one person, as well as different bodies by the same life are united into one animal, whose identity is preserved in that change of substances by the unity of one continued life. For, it being the same consciousness that makes a man be himself to himself, personal identity depends on that only, whether it be annexed solely to one individual substance, or can be continued in a succession of several substances. For as far as any intelligent being CAN repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present action; so far it is the same personal self. For it is by the consciousness it has of its present thoughts and actions, that it is SELF TO ITSELF now, and so will be the same self, as far as the same consciousness can extend to actions past or to come; and would be by distance of time, or change of substance, no more two persons, than a man be two men by wearing other clothes to-day than he did yesterday, with a long or a short sleep between: the same consciousness uniting those distant actions into the same person, whatever substances contributed to their production.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但人们进一步询问，它是否是相同的物质。很少有人会认为他们有理由怀疑这一点，如果这些知觉，连同它们的意识，始终存在于头脑中的话，那么同一个思维的东西就会始终有意识地存在，而且，正如人们所认为的那样，对它自己来说显然是一样的。但是，似乎造成困难的是，这种意识总是被遗忘所打断，在我们的生活中，没有任何一个时刻，我们可以在眼前看到我们过去所有行为的全部过程，但即使是最好的记忆，也会在看到另一个部分时，失去对它的看法。我们有时，而且是我们生命中最重要的部分，不反思我们过去的自己，而是专注于我们现在的想法，在酣睡中根本没有想法，或者至少没有意识到我们清醒时的想法，--我说，在所有这些情况下，我们的意识被打断，我们失去了对我们过去的自己的看法，人们怀疑我们是否是同一个思考的东西，即。即，是否是同一个物质。这不管是合理的还是不合理的，都与个人的身份无关。问题是什么造就了同一个人；而不是是否是相同的物质，它总是在同一个人中思考，在这种情况下，这根本不重要：不同的物质，通过相同的意识（在它们确实参与其中的地方）被结合成一个人，就像不同的身体通过相同的生命被结合成一个动物一样，它们的身份在物质的变化中通过一个持续的生命的统一性得到保留。因为，是同一个意识使人成为他自己，个人的身份只取决于这一点，无论它是完全附属于一个单独的物质，还是可以在几个物质的连续中继续存在。因为只要任何智能体能以它最初对任何过去行为的相同意识来重复任何过去行为的观念，并以它对任何现在行为的相同意识来重复；到目前为止，它就是同一个人的自我。因为正是由于它对它现在的思想和行动的意识，它现在才是自己，所以它将是同一个自己，只要同一个意识能够延伸到过去或未来的行动；而且由于时间的距离或物质的变化，它将是两个人，就像一个人今天穿的衣服和昨天穿的衣服不同，中间睡了很久或很短，也不会是两个人：同一个意识将这些遥远的行动结合成同一个人，不管这些物质对它们的产生有什么作用。</p>

Thus, the limbs of his body are to every one a part of himself; he sympathizes and is concerned for them. Cut off a hand, and thereby separate it from that consciousness he had of its heat, cold, and other affections, and it is then no longer a part of that which is himself, any more than the remotest part of matter. Thus, we see the SUBSTANCE whereof personal self consisted at one time may be varied at another, without the change of personal identity; there being no question about the same person, though the limbs which but now were a part of it, be cut off.</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">And to this I answer: First, This can be no question at all to those who place thought in a purely material animal constitution, void of an immaterial substance. For, whether their supposition be true or no, it is plain they conceive personal identity preserved in something else than identity of substance; as animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance. And therefore those who place thinking in an immaterial substance only, before they can come to deal with these men, must show why personal identity cannot be preserved in the change of immaterial substances, or variety of particular immaterial substances, as well as animal identity is preserved in the change of material substances, or variety of particular bodies: unless they will say, it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same life in brutes, as it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same person in men; which the Cartesians at least will not admit, for fear of making brutes thinking things too.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">对此，我的回答是。首先，对于那些将思想置于纯物质的动物构造中，没有非物质的物质的人来说，这根本就不是问题。因为，不管他们的假设是真是假，很明显，他们把个人的特性保存在物质的特性之外；就像动物的特性保存在生命的特性，而不是物质的特性。因此，那些只把思维放在非物质的物质中的人，在处理这些人之前，必须说明为什么个人身份不能在非物质的物质的变化或特定非物质的种类中得到保存，就像动物身份在物质的物质的变化或特定身体的种类中得到保存一样：除非他们会说，是一个非物质的精神在畜生中创造了同样的生命，就像是一个非物质的精神在人中创造了同样的人；至少笛卡尔派不会承认这一点，因为他们害怕把畜生也变成思维的东西。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">But next, as to the first part of the question, Whether, if the same thinking substance (supposing immaterial substances only to think) be changed, it can be the same person? I answer, that cannot be resolved but by those who know there can what kind of substances they are that do think; and whether the consciousness of past actions can be transferred from one thinking substance to another. I grant were the same consciousness the same individual action it could not: but it being a present representation of a past action, why it may not be possible, that that may be represented to the mind to have been which really never was, will remain to be shown. And therefore how far the consciousness of past actions is annexed to any individual agent, so that another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine, till we know what kind of action it is that cannot be done without a reflex act of perception accompanying it, and how performed by thinking substances, who cannot think without being conscious of it. But that which we call the same consciousness, not being the same individual act, why one intellectual substance may not have represented to it, as done by itself, what IT never did, and was perhaps done by some other agent—why, I say, such a representation may not possibly be without reality of matter of fact, as well as several representations in dreams are, which yet whilst dreaming we take for true—will be difficult to conclude from the nature of things. And that it never is so, will by us, till we have clearer views of the nature of thinking substances, be best resolved into the goodness of God; who, as far as the happiness or misery of any of his sensible creatures is concerned in it, will not, by a fatal error of theirs, transfer from one to another that consciousness which draws reward or punishment with it. How far this may be an argument against those who would place thinking in a system of fleeting animal spirits, I leave to be considered. But yet, to return to the question before us, it must be allowed, that, if the same consciousness (which, as has been shown, is quite a different thing from the same numerical figure or motion in body) can be transferred from one thinking substance to another, it will be possible that two thinking substances may make but one person. For the same consciousness being preserved, whether in the same or different substances, the personal identity is preserved.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">但接下来，对于问题的第一部分，如果同一思维物质（假定非物质的物质只有思维）被改变，它是否能成为同一个人？我回答说，这个问题不能解决，只能由那些知道有思维的物质是什么类型的人解决；以及过去行为的意识是否可以从一个有思维的物质转移到另一个。我承认，如果同一个意识是同一个单独的行动，它就不可能：但它是过去行动的现在的表象，为什么不可能，因为它可能在头脑中表象为已经存在，而实际上从未存在，这将有待于证明。因此，对过去行动的意识在多大程度上附属于任何个体代理人，以致另一个人不可能有这种意识，我们将很难确定，直到我们知道什么样的行动是在没有伴随感知的反射行为的情况下无法完成的，以及如何由有思想的物质执行的，他们不能在没有意识的情况下思考。但是，我们称之为相同的意识，并不是相同的个人行为，为什么一个智力物质不可能向它表示，它自己做了什么，而IT从来没有做过，也许是由其他代理人做的--我说，为什么这种表示不可能没有事实的真实性，就像梦中的一些表示一样，但在梦中我们却认为是真实的--从事物的本质来看，很难得出结论。在我们对思维物质的性质有了更清楚的认识之前，我们将最好地解决上帝的仁慈；就他的任何一个有感觉的生物的幸福或痛苦而言，他不会因为他们的一个致命的错误，把那个引来奖励或惩罚的意识从一个人转移到另一个人身上。这在多大程度上可以成为反对那些将思维置于短暂的动物精神系统中的人的论据，我留待考虑。但是，回到我们面前的问题，我们必须承认，如果同样的意识（正如已经表明的那样，它与同样的数字或身体的运动是完全不同的）可以从一个思维物质转移到另一个，那么两个思维物质就有可能构成一个人。因为无论在同一或不同的物质中，同样的意识被保留下来，个人的身份也被保留下来。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">As to the second part of the question, Whether the same immaterial substance remaining, there may be two distinct persons; which question seems to me to be built on this,—Whether the same immaterial being, being conscious of the action of its past duration, may be wholly stripped of all the consciousness of its past existence, and lose it beyond the power of ever retrieving it again: and so as it were beginning a new account from a new period, have a consciousness that CANNOT reach beyond this new state. All those who hold pre-existence are evidently of this mind; since they allow the soul to have no remaining consciousness of what it did in that pre-existent state, either wholly separate from body, or informing any other body; and if they should not, it is plain experience would be against them. So that personal identity, reaching no further than consciousness reaches, a pre-existent spirit not having continued so many ages in a state of silence, must needs make different persons. Suppose a Christian Platonist or a Pythagorean should, upon God’s having ended all his works of creation the seventh day, think his soul hath existed ever since; and should imagine it has revolved in several human bodies; as I once met with one, who was persuaded his had been the SOUL of Socrates (how reasonably I will not dispute; this I know, that in the post he filled, which was no inconsiderable one, he passed for a very rational man, and the press has shown that he wanted not parts or learning;)—would any one say, that he, being not conscious of any of Socrates’s actions or thoughts, could be the same PERSON with Socrates? Let any one reflect upon himself, and conclude that he has in himself an immaterial spirit, which is that which thinks in him, and, in the constant change of his body keeps him the same: and is that which he calls HIMSELF: let his also suppose it to be the same soul that was in Nestor or Thersites, at the siege of Troy, (for souls being, as far as we know anything of them, in their nature indifferent to any parcel of matter, the supposition has no apparent absurdity in it,) which it may have been, as well as it is now the soul of any other man: but he now having no consciousness of any of the actions either of Nestor or Thersites, does or can he conceive himself the same person with either of them? Can he be concerned in either of their actions? attribute them to himself, or think them his own more than the actions of any other men that ever existed? So that this consciousness, not reaching to any of the actions of either of those men, he is no more one SELF with either of them than of the soul of immaterial spirit that now informs him had been created, and began to exist, when it began to inform his present body; though it were never so true, that the same SPIRIT that informed Nestor’s or Thersites’ body were numerically the same that now informs his. For this would no more make him the same person with Nestor, than if some of the particles of smaller that were once a part of Nestor were now a part of this man the same immaterial substance, without the same consciousness, no more making the same person, by being united to any body, than the same particle of matter, without consciousness, united to any body, makes the same person. But let him once find himself conscious of any of the actions of Nestor, he then finds himself the same person with Nestor.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">至于问题的第二部分，即同一非物质物质是否仍然存在，是否会有两个不同的人；在我看来，这个问题是建立在这样的基础上的，即同一非物质存在，在意识到其过去的持续时间的情况下，是否会完全被剥夺其过去存在的所有意识，并失去它，永远无法再次找回它：因此，就像它从一个新的时期开始一个新的帐户，有一个意识，不能达到这个新状态之外。所有持先存论的人显然都有这种想法；因为他们允许灵魂对它在先存状态下所做的事情没有剩余的意识，要么完全脱离身体，要么告知任何其他身体；如果他们不应该这样做，显然经验会对他们不利。因此，个人的身份，没有达到意识所能达到的程度，一个先存的精神没有在沉默的状态下持续这么多的时间，必须要有不同的人。假设一个基督教的柏拉图主义者或毕达哥拉斯主义者，在上帝于第七天结束了他的所有创造工作之后，认为他的灵魂一直存在；并想象它曾在几个人的身体里旋转；正如我曾经遇到的一个人，他相信他的灵魂是苏格拉底的灵魂（如何合理我不争论。我知道，在他所担任的职位上，他是一个非常理性的人，而且新闻界已经表明，他不需要任何部分或学习；）--有人会说，他没有意识到苏格拉底的任何行为或思想，可能与苏格拉底是同一个人吗？让任何一个人反省自己，并得出结论，他在自己身上有一个非物质的精神，这就是在他身上思考的东西，并且在他的身体不断变化中保持不变：这就是他所说的自己。让他也假设它是围攻特洛伊时在内斯特或瑟希特体内的同一个灵魂，（因为就我们对灵魂的了解而言，灵魂在本质上对任何物质包裹都是无动于衷的，这个假设没有明显的荒谬之处），它可能是这样的，就像它现在是任何其他人的灵魂一样：但他现在对内斯特或瑟希特的任何行为都没有意识，他是否或能否认为自己与他们中的任何一个是同一个人？他能与他们中的任何一个人的行为有关吗？把它们归于自己，或者认为它们是他自己的，比任何其他存在过的人的行为更多？因此，这种意识不涉及这些人中任何一个人的行为，他与他们中的任何一个人都不是一个自己，就像现在通知他的非物质精神的灵魂被创造出来，并开始存在，当它开始通知他现在的身体时；尽管从来没有这样的事实，即通知内斯特或瑟希特的身体的同一精神在数量上与现在通知他的相同。因为这不会使他与内斯特成为同一个人，就像曾经是内斯特的一部分的一些较小的粒子现在是这个人的一部分一样，同样的非物质物质，没有同样的意识，与任何身体结合起来也不会成为同一个人，就像同样的物质粒子，没有意识，与任何身体结合起来也会成为同一个人。但如果他一旦发现自己意识到内斯特的任何行为，他就会发现自己与内斯特是同一个人。</p>

For should the soul of a prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the prince’s past life, enter and inform the body of a cobbler, as soon as deserted by his own soul, every one sees he would be the same PERSON with the prince, accountable only for the prince’s actions: but who would say it was the same MAN? The body too goes to the making the man, and would, I guess, to everybody determine the man in this case, wherein the soul, with all its princely thoughts about it, would not make another man: but he would be the same cobbler to every one besides himself. I know that, in the ordinary way of speaking, the same person, and the same man, stand for one and the same thing. And indeed every one will always have a liberty to speak as he pleases, and to apply what articulate sounds to what ideas he thinks fit, and change them as often as he pleases.

Thus every one finds that, whilst comprehended under that consciousness, the little finger is as much a part of himself as what is most so. Upon separation of this little finger, should this consciousness go along with the little finger, and leave the rest of the body, it is evident the little finger would be the person, the same person; and self then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body. As in this case it is the consciousness that goes along with the substance, when one part is separate from another, which makes the same person, and constitutes this inseparable self: so it is in reference to substances remote in time. That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing CAN join itself, makes the same person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to itself, and owns all the actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no further; as every one who reflects will perceive.</p>

And thus, by this consciousness he finds himself to be the same self which did such and such an action some years since, by which he comes to be happy or miserable now. In all which account of self, the same numerical SUBSTANCE is not considered a making the same self; but the same continued CONSCIOUSNESS, in which several substances may have been united, and again separated from it, which, whilst they continued in a vital union with that wherein this consciousness then resided, made a part of that same self. Thus any part of our bodies, vitally united to that which is conscious in us, makes a part of ourselves: but upon separation from the vital union by which that consciousness is communicated, that which a moment since was part of ourselves, is now no more so than a part of another man’s self is a part of me: and it is not impossible but in a little time may become a real part of another person. And so we have the same numerical substance become a part of two different persons; and the same person preserved under the change of various substances. Could we suppose any spirit wholly stripped of all its memory of consciousness of past actions, as we find our minds always are of a great part of ours, and sometimes of them all; the union or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no variation of personal identity, any more than that of any particle of matter does.

This personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness,—whereby it becomes concerned and accountable; owns and imputes to itself past actions, just upon the same ground and for the same reason as it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of pleasure and pain, desiring that that self that is conscious should be happy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or APPROPRIATE to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action, is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all. For, supposing a MAN punished now for what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and being CREATED miserable? And therefore, conformable to this, the apostle tells us, that, at the great day, when every one shall ‘receive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.’ The sentence shall be justified by the consciousness all persons shall have, that THEY THEMSELVES, in what bodies soever they appear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the SAME that committed those actions, and deserve that punishment for them.</p>

Did we know what it was; or how it was tied to a certain system of fleeting animal spirits; or whether it could or could not perform its operations of thinking and memory out of a body organized as ours is; and whether it has pleased God that no one such spirit shall ever be united to any but one such body, upon the right constitution of whose organs its memory should depend; we might see the absurdity of some of those suppositions I have made. But taking, as we ordinarily now do (in the dark concerning these matters,) the soul of a man for an immaterial substance, independent from matter, and indifferent alike to it all; there can, from the nature of things, be no absurdity at all to suppose that the same SOUL may at different times be united to different BODIES, and with them make up for that time one MAN: as well as we suppose a part of a sheep’s body yesterday should be a part of a man’s body to-morrow, and in that union make a vital part of Meliboeus himself, as well as it did of his ram.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我有足够的理由认为，在处理这个问题时，我做了一些假设，这些假设在一些读者看来很奇怪，可能它们本身就是如此。但是，我认为这些假设是可以原谅的，因为我们对存在于我们体内的、被我们视为自己的那个有思想的东西的性质一无所知。如果我们知道它是什么；或者它是如何与某个转瞬即逝的动物精神系统联系在一起的；或者它是否可以或不可以在像我们这样组织起来的身体中执行其思维和记忆的操作；以及上帝是否高兴，没有一个这样的精神将永远与任何一个这样的身体结合在一起，而它的记忆应取决于其器官的正确构造；我们可能会看到我所做的一些假设的荒谬性。但是，正如我们现在通常所做的那样（在有关这些问题的黑暗中），把人的灵魂看作是一种非物质的物质，它独立于物质，并且对所有物质都无动于衷；从事物的性质来看，假设同一个灵魂在不同的时间与不同的身体结合，并与它们一起构成一个人，这一点一点都不荒唐。就像我们假设昨天羊身体的一部分明天会成为人身体的一部分，并在这种结合中成为Meliboeus本人的重要部分，就像它与公羊的结合一样。</p>

Whereby it will appear, that the difficulty or obscurity that has been about this matter rather rises from the names ill-used, than from any obscurity in things themselves.

But if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of parts in a certain shape; as long as that vital union and shape remain in a concrete, no otherwise the same but by a continued succession of fleeting particles, it will be the SAME MAN.

		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, Another occasion of comparing things together, or considering one thing, so as to include in that consideration some other thing, is the circumstances of their origin or beginning; which being not afterwards to be altered, make the relations depending thereon as lasting as the subjects to which they belong, v.g. father and son, brothers, cousin-germans, &amp;c., which have their relations by one community of blood, wherein they partake in several degrees: countrymen, i.e. those who were born in the same country or tract of ground; and these I call NATURAL RELATIONS: wherein we may observe, that mankind have fitted their notions and words to the use of common life, and not to the truth and extent of things. For it is certain, that, in reality, the relation is the same betwixt the begetter and the begotten, in the several races of other animals as well as men; but yet it is seldom said, this bull is the grandfather of such a calf, or that two pigeons are cousin-germans. It is very convenient that, by distinct names, these relations should be observed and marked out in mankind, there being occasion, both in laws and other communications one with another, to mention and take notice of men under these relations: from whence also arise the obligations of several duties amongst men: whereas, in brutes, men having very little or no cause to mind these relations, they have not thought fit to give them distinct and peculiar names. This, by the way, may give us some light into the different state and growth of languages; which being suited only to the convenience of communication, are proportioned to the notions men have, and the commerce of thoughts familiar amongst them; and not to the reality or extent of things, nor to the various respects might be found among them; nor the different abstract considerations might be framed about them. Where they had no philosophical notions, there they had no terms to express them: and it is no wonder men should have framed no names for those things they found no occasion to discourse of. From whence it is easy to imagine why, as in some countries, they may have not so much as the name for a horse; and in others, where they are more careful of the pedigrees of their horses, than of their own, that there they may have not only names for particular horses, but also of their several relations of kindred one to another.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，将事物放在一起比较，或考虑一件事，以便将另一件事也包括在内的另一种情况，是它们的起源或开始的情况；由于这些情况以后不会改变，使由此产生的关系与它们所属的主体一样持久，例如，父亲和儿子、兄弟、堂兄弟等等。乡亲，即那些出生在同一个国家或同一片土地上的人；这些我称之为自然关系：在这里我们可以看到，人类将他们的概念和语言与普通生活的使用相适应，而不是与事物的真相和范围相适应。因为可以肯定的是，实际上，在其他动物和人的几个种族中，生者和被生者之间的关系是相同的；但却很少有人说，这头公牛是这只小牛的祖父，或者两只鸽子是表兄弟。在人类中，用不同的名称来观察和标明这些关系是非常方便的，因为在法律和其他相互之间的交流中，都有机会提到和注意到处于这些关系下的人：因此也就产生了人与人之间的几种义务：而在畜生身上，人们很少或没有理由注意到这些关系，他们认为不应该给它们起不同的和特殊的名称。顺便说一下，这可能会给我们一些启示，让我们了解语言的不同状况和发展；这些语言只适合于交流的方便，与人的概念和他们之间熟悉的思想交流相称；而不是与事物的现实或程度相称，也不是与它们之间可能存在的各种方面相称，也不是与可能对它们进行的不同的抽象考虑相称。在他们没有哲学概念的地方，他们没有术语来表达它们：难怪人们没有为那些他们没有机会讨论的事物起名字。因此，我们很容易想象，为什么在一些国家，他们可能连一匹马的名字都没有；而在另一些国家，他们对马的血统比对自己的血统更加谨慎，在那里，他们不仅有特定马的名字，而且还有它们之间的几种亲缘关系。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thirdly, Sometimes the foundation of considering things with reference to one another, is some act whereby any one comes by a moral right, power, or obligation to do something. Thus, a general is one that hath power to command an army, and an army under a general is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man. A citizen, or a burgher, is one who has a right to certain privileges in this or that place, All this sort depending upon men’s wills, or agreement in society, I call INSTITUTED, or VOLUNTARY; and may be distinguished from the natural, in that they are most, if not all of them, some way or other alterable, and separable from the persons to whom they have sometimes belonged, though neither of the substances, so related, be destroyed. Now, though these are all reciprocal, as well as the rest, and contain in them a reference of two things one to the other; yet, because one of the two things often wants a relative name, importing that reference, men usually take no notice of it, and the relation is commonly overlooked: v. g. a patron and client are easily allowed to be relations, but a constable or dictator are not so readily at first hearing considered as such. Because there is no peculiar name for those who are under the command of a dictator or constable, expressing a relation to either of them; though it be certain that either of them hath a certain power over some others, and so is so far related to them, as well as a patron is to his client, or general to his army.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，有时考虑事物相互关系的基础是一些行为，在这些行为中，任何人都有道德上的权利、权力或义务来做某事。因此，将军是有权力指挥军队的人，而将军手下的军队是由必须服从一个人的武装人员组成的。所有这类取决于人的意志或社会中的协议的人，我都称之为法定的或自愿的；并且可以与自然的区分开来，因为它们大多数（如果不是全部）都可以以某种方式改变，并且可以与它们有时所属的人分开，尽管如此相关的物质都不会被破坏。现在，虽然这些都是相互的，也和其他的一样，包含了两个事物之间的关系；但是，由于这两个事物中的一个常常需要一个相对的名字，来表示这种关系，人们通常不会注意到它，而且这种关系通常被忽略了：例如，赞助人和客户很容易被认为是关系，但是警员和独裁者一听就不那么容易被认为是这种关系。因为对于那些听命于独裁者或捕快的人来说，没有一个特殊的名字来表达与他们中任何一个人的关系；尽管可以肯定的是，他们中的任何一个人对其他一些人都有一定的权力，因此与他们的关系就像赞助人与他的客户，或将军与他的军队一样。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Fourthly, There is another sort of relation, which is the conformity or disagreement men’s VOLUNTARY ACTIONS have to a RULE to which they are referred, and by which they are judged of; which, I think, may be called MORAL RELATION, as being that which denominates our moral actions, and deserves well to be examined; there being no part of knowledge wherein we should be more careful to get determined ideas, and avoid, as much as may be, obscurity and confusion. Human actions, when with their various ends, objects, manners, and circumstances, they are framed into distinct complex ideas, are, as has been shown, so many MIXED MODES, a great part whereof have names annexed to them. Thus, supposing gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return kindness received; polygamy to be the having more wives than one at once: when we frame these notions thus in our minds, we have there so many determined ideas of mixed modes. But this is not all that concerns our actions: it is not enough to have determined ideas of them, and to know what names belong to such and such combinations of ideas. We have a further and greater concernment, and that is, to know whether such actions, so made up, are morally good or bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第四，还有一种关系，即人们的自愿行为是否符合某种规则，并据此对其进行评判；我认为，这种关系可称为道德关系，因为它是指我们的道德行为，很值得研究；在知识的任何部分，我们都应该更加小心地获得确定的概念，并尽可能地避免模糊和混乱的情况。人类的行为，当它们有不同的目的、对象、方式和环境时，它们被纳入不同的复杂概念中，正如已经表明的那样，是许多混合的模式，其中很大一部分都有名字附在它们身上。因此，假设感激是指愿意承认和回报所受的恩惠；一夫多妻制是指同时拥有多个妻子：当我们在头脑中这样构建这些概念时，我们就有了这么多混合模式的坚定想法。但这并不是我们行为的全部：仅仅有确定的观念，知道这样那样的观念组合属于什么名称，还不够。我们还有一个更重要的关注点，那就是要知道这样构成的行为在道德上是好是坏。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Of these moral rules or laws, to which men generally refer, and by which they judge of the rectitude or gravity of their actions, there seem to me to be THREE SORTS, with their three different enforcements, or rewards and punishments. For, since it would be utterly in vain to suppose a rule set to the free actions of men, without annexing to it some enforcement of good and evil to determine his will, we must, wherever we suppose a law, suppose also some reward or punishment annexed to that law. It would be in vain for one intelligent being to set a rule to the actions of another, if he had it not in his power to reward the compliance with, and punish deviation from his rule, by some good and evil, that is not the natural product and consequence of the action itself. For that, being a natural convenience or inconvenience, would operate of itself, without a law. This, if I mistake not, is the true nature of all law, properly so called.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在这些道德规则或法律中，人们通常会参考这些规则或法律，并据此判断他们行为的正确性或严重性，在我看来，有三种类型，有三种不同的执行方式，或奖励和惩罚。因为，既然假设为人的自由行动制定了一个规则，而不附加一些善恶的执行力来决定他的意志，那就完全是徒劳的，我们必须在我们假设有法律的地方，也假设有一些奖励或惩罚附加在这个法律上。如果一个聪明人没有能力通过某种善恶来奖励对他的规则的遵守和惩罚对他的规则的偏离，那么他为另一个人的行动制定规则也是徒劳的，而这并不是行动本身的自然产物和结果。因为那是一种自然的便利或不便，它本身就可以运作，不需要法律。如果我没有弄错的话，这就是所有法律的真正性质，也就是所谓的法律。</p>

That God has given a rule whereby men should govern themselves, I think there is nobody so brutish as to deny. He has a right to do it; we are his creatures: he has goodness and wisdom to direct our actions to that which is best: and he has power to enforce it by rewards and punishments of infinite weight and duration in another life; for nobody can take us out of his hands. This is the only true touchstone of moral rectitude; and, by comparing them to this law, it is that men judge of the most considerable moral good or evil of their actions; that is, whether, as duties or sins, they are like to procure them happiness or misery from the hands of the ALMIGHTY.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，神圣的法律，即上帝为人的行为制定的法律，不管是通过自然之光，还是通过启示之声颁布给他们。我想，没有人能够如此粗鲁地否认上帝给了人们一个管理自己的规则。他有权利这样做；我们是他的受造物：他有仁慈和智慧将我们的行为引向最好的方向：他有能力在另一个生命中通过无限重量和持续时间的奖励和惩罚来执行它；因为没有人可以把我们从他的手中夺走。这是衡量道德正确性的唯一真正的试金石；通过与这一法律相比较，人们可以判断他们的行为在道德上最重要的善恶；也就是说，作为义务或罪过，他们是否会从全能者手中获得幸福或痛苦。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Thirdly, the LAW OF OPINION OR REPUTATION. Virtue and vice are names pretended and supposed everywhere to stand for actions in their own nature right and wrong: and as far as they really are so applied, they so far are coincident with the divine law above mentioned. But yet, whatever is pretended, this is visible, that these names, virtue and vice, in the particular instances of their application, through the several nations and societies of men in the world, are constantly attributed only to such actions as in each country and society are in reputation or discredit. Nor is it to be thought strange, that men everywhere should give the name of virtue to those actions, which amongst them are judged praiseworthy; and call that vice, which they account blamable: since otherwise they would condemn themselves, if they should think anything right, to which they allowed not commendation, anything wrong, which they let pass without blame. Thus the measure of what is everywhere called and esteemed virtue and vice is this approbation or dislike, praise or blame, which, by a secret and tacit consent, establishes itself in the several societies, tribes, and clubs of men in the world: whereby several actions come to find credit or disgrace amongst them, according to the judgment, maxims, or fashion of that place. For, though men uniting into politic societies, have resigned up to the public the disposing of all their force, so that they cannot employ it against any fellow-citizens any further than the law of the country directs: yet they retain still the power of thinking well or ill, approving or disapproving of the actions of those whom they live amongst, and converse with: and by this approbation and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they will call virtue and vice.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，意见或声誉的法律。美德和恶习这两个名字在任何地方都被假装和假定为代表其本身性质上的正确和错误的行为：只要它们真的被如此应用，它们就与上述的神圣法律相吻合。但是，无论假装如何，有一点是显而易见的，那就是这些名称，即美德和恶习，在其应用的具体实例中，通过世界上的几个国家和人类社会，不断地只被归因于在每个国家和社会中享有声誉或不享有声誉的行为。这也不奇怪，人们会把那些在他们中间被认为是值得赞扬的行为称为美德，而把他们认为应受指责的行为称为恶习：因为如果他们认为有什么事情是正确的，而他们不允许赞扬，有什么事情是错误的，而他们不加指责的话，他们就会谴责自己了。因此，衡量各地所谓的美德和恶习的标准就是这种认可或厌恶、赞美或指责，它通过一种秘密和默契，在世界的几个社团、部落和人的俱乐部中建立起来，从而使一些行为在他们中间根据那个地方的判断、格言或时尚，找到信用或耻辱。因为，尽管人们联合起来组成政治团体，把他们所有的力量都交给了公众，使他们不能在国家法律规定的范围内对任何同胞使用武力，但他们仍然保留着对那些与他们生活在一起并与之交谈的人的行为进行思考的权力：通过这种赞许和厌恶，他们在自己中间建立了所谓的美德和罪恶。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">That this is the common MEASURE of virtue and vice, will appear to any one who considers, that, though that passes for vice in one country which is counted a virtue, or at least not vice, in another, yet everywhere virtue and praise, vice and blame, go together. Virtue is everywhere, that which is thought praiseworthy; and nothing else but that which has the allowance of public esteem is called virtue. Virtue and praise are so united, that they are called often by the same name. Sunt sua praemia laudi, says Virgil; and so Cicero, Nihil habet natura praestantius, quam honestatem, quam laudem, quam dignitatem, quam decus, which he tells you are all names for the same thing. This is the language of the heathen philosophers, who well understood wherein their notions of virtue and vice consisted. And though perhaps, by the different temper, education, fashion, maxims, or interest of different sorts of men, it fell out, that what was thought praiseworthy in one place, escaped not censure in another; and so in different societies, virtues and vices were changed; yet, as to the main, they for the most part kept the same everywhere. For, since nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation that wherein every one finds his advantage, and to blame and discountenance the contrary; it is no wonder that esteem and discredit, virtue and vice, should, in a great measure, everywhere correspond with the unchangeable rule of right and wrong, which the law of God hath established; there being nothing that so directly and visible secures and advances the general good of mankind in this world, as obedience to the laws he had set them, and nothing that breeds such mischiefs and confusion, as the neglect of them. And therefore men, without renouncing all sense and reason, and their own interest, which they are so constantly true to, could not generally mistake, in placing their commendation and blame on that side that really deserved it not. Nay, even those men whose practice was otherwise, failed not to give their approbation right, few being depraved to that degree as not to condemn, at least in others, the faults they themselves were guilty of; whereby, even in the corruption of manners, the true boundaries of the law of nature, which ought to be the rule of virtue and vice, were pretty well preferred. So that even the exhortations of inspired teachers, have not feared to appeal to common repute: ‘Whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,’ &amp;c. (Phil. iv. 8.)</p>

The penalties that attend the breach of God’s laws some, nay perhaps most men, seldom seriously reflect on: and amongst those that do, many, whilst they break the law, entertain thoughts of future reconciliation, and making their peace for such breaches. And as to the punishments due from the laws of the commonwealth, they frequently flatter themselves with the hopes of impunity. But no man escapes the punishment of their censure and dislike, who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he keeps, and would recommend himself to. Nor is there one of ten thousand, who is stiff and insensible enough, to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of his own club. He must be of a strange and unusual constitution, who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society. Solitude many men have sought, and been reconciled to: but nobody that has the least thought or sense of a man about him, can live in society under the constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars, and those he converses with. This is a burden too heavy for human sufferance: and he must be made up of irreconcileable contradictions, who can take pleasure in company, and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from his companions.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Whether the rule to which, as to a touchstone, we bring our voluntary actions, to examine them by, and try their goodness, and accordingly to name them, which is, as it were, the mark of the value we set upon them: whether, I say, we take that rule from the fashion of the country, or the will of a law-maker, the mind is easily able to observe the relation any action hath to it, and to judge whether the action agrees or disagrees with the rule; and so hath a notion of moral goodness or evil, which is either conformity or not conformity of any action to that rule: and therefore is often called moral rectitude. This rule being nothing but a collection of several simple ideas, the conformity thereto is but so ordering the action, that the simple ideas belonging to it may correspond to those which the law requires. And thus we see how moral beings and notions are founded on, and terminated in, these simple ideas we have received from sensation or reflection. For example: let us consider the complex idea we signify by the word murder: and when we have taken it asunder, and examined all the particulars, we shall find them to amount to a collection of simple ideas derived from reflection or sensation, viz. First, from REFLECTION on the operations of our own minds, we have the ideas of willing, considering, purposing beforehand, malice, or wishing ill to another; and also of life, or perception, and self-motion. Secondly, from SENSATION we have the collection of those simple sensible ideas which are to be found in a man, and of some action, whereby we put an end to perception and motion in the man; all which simple ideas are comprehended in the word murder. This collection of simple ideas, being found by me to agree or disagree with the esteem of the country I have been bred in, and to be held by most men there worthy praise or blame, I call the action virtuous or vicious: if I have the will of a supreme invisible Lawgiver for my rule, then, as I supposed the action commanded or forbidden by God, I call it good or evil, sin or duty: and if I compare it to the civil law, the rule made by the legislative power of the country, I call it lawful or unlawful, a crime or no crime. So that whencesoever we take the rule of moral actions; or by what standard soever we frame in our minds the ideas of virtues or vices, they consist only, and are made up of collections of simple ideas, which we originally received from sense or reflection: and their rectitude or obliquity consists in the agreement or disagreement with those patterns prescribed by some law.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们是否像试金石一样，把我们的自愿行动带到一个规则面前，用它来检验它们，测试它们的好坏，并相应地给它们命名，这就好比是我们对它们的价值的标志。我说，无论我们从国家的时尚，还是从法律制定者的意志中获取这一规则，人们都能很容易地观察到任何行动与它的关系，并判断该行动是否符合或不符合这一规则；因此有一个道德善恶的概念，即任何行动符合或不符合这一规则：因此通常被称为道德的正确性。这条规则不过是几个简单概念的集合，与之相符合不过是如此安排行动，使属于它的简单概念与法律所要求的相一致。因此，我们看到，道德的存在和观念是如何建立在我们从感觉或思考中得到的这些简单的观念上，并以这些观念为终点。例如：让我们考虑一下我们用谋杀这个词来表示的复杂概念：当我们把它拆开，检查所有的细节时，我们会发现它们相当于从反思或感觉中得到的简单概念的集合，即：第一，从对我们自己的思想活动的反思中，我们有了愿意、考虑、事先打算、恶意或希望对他人不利的概念；还有生命、或感知和自我运动。其次，从 "感觉"（SENSATION）中，我们得到了在人身上发现的那些简单的感性观念的集合，以及一些行动，通过这些行动我们结束了人身上的感觉和运动；所有这些简单的观念都包含在谋杀这个词中。这一系列简单的观念，被我发现与我所生长的国家的尊重相一致或不一致，并被那里的大多数人认为值得赞扬或指责，我就把这种行为称为良性或恶性。如果我有一个至高无上的无形的法律赋予者的意志作为我的规则，那么，由于我认为这个行为是由上帝命令或禁止的，我称它为善或恶，罪或责任：如果我把它与民法，即由国家立法权制定的规则相比，我称它为合法或非法，犯罪或无罪。因此，无论我们采取什么样的道德行动规则；或者无论我们以什么样的标准在我们的头脑中形成美德或恶行的观念，它们都只是由我们最初从感觉或思考中得到的简单观念的集合构成的：它们的正确性或错误性在于与某些法律规定的模式的一致或不一致。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">To conceive rightly of moral actions, we must take notice of them under this two-fold consideration. First, as they are in themselves, each made up of such a collection of simple ideas. Thus drunkenness, or lying, signify such or such a collection of simple ideas, which I call mixed modes: and in this sense they are as much POSITIVE ABSOLUTE ideas, as the drinking of a horse, or speaking of a parrot. Secondly, our actions are considered as good, bad, or indifferent; and in this respect they are RELATIVE, it being their conformity to, or disagreement with some rule that makes them to be regular or irregular, good or bad; and so, as far as they are compared with a rule, and thereupon denominated, they come under relation. Thus the challenging and fighting with a man, as it is a certain positive mode, or particular sort of action, by particular ideas, distinguished from all others, is called DUELLING: which, when considered in relation to the law of God, will deserve the name of sin; to the law of fashion, in some countries, valour and virtue; and to the municipal laws of some governments, a capital crime. In this case, when the positive mode has one name, and another name as it stands in relation to the law, the distinction may as easily be observed as it is in substances, where one name, v.g. MAN, is used to signify the thing; another, v.g. FATHER, to signify the relation.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">为了正确地设想道德行为，我们必须在这种两方面的考虑下注意它们。首先，就它们本身而言，每一个都是由这样的简单观念的集合组成的。因此，醉酒或说谎，意味着这样或那样的简单观念的集合，我称之为混合模式：在这个意义上，它们与马的饮酒或鹦鹉的说话一样，都是积极的绝对观念。第二，我们的行为被认为是好的、坏的或无所谓的；在这方面，它们是相对的，因为它们符合或不符合某种规则，使它们成为有规律的或无规律的、好的或坏的；因此，只要它们与某种规则相比较，并因此而被命名，它们就属于关系。因此，与人挑战和争斗，因为它是某种积极的方式，或特定的行动种类，通过特定的想法，区别于所有其他的行动，被称为斗殴：当考虑到与上帝的法律的关系时，它将值得被称为罪；在一些国家，与时尚的法律，英勇和美德；以及与一些政府的市政法律，是一种死刑。在这种情况下，当积极的模式有一个名字，而另一个名字是与法律有关的，这种区别可以像在物质中一样容易被观察到，在物质中，一个名字，如人，被用来表示事物；另一个名字，如父亲，表示关系。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">But because very frequently the positive idea of the action, and its moral relation, are comprehended together under one name, and the same word made use of to express both the mode or action, and its moral rectitude or obliquity: therefore the relation itself is less taken notice of; and there is often no distinction made between the positive idea of the action, and the reference it has to a rule. By which confusion of these two distinct considerations under one term, those who yield too easily to the impressions of sounds, and are forward to take names for things, are often misled in their judgment of actions. Thus, the taking from another what is his, without his knowledge or allowance, is properly called STEALING: but that name, being commonly understood to signify also the moral gravity of the action, and to denote its contrariety to the law, men are apt to condemn whatever they hear called stealing, as an ill action, disagreeing with the rule of right. And yet the private taking away his sword from a madman, to prevent his doing mischief, though it be properly denominated stealing, as the name of such a mixed mode; yet when compared to the law of God, and considered in its relation to that supreme rule, it is no sin or transgression, though the name stealing ordinarily carries such an intimation with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，由于行动的积极理念和它的道德关系经常被包含在一个名称之下，并且用同一个词来表达行动的方式或行动，以及它在道德上的正确性或不正确性：因此，关系本身较少被注意到；在行动的积极理念和它对规则的参照之间经常没有区别。由于将这两种不同的考虑混淆在一个术语之下，那些太容易屈服于声音的印象，并急于为事物取名的人，在对行动的判断上常常被误导。因此，在别人不知情或不允许的情况下，从他那里拿走属于他的东西，正确的叫法是偷窃：但这个名字通常被理解为也意味着该行为的道德严重性，并表示它与法律相抵触，因此人们很容易谴责他们听到的任何被称为偷窃的行为，认为它是一种不良行为，与权利规则不一致。然而，私人从一个疯子手中夺走他的剑，以防止他做坏事，虽然它被正确地称为偷窃，作为这种混合方式的名称；但当与上帝的法律相比，并从它与那个最高规则的关系来看，它不是罪或违法行为，尽管偷窃这个名称通常带有这种暗示。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, That it is evident, that all relation terminates in, and is ultimately founded on, those simple ideas we have got from sensation or reflection: so that all we have in our thoughts ourselves, (if we think of anything, or have any meaning,) or would signify to others, when we use words standing for relations, is nothing but some simple ideas, or collections of simple ideas, compared one with another. This is so manifest in that sort called proportional, that nothing can be more. For when a man says ‘honey is sweeter than wax,’ it is plain that his thoughts in this relation terminate in this simple idea, sweetness; which is equally true of all the rest: though, where they are compounded, or decompounded, the simple ideas they are made up of, are, perhaps, seldom taken notice of: v.g. when the word father is mentioned: first, there is meant that particular species, or collective idea, signified by the word man; secondly, those sensible simple ideas, signified by the word generation; and, thirdly, the effects of it, and all the simple ideas signified by the word child. So the word friend, being taken for a man who loves and is ready to do good to another, has all these following ideas to the making of it up: first, all the simple ideas, comprehended in the word man, or intelligent being; secondly, the idea of love; thirdly, the idea of readiness or disposition; fourthly, the idea of action, which is any kind of thought or motion; fifthly, the idea of good, which signifies anything that may advance his happiness, and terminates at last, if examined, in particular simple ideas, of which the word good in general signifies any one; but, if removed from all simple ideas quite, it signifies nothing at all. And thus also all moral words terminate at last, though perhaps more remotely, in a collection of simple ideas: the immediate signification of relative words, being very often other supposed known relations; which, if traced one to another, still end in simple ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，显而易见的是，所有的关系都以我们从感觉或思考中得到的那些简单的观念为终点，并最终建立在这些观念之上：因此，当我们使用代表关系的词语时，我们自己在思想中所拥有的（如果我们想到任何东西，或有任何意义，）或将向他人表示的，只不过是一些简单的观念，或简单观念的集合，彼此比较。这在那种被称为比例的东西中是如此明显，没有什么比这更重要的了。因为当一个人说'蜂蜜比蜡更甜'时，很明显，他的思想在这种关系中终止于这个简单的概念--甜；这对所有其他的东西来说也是一样的：尽管在它们被复合或反复合的地方，它们所组成的简单概念，也许很少被注意到：V.当提到父亲这个词时：首先，是指人这个词所代表的特定种类或集体观念；其次，是指代词所代表的那些感性的简单观念；第三，是指代词的效果，以及孩子这个词所代表的所有简单观念。因此，"朋友 "一词被认为是一个热爱并愿意为他人做好事的人，它的构成有以下所有的观念。第一，所有简单的概念，包括在人这个词中，或智慧的存在；第二，爱的概念；第三，准备或倾向的概念；第四，行动的概念，这是任何一种思想或运动；第五，善的概念，这意味着任何可能促进他的幸福，最后终止，如果检查，在特定的简单概念，其中，善这个词一般表示任何一个；但是，如果从所有的简单概念完全删除，它表示什么都没有。因此，所有的道德词汇最后也都终止于简单概念的集合，尽管可能更遥远：相对词汇的直接含义，往往是其他假定的已知关系；如果逐一追踪，仍然终止于简单概念。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, That in relations, we have for the most part, if not always, as clear a notion of THE RELATION as we have of THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WHEREIN IT IS FOUNDED: agreement or disagreement, whereon relation depends, being things whereof we have commonly as clear ideas as of any other whatsoever; it being but the distinguishing simple ideas, or their degrees one from another, without which we could have no distinct knowledge at all. For, if I have a clear idea of sweetness, light, or extension, I have, too, of equal, or more, or less, of each of these: if I know what it is for one man to be born of a woman, viz. Sempronia, I know what it is for another man to be born of the same woman Sempronia; and so have as clear a notion of brothers as of births, and perhaps clearer. For if I believed that Sempronia digged Titus out of the parsley-bed, (as they used to tell children,) and thereby became his mother; and that afterwards, in the same manner, she digged Caius out of the parsley-bed, I had as clear a notion of the relation of brothers between them, as if I had all the skill of a midwife: the notion that the same woman contributed, as mother, equally to their births, (though I were ignorant or mistaken in the manner of it,) being that on which I grounded the relation; and that they agreed in the circumstance of birth, let it be what it will. The comparing them then in their descent from the same person, without knowing the particular circumstances of that descent, is enough to found my notion of their having, or not having, the relation of brothers. But though the ideas of PARTICULAR RELATIONS are capable of being as clear and distinct in the minds of those who will duly consider them as those of mixed modes, and more determinate than those of substances: yet the names belonging to relation are often of as doubtful and uncertain signification as those of substances or mixed modes; and much more than those of simple ideas. Because relative words, being the marks of this comparison, which is made only by men’s thoughts, and is an idea only in men’s minds, men frequently apply them to different comparisons of things, according to their own imaginations; which do not always correspond with those of others using the same name.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，在关系中，我们对关系的大部分概念，如果不是总是这样的话，就像我们对关系所依据的那些简单概念一样清楚：关系所依赖的一致或不一致，是我们通常对任何其他东西都有清楚的概念的东西；它只是简单概念的区分，或者它们彼此的程度，没有它，我们根本不可能有明确的知识。因为，如果我对甜味、光亮或延伸有清晰的概念，我也对其中的每一种都有相同的、更多的或更少的概念：如果我知道一个男人由一个女人（即桑普罗尼亚）所生是什么，我也知道另一个男人由同一个女人桑普罗尼亚所生是什么；因此，我对兄弟的概念和对出生的概念一样清晰，也许更清晰。因为如果我相信桑普罗尼亚把提图斯从欧芹床里挖出来，（就像他们过去对孩子们说的那样），从而成为他的母亲；后来，她又以同样的方式把凯厄斯从欧芹床里挖出来，我对他们之间的兄弟关系就有了清晰的概念，就像我有助产士的所有技能。同一个女人作为母亲对他们的出生做出了同样的贡献，（尽管我对其方式不了解或有误），这是我建立这种关系的基础；他们在出生的情况上是一致的，不管它是什么。在不知道他们的血缘关系的情况下，把他们从同一个人那里比较出来，就足以证明他们有或没有兄弟关系的概念。但是，尽管特殊关系的概念在那些愿意适当考虑它们的人的头脑中能够像混合模式的概念一样清晰和明确，而且比物质的概念更加确定：但是属于关系的名称往往像物质或混合模式的名称一样具有可疑和不确定的意义；而且比简单概念的名称更加可疑。因为相对的词语是这种比较的标志，而这种比较只是由人的思想作出的，而且只是人头脑中的一种观念，所以人经常根据自己的想象，把它们应用于事物的不同比较；而这种想象并不总是与使用同一名称的其他人的想象相符。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">The perception of the mind being most aptly explained by words relating to the sight, we shall best understand what is meant by CLEAR and OBSCURE in our ideas, by reflecting on what we call clear and obscure in the objects of sight. Light being that which discovers to us visible objects, we give the name of OBSCURE to that which is not placed in a light sufficient to discover minutely to us the figure and colours which are observable in it, and which, in a better light, would be discernible. In like manner, our simple ideas are CLEAR, when they are such as the objects themselves from whence they were taken did or might, in a well-ordered sensation or perception, present them. Whilst the memory retains them thus, and can produce them to the mind whenever it has occasion to consider them, they are clear ideas. So far as they either want anything of the original exactness, or have lost any of their first freshness, and are, as it were, faded or tarnished by time, so far are they obscure. Complex ideas, as they are made up of simple ones, so they are clear, when the ideas that go to their composition are clear, and the number and order of those simple ideas that are the ingredients of any complex one is determinate and certain.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">用与视觉有关的词语来解释心灵的感知是最恰当的，通过思考我们在视觉对象中所谓的清晰和不清晰，我们将最能理解我们的想法中的清晰和不清晰是什么意思。光线是向我们揭示可见物体的东西，我们给那些没有被置于足以向我们揭示其中可观察到的形状和颜色的光线中的物体起名为不透明，而这些物体在更好的光线下是可以被辨认出来的。同样地，当我们的简单概念与它们所来自的对象本身在一个良好的感觉或知觉中所呈现的那样时，它们就是清晰的。当记忆这样保留它们，并在有机会考虑它们的时候能够将它们呈现给头脑时，它们就是清晰的观念。只要它们要么缺乏最初的精确性，要么失去了最初的新鲜感，并因时间而褪色或被玷污，那么它们就会变得模糊不清。复杂的观念，因为它们是由简单的观念组成的，所以它们是清楚的，当组成它们的观念是清楚的，而且作为任何复杂观念的成分的那些简单观念的数量和顺序是确定的和肯定的。</p>

If the organs, or faculties of perception, like wax over-hardened with cold, will not receive the impression of the seal, from the usual impulse wont to imprint it; or, like wax of a temper too soft, will not hold it well, when well imprinted; or else supposing the wax of a temper fit, but the seal not applied with a sufficient force to make a clear impression: in any of these cases, the print left by the seal will be obscure.

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在简单的概念中，造成模糊的原因似乎要么是器官迟钝；要么是物体给人的印象非常轻微和短暂；要么是记忆力薄弱，无法保留所接受的印象。为了帮助我们理解这个问题，我们再次回到可见物体上。如果感知的器官或能力，像因寒冷而过度硬化的蜡一样，不会从通常的冲动中接受印章的印记；或者，像脾气太软的蜡一样，在印记良好的情况下，不会很好地保持它；或者，假设蜡的脾气合适，但印章没有用足够的力量留下清晰的印记：在任何这些情况下，印章留下的印记将是模糊的。我想，这种情况不需要用什么方法来使它更清晰。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">To remove this difficulty, and to help us to conceive aright what it is that makes the confusion ideas are at any time chargeable with, we must consider, that things ranked under distinct names are supposed different enough to be distinguished, that so each sort by its peculiar name may be marked, and discoursed of apart upon any occasion: and there is nothing more evident, than that the greatest part of different names are supposed to stand for different things. Now every idea a man has, being visibly what it is, and distinct from all other ideas but itself; that which makes it confused, is, when it is such that it may as well be called by another name as that which it is expressed by; the difference which keeps the things (to be ranked under those two different names) distinct, and makes some of them belong rather to the one and some of them to the other of those names, being left out; and so the distinction, which was intended to be kept up by those different names, is quite lost.</p>

</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为，通常造成这种混乱的违约行为主要有以下几种。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, complex ideas made up of too few simple ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第一，由太少的简单想法组成的复杂想法。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, when any complex idea (for it is complex ideas that are most liable to confusion) is made up of too small a number of simple ideas, and such only as are common to other things, whereby the differences that make it deserve a different name, are left out. Thus, he that has an idea made up of barely the simple ones of a beast with spots, has but a confused idea of a leopard; it not being thereby sufficiently distinguished from a lynx, and several other sorts of beasts that are spotted. So that such an idea, though it hath the peculiar name leopard, is not distinguishable from those designed by the names lynx or panther, and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard. How much the custom of defining of words by general terms contributes to make the ideas we would express by them confused and undetermined, I leave others to consider. This is evident, that confused ideas are such as render the use of words uncertain, and take away the benefit of distinct names. When the ideas, for which we use different terms, have not a difference answerable to their distinct names, and so cannot be distinguished by them, there it is that they are truly confused.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，当任何复杂的观念（因为最容易混淆的是复杂的观念）是由太少的简单观念组成的，而且只是与其他事物共同的观念，从而忽略了使它值得一个不同名称的差异。因此，如果一个人对有斑点的野兽只有简单的概念，那么他对豹子的概念就是混乱的；它没有充分地与猞猁和其他几种有斑点的野兽区分开。因此，这种想法，尽管它有一个特殊的名字豹子，但却无法与猞猁或豹子的名字区分开来，而且还可以归入猞猁的名字，而不是豹子。用一般术语来定义词语的习惯在多大程度上有助于使我们想用它们来表达的思想变得混乱和不确定，我让其他人来考虑。这一点很明显，混乱的观念会使词语的使用变得不确定，并使独特的名称失去好处。当我们用不同的术语来表达的观念，没有与它们的独特名称相适应的差异，因此无法用它们来区分时，它们就真的被混淆了。</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">8.第二，或者他们的简单的无序地拼凑在一起。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, Another fault which makes our ideas confused is, when, though the particulars that make up any idea are in number enough, yet they are so jumbled together, that it is not easily discernible whether it more belongs to the name that is given it than to any other. There is nothing properer to make us conceive this confusion than a sort of pictures, usually shown as surprising pieces of art, wherein the colours, as they are laid by the pencil on the table itself, mark out very odd and unusual figures, and have no discernible order in their position. This draught, thus made up of parts wherein no symmetry nor order appears, is in itself no more a confused thing, than the picture of a cloudy sky; wherein, though there be as little order of colours or figures to be found, yet nobody thinks it a confused picture. What is it, then, that makes it be thought confused, since the want of symmetry does not? As it is plain it does not: for another draught made barely in imitation of this could not be called confused. I answer, That which makes it be thought confused is, the applying it to some name to which it does no more discernibly belong than to some other: v.g. when it is said to be the picture of a man, or Caesar, then any one with reason counts it confused; because it is not discernible in that state to belong more to the name man, or Caesar, than to the name baboon, or Pompey: which are supposed to stand for different ideas from those signified by man, or Caesar. But when a cylindrical mirror, placed right, had reduced those irregular lines on the table into their due order and proportion, then the confusion ceases, and the eye presently sees that it is a man, or Caesar; i.e. that it belongs to those names; and that it is sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon, or Pompey; i.e. from the ideas signified by those names. Just thus it is with our ideas, which are as it were the pictures of things. No one of these mental draughts, however the parts are put together, can be called confused (for they are plainly discernible as they are) till it be ranked under some ordinary name to which it cannot be discerned to belong, any more than it does to some other name of an allowed different signification.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，另一个使我们的观念混乱的错误是，尽管构成任何观念的细节数量足够多，但它们是如此杂乱无章，以至于不容易辨别它是否更属于被赋予的名字而不是其他名字。没有什么比一种通常作为艺术作品展示的图片更能让我们想象到这种混乱了，其中的颜色，当它们被铅笔放在桌子上的时候，标出了非常奇怪和不寻常的数字，并且在它们的位置上没有可识别的秩序。这种由不对称或无秩序的部分组成的图画，本身并不像阴天的图画那样混乱；在那里，虽然没有什么颜色或数字的秩序可言，但没有人认为它是混乱的图画。那么，是什么原因使它被认为是混乱的，而缺乏对称性却不会？很明显，它不是这样的：因为另一幅勉强模仿这幅画的草图也不能被称为混乱。我回答说，使它被认为是混乱的是，把它应用于一些名字，而它并没有比其他名字更明显的归属感：例如，当它被说成是一个人或凯撒的画，那么任何有理由的人都认为它是混乱的；因为在那种情况下，它不可能比狒狒或庞贝更属于人或凯撒这个名字：它们应该代表与人或凯撒所代表的不同概念。但是，当一面圆柱形的镜子，摆正了位置，把桌子上那些不规则的线条还原成它们应有的秩序和比例时，这种混乱就停止了，眼睛马上就能看到它是一个人，或者凯撒；也就是说，它属于这些名字；而且它与狒狒或庞培有足够的区别；也就是说，与这些名字所象征的观念有区别。我们的观念也是如此，它们就像事物的图片一样。这些精神图画中的任何一个，无论其部分如何组合，都不能被称为混乱（因为它们是可以清楚地辨别出来的），除非它被归入一些普通的名字，而这些名字不能被辨别出来，就像它归入其他一些具有不同含义的名字一样。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Thirdly, A third defect that frequently gives the name of confused to our ideas, is, when any one of them is uncertain and undetermined. Thus we may observe men who, not forbearing to use the ordinary words of their language till they have learned their precise signification, change the idea they make this or that term stand for, almost as often as they use it. He that does this out of uncertainty of what he should leave out, or put into his idea of CHURCH, or IDOLATRY, every time he thinks of either, and holds not steady to any one precise combination of ideas that makes it up, is said to have a confused idea of idolatry or the church: though this be still for the same reason as the former, viz. because a mutable idea (if we will allow it to be one idea) cannot belong to one name rather than another, and so loses the distinction that distinct names are designed for.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，第三种缺陷是，当我们的观念中的任何一个不确定和不确定的时候，就经常被称为混乱。因此，我们可以看到，有些人在了解其语言中的普通词汇的确切含义之前，不敢使用这些词汇，他们几乎在使用这些词汇的同时，就改变了他们让这个或那个词汇代表的概念。他这样做是由于不确定他应该撇开什么，或者把什么放进他的教会或偶像崇拜的概念中，每次他想到这两者时，都不稳定于任何一个构成概念的精确组合，被说成是对偶像崇拜或教会有混乱的概念：尽管这仍然是出于与前者相同的原因，即因为一个可变的概念（如果我们允许它是一个概念）不能属于一个名称而不是另一个，因此失去了不同名称所要的区别。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">By what has been said, we may observe how much NAMES, as supposed steady signs of things, and by their difference to stand for, and keep things distinct that in themselves are different, are the occasion of denominating ideas distinct or confused, by a secret and unobserved reference the mind makes of its ideas to such names. This perhaps will be fuller understood, after what I say of Words in the third Book has been read and considered. But without taking notice of such a reference of ideas to distinct names, as the signs of distinct things, it will be hard to say what a confused idea is. And therefore when a man designs, by any name, a sort of things, or any one particular thing, distinct from all others, the complex idea he annexes to that name is the more distinct, the more particular the ideas are, and the greater and more determinate the number and order of them is, whereof it is made up. For, the more it has of these, the more it has still of the perceivable differences, whereby it is kept separate and distinct from all ideas belonging to other names, even those that approach nearest to it, and thereby all confusion with them is avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">通过上述内容，我们可以观察到，名称作为事物的稳定标志，并通过其差异性来代表和保持本身不同的事物，是如何通过心灵对这些名称的秘密和不被注意的参考，来命名不同或混乱的观念的场合。在阅读和考虑了我在第三本书中关于词语的内容之后，也许就能更充分地理解这一点。但是，如果不注意到思想对不同名称的这种参照，作为不同事物的标志，就很难说什么是混乱的思想。因此，当一个人用任何名字来设计一种事物，或任何一种特殊的事物，与所有其他的事物不同，他附在这个名字上的复杂观念就越明显，观念就越特殊，它们的数量和顺序就越大，越确定，它是由这些观念组成的。因为，它拥有的这些东西越多，它拥有的可感知的差异也就越多，据此，它与属于其他名称的所有观念，甚至那些最接近它的观念，保持着分离和不同，从而避免了与它们的一切混淆。</p>

<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">This, I think, is the confusion proper to ideas; which still carries with it a secret reference to names. At least, if there be any other confusion of ideas, this is that which most of all disorders men’s thoughts and discourses: ideas, as ranked under names, being those that for the most part men reason of within themselves, and always those which they commune about with others. And therefore where there are supposed two different ideas, marked by two different names, which are not as distinguishable as the sounds that stand for them, there never fails to be confusion; and where any ideas are distinct as the ideas of those two sounds they are marked by, there can be between them no confusion. The way to prevent it is to collect and unite into one complex idea, as precisely as is possible, all those ingredients whereby it is differenced from others; and to them, so united in a determinate number and order, apply steadily the same name. But this neither accommodating men’s ease or vanity, nor serving any design but that of naked truth, which is not always the thing aimed at, such exactness is rather to be wished than hoped for. And since the loose application of names, to undetermined, variable, and almost no ideas, serves both to cover our own ignorance, as well as to perplex and confound others, which goes for learning and superiority in knowledge, it is no wonder that most men should use it themselves, whilst they complain of it in others. Though I think no small part of the confusion to be found in the notions of men might, by care and ingenuity, be avoided, yet I am far from concluding it everywhere wilful. Some ideas are so complex, and made up of so many parts, that the memory does not easily retain the very same precise combination of simple ideas under one name: much less are we able constantly to divine for what precise complex idea such a name stands in another man’s use of it. From the first of these, follows confusion in a man’s own reasonings and opinions within himself; from the latter, frequent confusion in discoursing and arguing with others. But having more at large treated of Words, their defects, and abuses, in the following Book, I shall here say no more of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我认为，这就是观念上的混乱；它仍然暗含着对名称的参考。至少，如果有任何其他观念的混乱，这就是最能扰乱人们的思想和言论的混乱：观念，作为名字下的等级，在大多数情况下是人们在自己内部推理的，而且总是他们与他人交流的那些。因此，如果有两个不同的想法，用两个不同的名字来标记，而这两个名字又不像代表它们的声音那样可以区分，那么就不会出现混乱；而如果任何想法都像它们所标记的那两个声音的想法那样明显，那么它们之间就不会出现混乱。防止混淆的方法是尽可能精确地收集和结合成一个复杂的概念，即它与其他概念不同的所有成分；并将它们以确定的数量和顺序结合起来，稳定地使用同一个名称。但是，这既不能满足人们的轻松或虚荣，也不能为任何设计服务，只能是赤裸裸的真理，而这并不总是目的，这样的精确性是希望的，而不是希望的。既然对未确定的、多变的、几乎没有的概念松散地使用名称，既是为了掩盖我们自己的无知，也是为了使别人感到困惑和迷惑，这对学习和知识的优越性是有好处的，难怪大多数人在抱怨别人的同时，自己也在使用这种做法。虽然我认为在人们的观念中发现的混乱，有一小部分是可以通过谨慎和智慧来避免的，但我远远不能断定它是故意的。有些观念是如此复杂，由许多部分组成，以至于记忆不容易在一个名字下保留相同的简单观念的精确组合：我们更不可能不断地推断出这样一个名字在另一个人的使用中代表着什么精确的复杂观念。由此，一个人在自己内部的推理和观点就会出现混乱；由后者，在与他人讨论和争论时也会经常出现混乱。但是，在下一本书中，我已经对词语、它们的缺陷和滥用作了更多的论述，在此不再赘述。</p>

He will, I doubt not, be able to distinguish these two ideas one from another, by the number of sides; and reason and argue distinctly about them, whilst he keeps his thoughts and reasoning to that part only of these ideas which is contained in their numbers; as that the sides of the one could be divided into two equal numbers, and of the others not, &amp;c. But when he goes about to distinguish them by their figure, he will there be presently at a loss, and not be able, I think, to frame in his mind two ideas, one of them distinct from the other, by the bare figure of these two pieces of gold; as he could, if the same parcels of gold were made one into a cube, the other a figure of five sides. In which incomplete ideas, we are very apt to impose on ourselves, and wrangle with others, especially where they have particular and familiar names. For, being satisfied in that part of the idea which we have clear; and the name which is familiar to us, being applied to the whole, containing that part also which is imperfect and obscure, we are apt to use it for that confused part, and draw deductions from it in the obscure part of its signification, as confidently as we do from the other.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">In matter, we have no clear ideas of the smallness of parts much beyond the smallest that occur to any of our senses: and therefore, when we talk of the divisibility of matter IN INFINITUM, though we have clear ideas of division and divisibility, and have also clear ideas of parts made out of a whole by division; yet we have but very obscure and confused ideas of corpuscles, or minute bodies, so to be divided, when, by former divisions, they are reduced to a smallness much exceeding the perception of any of our senses; and so all that we have clear and distinct ideas of is of what division in general or abstractedly is, and the relation of TOTUM and PARS: but of the bulk of the body, to be thus infinitely divided after certain progressions, I think, we have no clear nor distinct idea at all. For I ask any one, whether, taking the smallest atom of dust he ever saw, he has any distinct idea (bating still the number, which concerns not extension) betwixt the 100,000th and the 1,000,000th part of it. Or if he think he can refine his ideas to that degree, without losing sight of them, let him add ten cyphers to each of those numbers. Such a degree of smallness is not unreasonable to be supposed; since a division carried on so far brings it no nearer the end of infinite division, than the first division into two halves does. I must confess, for my part, I have no clear distinct ideas of the different bulk or extension of those bodies, having but a very obscure one of either of them. So that, I think, when we talk of division of bodies in infinitum, our idea of their distinct bulks, which is the subject and foundation of division, comes, after a little progression, to be confounded, and almost lost in obscurity. For that idea which is to represent only bigness must be very obscure and confused, which we cannot distinguish from one ten times as big, but only by number: so that we have clear distinct ideas, we may say, of ten and one, but no distinct ideas of two such extensions. It is plain from hence, that, when we talk of infinite divisibility of body or extension, our distinct and clear ideas are only of numbers: but the clear distinct ideas of extension, after some progress of division, are quite lost; and of such minute parts we have no distinct ideas at all; but it returns, as all our ideas of infinite do, at last to that of NUMBER ALWAYS TO BE ADDED; but thereby never amounts to any distinct idea of ACTUAL INFINITE PARTS. We have, it is true, a clear idea of division, as often as we think of it; but thereby we have no more a clear idea of infinite parts in matter, than we have a clear idea of an infinite number, by being able still to add new numbers to any assigned numbers we have: endless divisibility giving us no more a clear and distinct idea of actually infinite parts, than endless addibility (if I may so speak) gives us a clear and distinct idea of an actually infinite number: they both being only in a power still of increasing the number, be it already as great as it will. So that of what remains to be added (WHEREIN CONSISTS THE INFINITY) we have but an obscure, imperfect, and confused idea; from or about which we can argue or reason with no certainty or clearness, no more than we can in arithmetic, about a number of which we have no such distinct idea as we have of 4 or 100; but only this relative obscure one, that, compared to any other, it is still bigger: and we have no more a clear positive idea of it, when we [dropped line*] than if we should say it is bigger than 40 or 4: 400,000,000 having no nearer a proportion to the end of addition or number than 4. For he that adds only 4 to 4, and so proceeds, shall as soon come to the end of all addition, as he that adds 400,000,000 to 400,000,000. And so likewise in eternity; he that has an idea of but four years, has as much a positive complete idea of eternity, as he that has one of 400,000,000 of years: for what remains of eternity beyond either of these two numbers of years, is as clear to the one as the other; i.e. neither of them has any clear positive idea of it at all. For he that adds only 4 years to 4, and so on, shall as soon reach eternity as he that adds 400,000,000 of years, and so on; or, if he please, doubles the increase as often as he will: the remaining abyss being still as far beyond the end of all these progressions as it is from the length of a day or an hour. For nothing finite bears any proportion to infinite; and therefore our ideas, which are all finite, cannot bear any. Thus it is also in our idea of extension, when we increase it by addition, as well as when we diminish it by division, and would enlarge our thoughts to infinite space. After a few doublings of those ideas of extension, which are the largest we are accustomed to have, we lose the clear distinct idea of that space: it becomes a confusedly great one, with a surplus of still greater; about which, when we would argue or reason, we shall always find ourselves at a loss; confused ideas, in our arguings and deductions from that part of them which is confused, always leading us into confusion.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">在物质中，我们对超出我们任何感官所能感觉到的最小的部分的微小性没有明确的概念。因此，当我们谈论物质的无限可分性时，虽然我们对分割和可分性有清晰的概念，对通过分割从整体中产生的部分也有清晰的概念。但是，我们对细胞或微小的物体的概念却非常模糊和混乱，当这些物体通过以前的分割被缩小到远远超过我们任何感官的感知时，它们就会被分割；因此，我们对一般的或抽象的分割是什么，以及TOTUM和PARS的关系，只有清晰和明确的想法。但是，对于身体的体积，在经过一定的发展之后被无限地分割，我认为，我们根本就没有明确或清晰的概念。因为我问任何人，以他所见过的最小的尘埃原子为例，他是否对它的第10万分之一和第100万分之一有任何明显的概念（仍然是数字，这不涉及延伸）。或者，如果他认为他可以把他的想法细化到这个程度，而不失去对它们的认识，那么就让他在这些数字的每一部分上增加十个字母。这种小的程度不是没有道理可言的；因为如此划分，并不比第一次划分成两半更接近无限划分的终点。我必须承认，就我而言，我对这些物体的不同体积或延伸没有清晰明确的想法，对其中任何一个都有非常模糊的认识。因此，我认为，当我们无限地谈论物体的分割时，我们对它们的不同体积的想法，也就是分割的主题和基础，在稍作进展后，就会被混淆，并几乎在模糊中消失。因为那个只代表大的概念必须是非常模糊和混乱的，我们不能把它与一个十倍大的概念区分开来，而只能通过数字来区分：因此，我们可以说，我们对十和一有明确的不同概念，但对两个这样的扩展没有不同的概念。由此可见，当我们谈论身体或延伸的无限可分性时，我们的明确和清晰的观念只是数字：但延伸的明确清晰的观念，在经过一些划分之后，就完全丧失了；对于这样的细小部分，我们根本没有明确的观念；但它又像我们所有关于无限的观念一样，最后回到了永远要增加的数字的观念；但因此永远不等于实际的无限部分的任何明确观念。我们确实有一个明确的除法概念，因为我们经常想到它；但因此我们对物质中的无限部分的明确概念，并不比我们对无限数的明确概念更多，因为我们仍然能够在任何指定的数字上增加新的数字：无尽的可除性给我们一个关于实际无限部分的明确和清晰的概念，并不比无尽的可加性（如果我可以这样说）给我们一个实际无限的数字的明确和清晰的概念更多：它们都只是在增加数字的力量，无论它已经有多大。因此，对于尚待增加的数字（其中包含无限），我们只有一个模糊的、不完善的和混乱的概念；从这个概念中，我们可以不确定地或清晰地进行争论或推理，就像我们在算术中一样，对于一个数字，我们没有像4或100那样的明确概念；而只有这个相对模糊的概念，即与任何其他数字相比，它仍然更大。当我们说它比40或4大时，我们对它没有更明确的肯定的概念：400,000,000不比4更接近于加法或数的终点的比例。因为只把4加到4的人，这样进行下去，就会像把400,000,000加到400,000,000的人一样，很快达到所有加法的尽头。同样，在永恒中也是如此；拥有4年概念的人，与拥有400,000,000年概念的人一样，对永恒有着积极完整的概念：因为在这两个年数中的任何一个之外的永恒，对一个人和另一个人都是清楚的；也就是说，他们都没有任何明确的积极概念。因为只在4年的基础上增加4年，以此类推，就会像在400,000,000年的基础上增加400,000,000年一样，很快达到永恒；或者，如果他愿意，可以经常增加一倍：剩下的深渊仍然远远超出所有这些进展的终点，就像它离一天或一小时的长度一样。因为没有任何有限的东西能与无限的东西成比例；因此我们的观念，都是有限的，不能有任何比例。因此，在我们的延伸概念中也是如此，当我们通过加法来增加它，以及通过除法来减少它，并将我们的思想扩大到无限的空间。在那些我们习惯于拥有的最大的延伸概念翻了几番之后，我们就失去了那个空间的清晰明确的概念：它变成了一个混乱的大概念，还有一个更大的剩余；关于这个概念，当我们要争论或推理时，我们总是发现自己无所适从；混乱的概念，在我们的争论和从其中混乱的部分进行推理时，总是把我们引入混乱。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, Our SIMPLE IDEAS are all real, all agree to the reality of things: not that they are all of them the images or representations of what does exist; the contrary whereof, in all but the primary qualities of bodies, hath been already shown. But, though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than pain is; yet those ideas of whiteness and coldness, pain, &amp;c., being in us the effects of powers in things without us, ordained by our Maker to produce in us such sensations; they are real ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the qualities that are really in things themselves. For, these several appearances being designed to be the mark whereby we are to know and distinguish things which we have to do with, our ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and are as real distinguishing characters, whether they be only CONSTANT EFFECTS, or else EXACT RESEMBLANCES of something in the things themselves: the reality lying in that steady correspondence they have with the distinct constitutions of real beings. But whether they answer to those constitutions, as to causes or patterns, it matters not; it suffices that they are constantly produced by them. And thus our simple ideas are all real and true, because they answer and agree to those powers of things which produce them on our minds; that being all that is requisite to make them real, and not fictions at pleasure. For in simple ideas (as has been shown) the mind is wholly confined to the operation of things upon it, and can make to itself no simple idea, more than what it was received.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我们的简单观念都是真实的，都与事物的真实性相一致：而不是说它们都是实际存在的事物的形象或代表；除了身体的主要品质外，在所有其他方面都与此相反，这一点已经表明。但是，尽管白和冷在雪中并不比疼痛更多；但那些关于白和冷、疼痛等的观念，在我们身上是我们以外的事物的力量所产生的效果，是我们的造物主指定要在我们身上产生这种感觉的；它们在我们身上是真实的观念，我们据此区分真正存在于事物本身的品质。因为，这几种表象被设计为我们认识和区分我们必须处理的事物的标志，我们的观念也为我们达到这一目的而服务，并且是真正的区分特征，无论它们只是持续的效果，还是事物本身的确切反应：其真实性在于它们与真实存在的独特结构的稳定对应。但是，它们是否与这些构成相呼应，作为原因或模式，这并不重要；只要它们是由这些构成不断产生的就够了。因此，我们的简单观念都是真实的，因为它们与那些在我们头脑中产生它们的事物的力量相吻合；这就是使它们成为真实而不是随意虚构的所有必要条件。因为在简单的观念中（正如已经表明的那样），思想完全局限于事物对它的作用，并且不能使自己的简单观念超过它所接受的东西。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Though the mind be wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas; yet, I think, we may say it is not so in respect of its complex ideas. For those being combinations of simple ideas put together, and united under one general name, it is plain that the mind of man uses some kind of liberty in forming those complex ideas: how else comes it to pass that one man’s idea of gold, or justice, is different from another’s, but because he has put in, or left out of his, some simple idea which the other has not?

		<p class="calibre5 cn">尽管心灵在其简单的观念方面是完全被动的，但我认为，我们可以说它在其复杂的观念方面并非如此。因为那些简单的观念组合在一起，并被统一在一个总的名称之下，很明显，人的头脑在形成这些复杂的观念时使用了某种自由：否则，一个人的黄金观念或正义观念怎么会与另一个人的不同，而是因为他把另一个人没有的一些简单观念放进或放掉了？那么问题来了，哪些是真实的，哪些是勉强想象出来的组合？哪些集合符合事物的现实，哪些不符合？对此，我要说的是。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, having no other reality but what they have in the minds of men, there is nothing more required to this kind of ideas to make them real, but that they be so framed, that there be a possibility of existing conformable to them. These ideas themselves, being archetypes, cannot differ from their archetypes, and so cannot be chimerical, unless any one will jumble together in them inconsistent ideas. Indeed, as any of them have the names of a known language assigned to them, by which he that has them in his mind would signify them to others, so bare possibility of existing is not enough; they must have a conformity to the ordinary signification of the name that is given them, that they may not be thought fantastical: as if a man would give the name of justice to that idea which common use calls liberality. But this fantasticalness relates more to propriety of speech, than reality of ideas. For a man to be undisturbed in danger, sedately to consider what is fittest to be done, and to execute it steadily, is a mixed mode, or a complex idea of an action which may exist. But to be undisturbed in danger, without using one’s reason or industry, is what is also possible to be; and so is as real an idea as the other. Though the first of these, having the name COURAGE given to it, may, in respect of that name, be a right or wrong idea; but the other, whilst it has not a common received name of any known language assigned to it, is not capable of any deformity, being made with no reference to anything but itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，混合模式和关系，除了它们在人的头脑中所拥有的，没有其他的现实，对这种观念没有更多的要求，以使它们成为现实，但它们是如此的框架，有可能存在与它们相一致。这些观念本身，作为原型，不可能与它们的原型不同，因此不可能是嵌合的，除非有人将不一致的观念混杂在一起。事实上，正如它们中的任何一个都有一个已知语言的名称，在他心中有这些名称的人就会向别人表示它们，所以光有存在的可能性是不够的；它们必须符合赋予它们的名称的普通含义，这样它们才不会被认为是幻想的：就好像一个人要把正义的名称赋予那个通常被称为自由的想法。但这种幻想性更多地是与言语的恰当性有关，而不是与观念的真实性有关。对于一个人来说，在危险中不受干扰，冷静地考虑什么是最合适的，并稳定地执行它，是一种混合模式，或者说是一种可能存在的复杂的行动理念。但是，在危险中不受干扰，不使用自己的理智或工业，也是可能存在的；所以是和另一个一样真实的想法。虽然其中的第一种，由于被赋予了 "勇气 "这一名称，就这一名称而言，可能是一种正确的或错误的想法；但另一种，虽然没有任何已知语言中的通用名称赋予它，但它不可能有任何畸形，因为它是在没有提及任何东西的情况下产生的，只是它自己。</p>

On the contrary, those are fantastical which are made up of such collections of simple ideas as were really never united, never were found together in any substance: v. g. a rational creature, consisting of a horse’s head, joined to a body of human shape, or such as the CENTAURS are described: or, a body yellow, very malleable, fusible, and fixed, but lighter than common water: or an uniform, unorganized body, consisting, as to sense, all of similar parts, with perception and voluntary motion joined to it. Whether such substances as these can possibly exist or no, it is probable we do not know: but be that as it will, these ideas of substances, being made conformable to no pattern existing that we know; and consisting of such collections of ideas as no substance ever showed us united together, they ought to pass with us for barely imaginary: but much more are those complex ideas so, which contain in them any inconsistency or contradiction of their parts.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，我们对物质的复杂观念，都是参照没有我们存在的事物而产生的，旨在表现物质的真实面貌，除了它们是真正结合在一起的简单观念的组合，并在没有我们存在的事物中共存之外，再没有其他的真实。相反，那些由从未真正结合在一起的简单观念的集合构成的幻想，从未在任何物质中发现过：例如，一个理性的生物，由一个马头组成，与一个人形的身体相连，或者像CENTAURS所描述的那样：或者，一个黄色的身体，非常有延展性，可熔化，固定，但比普通水轻：或者一个统一的，没有组织的身体，就感觉而言，由所有类似部分组成，有感知和自愿运动与它相连。这些物质是否可能存在，我们很可能不知道：但无论如何，这些关于物质的想法，由于符合我们所知道的任何现有模式；并且由没有任何物质向我们展示过的想法集合在一起组成，它们应该被我们认为是勉强的想象：但那些复杂的想法更是如此，它们包含了它们的任何不一致或矛盾的部分。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, that ALL OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ADEQUATE. Because, being nothing but the effects of certain powers in things, fitted and ordained by God to produce such sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent and adequate to those powers: and we are sure they agree to the reality of things. For, if sugar produce in us the ideas which we call whiteness and sweetness, we are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those ideas in our minds, or else they could not have been produced by it. And so each sensation answering the power that operates on any of our senses, the idea so produced is a real idea, (and not a fiction of the mind, which has no power to produce any simple idea); and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple ideas are adequate. It is true, the things producing in us these simple ideas are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the CAUSES of them; but as if those ideas were real beings IN them. For, though fire be called painful to the touch, whereby is signified the power of producing in us the idea of pain, yet it is denominated also light and hot; as if light and heat were really something in the fire, more than a power to excite these ideas in us; and therefore are called qualities in or of the fire. But these being nothing, in truth, but powers to excite such ideas in us, I must in that sense be understood, when I speak of secondary qualities as being in things; or of their ideas as being the objects that excite them in us. Such ways of speaking, though accommodated to the vulgar notions, without which one cannot be well understood, yet truly signify nothing but those powers which are in things to excite certain sensations or ideas in us. Since were there no fit organs to receive the impressions fire makes on the sight and touch, nor a mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas of light and heat by those impressions from the fire or sun, there would yet be no more light or heat in the world than there would be pain if there were no sensible creature to feel it, though the sun should continue just as it is now, and Mount AEtna flame higher than ever it did. Solidity and extension, and the termination of it, figure, with motion and rest, whereof we have the ideas, would be really in the world as they are, whether there were any sensible being to perceive them or no: and therefore we have reason to look on those as the real modifications of matter, and such as are the exciting causes of all our various sensations from bodies. But this being an inquiry not belonging to this place, I shall enter no further into it, but proceed to show what complex ideas are adequate, and what not.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，我们所有简单的想法都是适当的。因为，它们只不过是事物中某些力量的效果，由上帝安排在我们身上产生这样的感觉，它们不能不与这些力量相对应和充分：而且我们确信它们与事物的现实相一致。因为，如果糖在我们身上产生了我们称之为白色和甜味的观念，我们肯定糖中有一种力量在我们的头脑中产生这些观念，否则它们就不可能由它产生。因此，每一种感觉都是对我们任何一种感官所运作的力量的回应，这样产生的观念是一种真正的观念，（而不是心灵的虚构，因为心灵没有能力产生任何简单的观念）；而且不能不说是充分的，因为它只应该回应这种力量：所以所有简单的观念都是充分的。诚然，在我们身上产生这些简单观念的东西，只有少数被我们称为，仿佛它们只是它们的原因；但仿佛这些观念是它们中的真实存在。因为，尽管火被称为 "触痛"，这意味着在我们体内产生痛苦观念的力量，但它也被称为 "光 "和 "热"；仿佛光和热真的是火中的东西，而不仅仅是在我们体内激发这些观念的力量；因此被称为火中或火的品质。但事实上，这些东西只不过是在我们身上激发这种观念的力量，当我把次要的品质说成是事物中的品质；或把它们的观念说成是在我们身上激发它们的对象时，我必须从这个意义上理解。这样的说话方式，虽然适应了庸俗的观念，没有这种观念就不能很好地理解，但真正的意思是，除了那些在事物中激发我们的某些感觉或观念的力量之外，没有别的。如果没有合适的器官来接受火在视觉和触觉上的印象，也没有与这些器官相连的思想来接受来自火或太阳的光和热的概念，那么世界上就不会有更多的光或热，就像没有有感觉的生物来感受疼痛一样，尽管太阳应该像现在这样继续存在，艾特纳山的火焰比以前更高。固体和延伸，以及它的终止，加上运动和静止，我们有这样的想法，无论是否有任何可感知的生物来感知它们，它们都会真实地存在于这个世界上：因此，我们有理由把这些看作是物质的真正变化，而且是我们从身体上获得的所有各种感觉的刺激性原因。但是，由于这不属于这个地方的调查，我将不再进一步讨论，而是继续说明哪些复杂的观念是充分的，哪些不是。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">3.模式都很充分。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF MODES, being voluntary collections of simple ideas, which the mind puts together, without reference to any real archetypes, or standing patterns, existing anywhere, are and cannot but be ADEQUATE IDEAS. Because they, not being intended for copies of things really existing, but for archetypes made by the mind, to rank and denominate things by, cannot want anything; they having each of them that combination of ideas, and thereby that perfection, which the mind intended they should: so that the mind acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus, by having the idea of a figure with three sides meeting at three angles, I have a complete idea, wherein I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the mind is satisfied with the perfection of this its idea is plain, in that it does not conceive that any understanding hath, or can have, a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signifies by the word triangle, supposing it to exist, than itself has, in that complex idea of three sides and three angles, in which is contained all that is or can be essential to it, or necessary to complete it, wherever or however it exists. But in our IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES it is otherwise. For there, desiring to copy things as they really do exist, and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties depend, we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend: we find they still want something we should be glad were in them; and so are all inadequate. But MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, being archetypes without patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves, cannot but be adequate, everything being so to itself. He that at first put together the idea of danger perceived, absence of disorder from fear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be done, and executing that without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger of it, had certainly in his mind that complex idea made up of that combination: and intending it to be nothing else but what is, nor to have in it any other simple ideas but what it hath, it could not also but be an adequate idea: and laying this up in his memory, with the name COURAGE annexed to it, to signify to others, and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a standard to measure and denominate actions by, as they agreed to it. This idea, thus made and laid up for a pattern, must necessarily be adequate, being referred to nothing else but itself, nor made by any other original but the good liking and will of him that first made this combination.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，我们关于模式的复杂概念，是简单概念的自愿集合，由头脑拼凑而成，没有参照任何真正的原型，或存在于任何地方的常设模式，是而且不能是适当的概念。因为它们不是为了复制真实存在的事物，而是为了由头脑制作的原型，用来对事物进行排序和命名，所以不能有任何欠缺；它们每一个都有思想的组合，从而有头脑所希望的那种完美：所以头脑默认它们，而且找不到任何欠缺。因此，如果我有一个三边相接的图形的想法，我就有一个完整的想法，我不需要其他东西来使它完美。心灵对这个想法的完美性感到满意是很明显的，因为它不认为任何理解力对它用三角形这个词表示的东西有或能有比它自己在三条边和三个角的复杂想法中更完整或更完美的想法，在这个想法中包含了所有对它至关重要或能完成它的必要条件，无论它在哪里或如何存在。但在我们的物质概念中，情况却并非如此。因为在那里，我们希望照搬事物的真实存在，并向自己表述它们的所有属性所依赖的结构，但我们发现我们的想法并没有达到我们所期望的完美程度：我们发现它们仍然缺少一些我们应该高兴的东西；因此它们都是不充分的。但是，混合模式和关系，作为没有模式的原型，因此除了它们自己之外没有任何东西可以代表，所以不能不说是充分的，所有的东西对自己来说都是如此。他一开始就把察觉到的危险、没有恐惧造成的混乱、冷静地考虑要做的事、不受干扰地执行、或被危险吓倒的想法放在一起，他的脑海中肯定有由这种组合构成的复杂想法。并打算除了是什么，也没有其他简单的想法，除了它所拥有的，它也不能不说是一个充分的想法：并把这个想法放在他的记忆中，并把它的名字附在上面，向其他人表示，并从那里命名他应该观察到的与它一致的任何行动，从而有一个标准来衡量和命名的行动，因为他们同意它。这种想法，作为一种模式，必然是充分的，除了它本身，没有任何其他的参考，也不是由任何其他的原件，而是由最初创造这种组合的人的好感和意愿。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Indeed another coming after, and in conversation learning from him the word COURAGE, may make an idea, to which he gives the name courage, different from what the first author applied it to, and has in his mind when he uses it. And in this case, if he designs that his idea in thinking should be conformable to the other’s idea, as the name he uses in speaking is conformable in sound to his from whom he learned it, his idea may be very wrong and inadequate: because in this case, making the other man’s idea the pattern of his idea in thinking, as the other man’s word or sound is the pattern of his in speaking, his idea is so far defective and inadequate, as it is distant from the archetype and pattern he refers it to, and intends to express and signify by the name he uses for it; which name he would have to be a sign of the other man’s idea, (to which, in its proper use, it is primarily annexed,) and of his own, as agreeing to it: to which if his own does not exactly correspond, it is faulty and inadequate.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">事实上，另一个人在他之后，并在谈话中从他那里学到了 "勇气 "这个词，可能会产生一种想法，他给这个词起了个名字叫 "勇气"，这与第一个作者使用这个词时在他心中的想法不同。在这种情况下，如果他想让自己的思想与对方的思想相一致，就像他在说话时使用的名字在声音上与他所学的人相一致一样，那么他的思想可能是非常错误和不充分的。因为在这种情况下，把对方的思想作为他思想的模式，就像对方的词或声音是他说话的模式一样，他的思想到目前为止是有缺陷和不充分的，因为它与他所指的原型和模式相距甚远，并打算通过他为它使用的名字来表达和表示；他必须把这个名字作为对方思想的标志，（在其适当的使用中，它主要是附属于对方的）和他自己的标志，因为它与它相一致。如果他自己的名字不完全对应，那么它就是错误的和不充分的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Therefore these complex ideas of MODES, which they are referred by the mind, and intended to correspond to the ideas in the mind of some other intelligent being, expressed by the names we apply to them, they may be very deficient, wrong, and inadequate; because they agree not to that which the mind designs to be their archetype and pattern: in which respect only any idea of modes can be wrong, imperfect, or inadequate. And on this account our ideas of mixed modes are the most liable to be faulty of any other; but this refers more to proper speaking than knowing right.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">因此，这些复杂的模式观念，它们是由心灵所指的，并打算对应于其他一些智能生物心中的观念，由我们应用于它们的名称来表达，它们可能是非常不足、错误和不充分的；因为它们与心灵所设计的原型和模式不一致：在这方面，只有任何模式的观念可能是错误、不完善或不充分的。因此，我们对混合模式的想法是最容易出错的；但这更多的是指正确的说话，而不是知道正确。</p>

Sometimes they are only designed to be pictures and representations in the mind of things that do exist, by ideas of those qualities that are discoverable in them.

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">First, it is usual for men to make the names of substances stand for things as supposed to have certain real essences, whereby they are of this or that species: and names standing for nothing but the ideas that are in men’s minds, they must constantly refer their ideas to such real essences, as to their archetypes. That men (especially such as have been bred up in the learning taught in this part of the world) do suppose certain specific essences of substances, which each individual in its several kinds is made conformable to and partakes of, is so far from needing proof that it will be thought strange if any one should do otherwise. And thus they ordinarily apply the specific names they rank particular substances under, to things as distinguished by such specific real essences. Who is there almost, who would not take it amiss if it should be doubted whether he called himself a man, with any other meaning than as having the real essence of a man? And yet if you demand what those real essences are, it is plain men are ignorant, and know them not. From whence it follows, that the ideas they have in their minds, being referred to real essences, as to archetypes which are unknown, must be so far from being adequate that they cannot be supposed to be any representation of them at all. The complex ideas we have of substances are, as it has been shown, certain collections of simple ideas that have been observed or supposed constantly to exist together. But such a complex idea cannot be the real essence of any substance; for then the properties we discover in that body would depend on that complex idea, and be deducible from it, and their necessary connexion with it be known; as all properties of a triangle depend on, and, as far as they are discoverable, are deducible from the complex idea of three lines including a space. But it is plain that in our complex ideas of substances are not contained such ideas, on which all the other qualities that are to be found in them do depend. The common idea men have of iron is, a body of a certain colour, weight, and hardness; and a property that they look on as belonging to it, is malleableness. But yet this property has no necessary connexion with that complex idea, or any part of it: and there is no more reason to think that malleableness depends on that colour, weight, and hardness, than that colour or that weight depends on its malleableness. And yet, though we know nothing of these real essences, there is nothing more ordinary than that men should attribute the sorts of things to such essences. The particular parcel of matter which makes the ring I have on my finger is forwardly by most men supposed to have a real essence, whereby it is gold; and from whence those qualities flow which I find in it, viz. its peculiar colour, weight, hardness, fusibility, fixedness, and change of colour upon a slight touch of mercury, &amp;c. This essence, from which all these properties flow, when I inquire into it and search after it, I plainly perceive I cannot discover: the furthest I can go is, only to presume that, it being nothing but body, its real essence or internal constitution, on which these qualities depend, can be nothing but the figure, size, and connexion of its solid parts; of neither of which having any distinct perception at all can I have any idea of its essence: which is the cause that it has that particular shining yellowness; a greater weight than anything I know of the same bulk; and a fitness to have its colour changed by the touch of quicksilver. If any one will say, that the real essence and internal constitution, on which these properties depend, is not the figure, size, and arrangement or connexion of its solid parts, but something else, called its particular FORM, I am further from having any idea of its real essence than I was before. For I have an idea of figure, size, and situation of solid parts in general, though I have none of the particular figure, size, or putting together of parts, whereby the qualities above mentioned are produced; which qualities I find in that particular parcel of matter that is on my finger, and not in another parcel of matter, with which I cut the pen I write with. But, when I am told that something besides the figure, size, and posture of the solid parts of that body in its essence, something called SUBSTANTIAL FORM, of that I confess I have no idea at all, but only of the sound form; which is far enough from an idea of its real essence or constitution. The like ignorance as I have of the real essence of this particular substance, I have also of the real essence of all other natural ones: of which essences I confess I have no distinct ideas at all; and, I am apt to suppose, others, when they examine their own knowledge, will find in themselves, in this one point, the same sort of ignorance.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，人们通常使物质的名称代表事物，认为它们具有某些真正的本质，因此它们属于这个或那个种类：而名称只代表人们头脑中的观念，他们必须不断地把他们的观念指向这种真正的本质，作为他们的原型。人们（尤其是在这一地区所教的学问中培养出来的人）确实假定物质的某些特定本质，每个人在其若干种类中都符合并属于这些本质，这一点不需要证明，如果有人不这样做，就会被认为是奇怪的。因此，他们通常将他们对特定物质的特定名称应用于由这种特定的真实本质所区分的事物。如果有人怀疑他是否称自己为人，除了具有人的真正本质外，还有什么人不会认为有什么不妥？然而，如果你问这些真正的本质是什么，很明显，人是无知的，不知道它们。由此可见，他们头脑中的观念，如果是指真正的本质，就像指未知的原型一样，一定是远远不够的，以至于不能被认为是它们的任何代表。我们对物质的复杂观念，正如已经表明的那样，是已经被观察到的或被认为不断存在的简单观念的某些集合。但这样一个复杂的观念不可能是任何物质的真正本质；因为那样的话，我们在那个身体中发现的属性将取决于那个复杂的观念，并可从它推导出来，而且它们与它的必然联系是已知的；正如一个三角形的所有属性取决于，而且就它们可被发现而言，是可从包括一个空间的三条线的复杂观念中推导出来。但显而易见的是，在我们对物质的复杂观念中，并不包含这样的观念，而在这些观念中可以发现的所有其他品质都取决于此。人们对铁的共同概念是：具有某种颜色、重量和硬度的物体；他们认为属于铁的一个特性是可塑性。但是，这一特性与这一复杂的概念或其任何部分都没有必然的联系：没有更多的理由认为可塑性取决于颜色、重量和硬度，而不是颜色或重量取决于其可塑性。然而，尽管我们对这些真正的本质一无所知，但没有什么比人们将事物的种类归于这些本质更普通的了。大多数人都认为我手指上的戒指是由特定的物质组成的，它有一个真正的本质，因此它是金子；我在它身上发现的那些品质就来自于此，即它独特的颜色、重量、硬度、可熔性、固定性以及在轻微接触水银时的颜色变化，等等。当我探究它和寻找它时，我清楚地意识到我无法发现这个本质：我所能做的只是假定，它只是身体，其真正的本质或内部结构，即这些品质所依赖的，只能是其固体部分的形状、大小和联系；我对这两者都没有任何明显的感知，因此无法对其本质有任何概念。这就是它具有那种特别闪亮的黄色的原因；比我所知道的同样体积的任何东西都要重；而且适合用流银的触摸来改变其颜色。如果有人说，这些特性所依赖的真正的本质和内部结构，不是它的实体部分的形状、大小和排列或联系，而是其他的东西，叫做它的特殊形式，那么我就比以前更不了解它的真正本质了。因为我对一般固体部分的形状、大小和情况有概念，但我对产生上述品质的特定形状、大小或部件的组合没有概念；我在我手指上的那个特定的物质包裹中发现了这些品质，而在另一个物质包裹中没有发现，我用它来切割我的笔。但是，当我被告知，除了那个身体的实体部分的形状、大小和姿势之外，还有一种叫做 "实质性形式 "的东西，我承认我根本不知道，只知道声音的形式；这与它真正的本质或结构的想法相去甚远。像我对这种特殊物质的真正本质一无所知一样，我对所有其他自然物质的真正本质也是如此：对于这些本质，我承认我根本没有明确的概念；而且，我很可能认为，其他人在审查自己的知识时，会发现自己在这一点上也有同样的无知。</p>

If it be so, as it is plain it is, the name by which things are marked as having that essence must be referred primarily to that essence; and consequently the idea to which that name is given must be referred also to that essence, and be intended to represent it.

Because those qualities and powers of substances, whereof we make their complex ideas, are so many and various, that no man’s complex idea contains them all. That our complex ideas of substances do not contain in them ALL the simple ideas that are united in the things themselves is evident, in that men do rarely put into their complex idea of any substance all the simple ideas they do know to exist in it. Because, endeavouring to make the signification of their names as clear and as little cumbersome as they can, they make their specific ideas of the sorts of substance, for the most part, of a few of those simple ideas which are to be found in them: but these having no original precedency, or right to be put in, and make the specific idea, more than others that are left out, it is plain that both these ways our ideas of substances are deficient and inadequate. The simple ideas whereof we make our complex ones of substances are all of them (bating only the figure and bulk of some sorts) powers; which being relations to other substances, we can never be sure that we know ALL the powers that are in any one body, till we have tried what changes it is fitted to give to or receive from other substances in their several ways of application: which being impossible to be tried upon any one body, much less upon all, it is impossible we should have adequate ideas of any substance made up of a collection of all its properties.</p>

Therefore those never went into his idea of that species of body; but its peculiar colour, perhaps, and weight, were the first he abstracted from it, to make the complex idea of that species. Which both are but powers; the one to affect our eyes after such a manner, and to produce in us that idea we call yellow; and the other to force upwards any other body of equal bulk, they being put into a pair of equal scales, one against another. Another perhaps added to these the ideas of fusibility and fixedness, two other passive powers, in relation to the operation of fire upon it; another, its ductility and solubility in aqua regia, two other powers, relating to the operation of other bodies, in changing its outward figure, or separation of it into insensible parts.

The changes that that one body is apt to receive, and make in other bodies, upon a due application, exceeding far not only what we know, but what we are apt to imagine.

		<p class="calibre5 en">First, SIMPLE ideas, which are [word in Greek] or copies; but yet certainly adequate. Because, being intended to express nothing but the power in things to produce in the mind such a sensation, that sensation, when it is produced, cannot but be the effect of that power. So the paper I write on, having the power in the light (I speak according to the common notion of light) to produce in men the sensation which I call white, it cannot but be the effect of such a power in something without the mind; since the mind has not the power to produce any such idea in itself: and being meant for nothing else but the effect of such a power that simple idea is [* words missing] the sensation of white, in my mind, being the effect of that power which is in the paper to produce it, is perfectly adequate to that power; or else that power would produce a different idea.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">首先，简单的概念，它是[希腊语中的字]或副本；但肯定是充分的。因为，它只想表达事物在心灵中产生这种感觉的能力，而这种感觉一旦产生，就不能不说是这种能力的结果。因此，我所写的纸，在光中有能力（我是根据光的普通概念说的）在人心中产生我称之为白色的感觉，它不能不说是这种能力在没有心灵的东西中的效果；因为心灵本身没有能力产生任何这样的想法：而且，由于只想表达这种能力的效果，那个简单的想法就是[*缺字]白色的感觉，在我心中，是纸中产生它的那种能力的效果，完全适合于这种能力；否则这种能力会产生一种别的想法。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Secondly, the COMPLEX ideas of SUBSTANCES are ectypes, copies too; but not perfect ones, not adequate: which is very evident to the mind, in that it plainly perceives, that whatever collection of simple ideas it makes of any substance that exists, it cannot be sure that it exactly answers all that are in that substance. Since, not having tried all the operations of all other substances upon it, and found all the alterations it would receive from, or cause in, other substances, it cannot have an exact adequate collection of all its active and passive capacities; and so not have an adequate complex idea of the powers of any substance existing, and its relations; which is that sort of complex idea of substances we have. And, after all, if we would have, and actually had, in our complex idea, an exact collection of all the secondary qualities or powers of any substance, we should not yet thereby have an idea of the ESSENCE of that thing. For, since the powers or qualities that are observable by us are not the real essence of that substance, but depend on it, and flow from it, any collection whatsoever of these qualities cannot be the real essence of that thing. Whereby it is plain, that our ideas of substances are not adequate; are not what the mind intends them to be. Besides, a man has no idea of substance in general, nor knows what substance is in itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">第二，物质的复合观念也是异型的，也是复制的；但不是完美的，不是充分的：这对心灵来说是非常明显的，因为它清楚地认识到，无论它对任何存在的物质进行简单观念的收集，它都不能确定它完全回答了该物质中的所有问题。因为它没有尝试过所有其他物质对它的作用，也没有发现它从其他物质中得到的或在其他物质中引起的所有变化，所以它不可能准确地充分收集它所有的主动和被动能力；因此也不可能对任何存在的物质的能力及其关系有一个充分的复杂概念；这就是我们对物质的那种复杂概念。而且，毕竟，如果我们在我们的复杂概念中拥有，而且实际上拥有，任何物质的所有次要品质或权力的精确集合，我们还不应该因此而拥有那个东西的本质的概念。因为，既然我们可以观察到的能力或品质不是该物质的真正本质，而是取决于它，并从它那里流出来，那么这些品质的任何集合都不可能是该事物的真正本质。由此可见，我们对物质的观念是不充分的；不是心灵所要的。此外，一个人对一般的物质没有概念，也不知道物质本身是什么。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Though truth and falsehood belong, in propriety of speech, only to PROPOSITIONS: yet IDEAS are oftentimes termed true or false (as what words are there that are not used with great latitude, and with some deviation from their strict and proper significations?) Though I think that when ideas themselves are termed true or false, there is still some secret or tacit proposition, which is the foundation of that denomination: as we shall see, if we examine the particular occasions wherein they come to be called true or false. In all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation, which is the reason of that denomination. For our ideas, being nothing but bare APPEARANCES, or perceptions in our minds, cannot properly and simply in themselves be said to be true or false, no more than a single name of anything can be said to be true or false.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">虽然从言语的角度来说，真理和谬误只属于提议，但思想却经常被称为真或假（因为有什么词在使用时没有很大的自由度，并偏离其严格和适当的含义？）虽然我认为，当观念本身被称为真或假时，仍有一些秘密或默示的命题，这是这种称谓的基础：如果我们研究一下它们被称为真或假的特定场合，就会发现。在所有这些场合中，我们都会发现某种肯定或否定，这就是这种命名的原因。因为我们的观念，只不过是赤裸裸的表象，或者说是我们头脑中的感知，其本身不能正确而简单地被说成是真或假，就像任何事物的单一名称不能被说成是真或假一样。</p>

For truth or falsehood lying always in some affirmation or negation, mental or verbal, our ideas are not capable, any of them, of being false, till the mind passes some judgment on them; that is, affirms or denies something of them.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">但是，当我们在这里研究我们的观念是否能够成为真实或虚假时，并不是在这种形而上学意义上的真理，而是在这些词的更普通的意义上：所以我说，我们头脑中的观念，只是在那里的许多感知或表象，它们没有一个是虚假的；半人马的观念在我们头脑中出现时，并不像半人马这个名字在我们口中念出或写在纸上时有虚假的成分。因为真理或谬误总是在于某种肯定或否定，精神的或语言的，我们的观念不可能，其中任何一个都是虚假的，直到头脑对它们作出某种判断；也就是说，肯定或否定它们的某些东西。</p>

For the natural tendency of the mind being towards knowledge; and finding that, if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular things, its progress would be very slow, and its work endless; therefore, to shorten its way to knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first thing it does, as the foundation of the easier enlarging its knowledge, either by contemplation of the things themselves that it would know, or conference with others about them, is to bind them into bundles, and rank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort; and so advance by larger steps in that which is its great business, knowledge.

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">心灵对自己的想法很容易默许这些假设。但是，如果我们研究一下，就会发现它主要是，如果不是仅仅是，关于它的抽象的复杂想法。因为思想的自然倾向是走向知识；并且发现，如果它只通过和停留在特定的事物上，它的进展将是非常缓慢的，它的工作是无止境的。因此，为了缩短它的求知之路，并使每一种认识更加全面，它所做的第一件事，作为更容易扩大其知识的基础，无论是通过对它想知道的事物本身的思考，还是与他人讨论这些事物，都是把它们捆成一捆，并把它们分成各种类型，以便它对其中任何一种事物的认识，都可以放心地扩展到该类型的所有事物；这样，在其伟大的事业--知识方面，就可以迈出更大的步伐。正如我在其他地方所表明的那样，这就是我们为什么要在综合概念下收集事物，并把它们附以名称，分为属和种；即分为种类和类别的原因。</p>

Hence it is, that we may often observe that, when any one sees a new thing of a kind that he knows not, he presently asks, what it is; meaning by that inquiry nothing but the name.

But yet SIMPLE IDEAS are least of all liable to be so mistaken. Because a man, by his senses and every day’s observation, may easily satisfy himself what the simple ideas are which their several names that are in common use stand for; they being but few in number, and such as, if he doubts or mistakes in, he may easily rectify by the objects they are to be found in. Therefore it is seldom that any one mistakes in his names of simple ideas, or applies the name red to the idea green, or the name sweet to the idea bitter: much less are men apt to confound the names of ideas belonging to different senses, and call a colour by the name of a taste, &amp;c.

But in mixed modes we are much more uncertain; it being not so easy to determine of several actions, whether they are to be called JUSTICE or CRUELTY, LIBERALITY or PRODIGALITY.

Nor do they become liable to any imputation of falsehood, if the mind (as in most men I believe it does) judges these ideas to be in the things themselves. For God in his wisdom having set them as marks of distinction in things, whereby we may be able to discern one thing from another, and so choose any of them for our uses as we have occasion; it alters not the nature of our simple idea, whether we think that the idea of blue be in the violet itself, or in our mind only; and only the power of producing it by the texture of its parts, reflecting the particles of light after a certain manner, to be in the violet itself. For that texture in the object, by a regular and constant operation producing the same idea of blue in us, it serves us to distinguish, by our eyes, that from any other thing; whether that distinguishing mark, as it is really in the violet, be only a peculiar texture of parts, or else that very colour, the idea whereof (which is in us) is the exact resemblance. And it is equally from that appearance to be denominated blue, whether it be that real colour, or only a peculiar texture in it, that causes in us that idea: since the name, BLUE, notes properly nothing but that mark of distinction that is in a violet, discernible only by our eyes, whatever it consists in; that being beyond our capacities distinctly to know, and perhaps would be of less use to us, if we had faculties to discern.</p>

For, since this could never be known, because one man’s mind could not pass into another man’s body, to perceive what appearances were produced by those organs; neither the ideas hereby, nor the names, would be at all confounded, or any falsehood be in either. For all things that had the texture of a violet, producing constantly the idea that he called blue, and those which had the texture of a marigold, producing constantly the idea which he as constantly called yellow, whatever those appearances were in his mind; he would be able as regularly to distinguish things for his use by those appearances, and understand and signify those distinctions marked by the name blue and yellow, as if the appearances or ideas in his mind received from those two flowers were exactly the same with the ideas in other men’s minds. I am nevertheless very apt to think that the sensible ideas produced by any object in different men’s minds, are most commonly very near and undiscernibly alike. For which opinion, I think, there might be many reasons offered: but that being besides my present business, I shall not trouble my reader with them; but only mind him, that the contrary supposition, if it could be proved, is of little use, either for the improvement of our knowledge, or conveniency of life, and so we need not trouble ourselves to examine it.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">如果由于我们器官的不同结构，同一物体同时在不同人的头脑中产生不同的观念，这也不会给我们的简单观念带来任何错误的指责；例如，如果一个人的眼睛在一个人的头脑中产生的紫罗兰的观念与另一个人的万寿菊产生的观念相同，反之亦然。因为，这一点永远无法知道，因为一个人的思想无法进入另一个人的身体，无法感知这些器官所产生的表象；无论是这里的观念，还是这里的名称，都不会被混淆，也不会有任何虚假。因为所有具有紫罗兰质地的东西，不断产生他称之为蓝色的观念，那些具有金盏花质地的东西，不断产生他称之为黄色的观念，无论这些表象在他的头脑中是什么；他都能经常通过这些表象来区分供他使用的东西，并理解和表示那些以蓝色和黄色为标志的区别，就好像他头脑中从这两种花中得到的表象或观念与其他人头脑中的观念完全相同一样。然而，我非常倾向于认为，任何物体在不同人的头脑中产生的感性观念，最常见的是非常接近和无法辨别的相同。对于这个观点，我认为可以提出很多理由：但这不在我目前的业务范围之内，我不会用这些理由来麻烦我的读者；而只是提醒他，相反的假设，如果能够被证明，无论是对我们知识的提高，还是对生活的便利，都没有什么用处，所以我们不需要麻烦自己去研究它。</p>

Blue and yellow, bitter or sweet, can never be false ideas: these perceptions in the mind are just such as they are there, answering the powers appointed by God to produce them; and so are truly what they are, and are intended to be.

Thus, when I have the idea of such an action of a man who forbears to afford himself such meat, drink, and clothing, and other conveniences of life, as his riches and estate will be sufficient to supply and his station requires, I have no false idea; but such an one as represents an action, either as I find or imagine it, and so is capable of neither truth nor falsehood. But when I give the name FRUGALITY or VIRTUE to this action, then it may be called a false idea, if thereby it be supposed to agree with that idea to which, in propriety of speech, the name of frugality doth belong, or to be conformable to that law which is the standard of virtue and vice.</p>

That they are all false, when looked upon as the representations of the unknown essences of things, is so evident that there needs nothing to be said of it. I shall therefore pass over that chimerical supposition, and consider them as collections of simple ideas in the mind, taken from combinations of simple ideas existing together constantly in things, of which patterns they are the supposed copies; and in this reference of them to the existence of things, they are false ideas:—(1) When they put together simple ideas, which in the real existence of things have no union; as when to the shape and size that exist together in a horse, is joined in the same complex idea the power of barking like a dog: which three ideas, however put together into one in the mind, were never united in nature; and this, therefore, may be called a false idea of a horse. (2) Ideas of substances are, in this respect, also false, when, from any collection of simple ideas that do always exist together, there is separated, by a direct negation, any other simple idea which is constantly joined with them. Thus, if to extension, solidity, fusibility, the peculiar weightiness, and yellow colour of gold, any one join in his thoughts the negation of a greater degree of fixedness than is in lead or copper, he may be said to have a false complex idea, as well as when he joins to those other simple ones the idea of perfect absolute fixedness. For either way, the complex idea of gold being made up of such simple ones as have no union in nature, may be termed false. But, if he leaves out of this his complex idea that of fixedness quite, without either actually joining to or separating it from the rest in his mind, it is, I think, to be looked on as an inadequate and imperfect idea, rather than a false one; since, though it contains not all the simple ideas that are united in nature, yet it puts none together but what do really exist together.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">第三，我们对物质的复杂概念，由于都是指事物本身的模式，可能是错误的。如果把它们看作是事物的未知本质的表征，那么它们都是虚假的，这一点是非常明显的，不需要说什么了。因此，我将抛开这种嵌合式的假设，把它们看作是头脑中简单观念的集合，取自事物中不断存在的简单观念的组合，它们是这些模式的假定副本；在它们与事物存在的这种参照中，它们是虚假的观念。-(1) 当他们把在事物的真实存在中没有结合的简单观念放在一起时；例如，在马的形状和大小上，在同一个复杂的观念中加入了像狗一样吠叫的能力：这三个观念虽然在头脑中结合成一个，但在自然界中从未结合过；因此，这可称为马的虚假观念。(2) 在这方面，物质的观念也是虚假的，如果从任何总是一起存在的简单观念的集合中，通过直接的否定，分离出任何其他经常与之结合的简单观念。因此，如果任何人在他的思想中对黄金的延伸性、坚固性、可熔性、特殊的重量和黄色加入了对比铅或铜更大程度的固定性的否定，那么他可以说有一个虚假的复合概念，就像他把完美的绝对固定性的概念加入那些其他简单的概念一样。因为无论如何，黄金的复合概念是由自然界中没有结合的简单概念组成的，可以说是虚假的。但是，如果他把固定性这个复杂的概念完全排除在外，而没有在他的头脑中实际加入或从其他概念中分离出来，我认为，这应该被看作是一个不充分和不完善的概念，而不是一个虚假的概念；因为，尽管它不包含所有在自然界中结合的简单概念，但它没有把任何一个概念放在一起，而是真正存在于一起。</p>

But yet, if, having framed such an idea in my mind, without thinking either that existence, or the name MAN or TARTAR, belongs to it, I will call it MAN or TARTAR, I may be justly thought fantastical in the naming; but not erroneous in my judgment; nor the idea any way false.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">总而言之，一个人对他以外的任何事物都没有概念，只是通过他心中的想法，（这种想法他有权用他喜欢的名称来称呼），他确实可以产生一种既不符合事物的原因，也不符合其他人通常所表示的想法的想法；但不能对一个除了他对它的想法以外没有其他认识的事物产生错误或虚假的想法：V.g. 当我把一个人的腿、胳膊和身体构思出来，再加上马的头和脖子，我不会对任何东西产生错误的概念；因为没有我，它什么都不代表。但是，当我称它为人或马，并把它想象成代表某个没有我的真实存在，或者是别人用同样的名字称呼的同一个概念；在这两种情况中，我都可能犯错。在这两种情况下，我都可能犯错。因此，它被称为错误的观念；尽管错误不在于观念，而在于那个默示的心理主张，即把它归结为一种它所没有的符合和相似。但是，如果我在头脑中构思了这样一个概念，而不认为存在，也不认为 "人 "或 "鞑靼 "这个名字属于它，我就把它叫做 "人 "或 "鞑靼"，那么我就有理由认为我的命名是幻想的；但在我的判断中并没有错误；这个概念也不可能是错误的。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Upon the whole matter, I think that our ideas, as they are considered by the mind,—either in reference to the proper signification of their names; or in reference to the reality of things,—may very fitly be called RIGHT or WRONG ideas, according as they agree or disagree to those patterns to which they are referred. But if any one had rather call them true or false, it is fit he use a liberty, which every one has, to call things by those names he thinks best; though, in propriety of speech, TRUTH or FALSEHOOD will, I think, scarce agree to them, but as they, some way or other, virtually contain in them some mental proposition. The ideas that are in a man’s mind, simply considered, cannot be wrong; unless complex ones, wherein inconsistent parts are jumbled together. All other ideas are in themselves right, and the knowledge about them right and true knowledge; but when we come to refer them to anything, as to their patterns and archetypes then they are capable of being wrong, as far as they disagree with such archetypes.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">就整个问题而言，我认为，我们的观念，正如它们在头脑中所考虑的那样，无论是参照其名称的适当含义，还是参照事物的现实，都可以非常恰当地被称为正确的或错误的观念，因为它们与它们所参照的模式一致或不一致。但是，如果有人宁愿称它们为真或假，那么他就应该利用每个人都有的自由，用他认为最好的名字来称呼事物；尽管在说话的恰当性方面，我认为真理或谬误几乎不可能与它们相一致，但因为它们在某种程度上实际上包含着一些心理命题。一个人头脑中的想法，简单来说，不可能是错误的；除非是复杂的想法，其中不一致的部分被混在一起。所有其他的想法本身是正确的，关于它们的知识也是正确的和真正的知识；但是当我们把它们与任何东西联系起来，与它们的模式和原型联系起来时，它们就有可能是错误的，因为它们与这种原型不一致。</p>

I do not here mean when he is under the power of an unruly passion, but in the steady calm course of his life. That which will yet more apologize for this harsh name, and ungrateful imputation on the greatest part of mankind, is, that, inquiring a little by the bye into the nature of madness, (b. ii. ch. xi., Section 13,) I found it to spring from the very same root, and to depend on the very same cause we are here speaking of. This consideration of the thing itself, at a time when I thought not I the least on the subject which I am now treating of, suggested it to me. And if this be a weakness to which all men are so liable, if this be a taint which so universally infects mankind, the greater care should be taken to lay it open under its due name, thereby to excite the greater care in its prevention and cure.</p>

</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">Some of our ideas have a NATURAL correspondence and connexion one with another: it is the office and excellency of our reason to trace these, and hold them together in that union and correspondence which is founded in their peculiar beings. Besides this, there is another connexion of ideas wholly owing to CHANCE or CUSTOM. Ideas that in themselves are not all of kin, come to be so united in some men’s minds, that it is very hard to separate them; they always keep in company, and the one no sooner at any time comes into the understanding, but its associate appears with it; and if they are more than two which are thus united, the whole gang, always inseparable, show themselves together.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们的一些观念有一种自然的对应关系和联系：我们的理性的职责和优势是追踪这些观念，并将它们结合在一起，建立在它们特有的生命中的对应关系。除此之外，还有一种观念的联系完全是由于 "机会 "或 "习惯 "造成的。在一些人的头脑中，那些本身并不完全是亲属的观念是如此地结合在一起，以至于很难将它们分开；它们总是结伴而行，一个人在任何时候都会很快进入人们的理解，而它的同伙也会随之出现；如果它们有两个以上是这样结合在一起的，那么整个团伙，总是不可分割的，会一起出现。</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">This strong combination of ideas, not allied by nature, the mind makes in itself either voluntarily or by chance; and hence it comes in different men to be very different, according to their different inclinations, education, interests, &amp;c. CUSTOM settles habits of thinking in the understanding, as well as of determining in the will, and of motions in the body: all which seems to be but trains of motions in the animal spirits, which, once set a going, continue in the same steps they have been used to; which, by often treading, are worn into a smooth path, and the motion in it becomes easy, and as it were natural. As far as we can comprehend thinking, thus ideas seem to be produced in our minds; or, if they are not, this may serve to explain their following one another in an habitual train, when once they are put into their track, as well as it does to explain such motions of the body. A musician used to any tune will find that, let it but once begin in his head, the ideas of the several notes of it will follow one another orderly in his understanding, without any care or attention, as regularly as his fingers move orderly over the keys of the organ to play out the tune he has begun, though his unattentive thoughts be elsewhere a wandering. Whether the natural cause of these ideas, as well as of that regular dancing of his fingers be the motion of his animal spirits, I will not determine, how probable soever, by this instance, it appears to be so: but this may help us a little to conceive of intellectual habits, and of the tying together of ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这种强烈的思想组合，不是自然形成的，是心灵自己自愿或偶然形成的；因此，它在不同的人身上，根据他们不同的倾向、教育、兴趣等等，而变得非常不同。习惯使人在理解中养成思考的习惯，在意志中养成决定的习惯，在身体中养成运动的习惯：所有这些似乎都是动物精神中的一连串运动，这些运动一旦开始，就会按照它们所习惯的步骤继续下去；这些运动由于经常踩踏，被磨成一条光滑的道路，其中的运动变得容易，而且自然。就我们能够理解的思维而言，这样的想法似乎是在我们的头脑中产生的；或者，如果它们不是，这可能有助于解释它们在习惯性的火车上彼此相随，当它们一旦被放入它们的轨道时，也有助于解释身体的这种运动。一个习惯于任何曲子的音乐家会发现，只要让它在他的脑海中开始，它的几个音符的想法就会在他的理解中有序地相互跟随，而不需要任何关心或注意，就像他的手指有序地在风琴的琴键上移动，弹出他已经开始的曲子，尽管他不专心的思想在其他地方徘徊。这些想法以及他的手指有规律地舞动的自然原因是否是他的动物精神的运动，我不会确定，无论如何，通过这个例子，它似乎是这样的：但这可能有助于我们对智力的习惯和想法的捆绑有一点概念。</p>

<div class="bottom">
<div class="top left">
		<p class="calibre5 en">That there are such associations of them made by custom, in the minds of most men, I think nobody will question, who has well considered himself or others; and to this, perhaps, might be justly attributed most of the sympathies and antipathies observable in men, which work as strongly, and produce as regular effects as if they were natural; and are therefore called so, though they at first had no other original but the accidental connexion of two ideas, which either the strength of the first impression, or future indulgence so united, that they always afterwards kept company together in that man’s mind, as if they were but one idea. I say most of the antipathies, I do not say all; for some of them are truly natural, depend upon our original constitution, and are born with us; but a great part of those which are counted natural, would have been known to be from unheeded, though perhaps early, impressions, or wanton fancies at first, which would have been acknowledged the original of them, if they had been warily observed. A grown person surfeiting with honey no sooner hears the name of it, but his fancy immediately carries sickness and qualms to his stomach, and he cannot bear the very idea of it; other ideas of dislike, and sickness, and vomiting, presently accompany it, and he is disturbed; but he knows from whence to date this weakness, and can tell how he got this indisposition. Had this happened to him by an over-dose of honey when a child, all the same effects would have followed; but the cause would have been mistaken, and the antipathy counted natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">在大多数人的头脑中都有这样的习惯性联想，我想没有人会质疑，只要他仔细考虑过自己或他人；也许可以把人身上可以观察到的大多数同情和反感归因于此，这些同情和反感的作用和产生的效果就像它们是自然的一样强烈。因此被称为如此，尽管它们起初并没有其他的本源，只是两个观念的偶然联系，而这两个观念或者是第一印象的力量，或者是未来的放纵，如此地结合在一起，以至于它们后来总是在那个人的头脑中相伴，就好像它们只是一个观念一样。我说大多数反感，并不是说全部；因为有些反感是真正自然的，取决于我们原来的体质，是与生俱来的；但那些被认为是自然的反感中，有很大一部分会被知道是来自未被注意的，尽管可能是早期的印象，或最初的肆意狂想，如果他们被谨慎地观察，会被承认是它们的原始。一个成年的人，一听到蜂蜜的名字，他的幻想就会立即让他的胃感到不适和不舒服，他不能忍受这种想法；其他的想法，如不喜欢，生病，呕吐，很快就伴随着它，他很不安；但他知道从哪里来的这种弱点，并能告诉他如何得到这种不适。如果他在小时候因过量服用蜂蜜而发生这种情况，所有同样的影响都会随之而来；但原因是错误的，而反感是自然的。</p>

This is the time most susceptible of lasting impressions; and though those relating to the health of the body are by discreet people minded and fenced against, yet I am apt to doubt, that those which relate more peculiarly to the mind, and terminate in the understanding or passions, have been much less heeded than the thing deserves: nay, those relating purely to the understanding, have, as I suspect, been by most men wholly overlooked.</p>

<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">我提到这一点，并不是因为在目前的论证中需要很好地区分自然和后天的反感，而是出于另一个目的，即那些有孩子的人，或者负责教育他们的人，会认为值得他们勤奋地观察，并小心地防止年轻人头脑中的不适当的想法联系。这是一个最容易产生持久印象的时期；虽然那些与身体健康有关的东西被谨慎的人所注意并加以防范，但我很怀疑，那些与心灵有关的、以理解力或激情为终点的东西所受到的关注远远少于事情所应受到的关注：不，那些纯粹与理解力有关的东西，正如我怀疑的那样，被大多数人完全忽视了。</p>

And here we see the cause why time cures certain affections, which reason, though in the right, and allowed to be so, has not power over, nor is able against them to prevail with those who are apt to hearken to it in other cases. The death of a child that was the daily delight of its mother’s eyes, and joy of her soul, rends from her heart the whole comfort of her life, and gives her all the torment imaginable: use the consolations of reason in this case, and you were as good preach ease to one on the rack, and hope to allay, by rational discourses, the pain of his joints tearing asunder. Till time has by disuse separated the sense of that enjoyment and its loss, from the idea of the child returning to her memory, all representations, though ever so reasonable, are in vain; and therefore some in whom the union between these ideas is never dissolved, spend their lives in mourning, and carry an incurable sorrow to their graves.</p>

There are rooms convenient enough, that some men cannot study in, and fashions of vessels, which, though ever so clean and commodious, they cannot drink out of, and that by reason of some accidental ideas which are annexed to them, and make them offensive; and who is there that hath not observed some man to flag at the appearance, or in the company of some certain person not otherwise superior to him, but because, having once on some occasion got the ascendant, the idea of authority and distance goes along with that of the person, and he that has been thus subjected, is not able to separate them.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">许多孩子把他们在学校所受的痛苦归咎于他们被纠正的书本，所以把这些想法联系在一起，以至于书本成为他们的厌恶，他们在以后的一生中都不愿意学习和使用书本；因此阅读对他们来说成为一种折磨，否则他们可能会把阅读作为他们生活的最大乐趣。有一些房间足够方便，但有些人却不能在里面学习，还有一些时尚的容器，虽然很干净，很方便，但他们却不能用它来喝水，这是因为一些偶然的想法附在上面，使它们令人讨厌。有谁没有注意到，有些人一出现，或与某些不比他优越的人在一起，就会打起精神来，这是因为在某些场合下，他一旦占了上风，权威和距离的观念就会随着这个人的观念一起出现，而他也因此受到了影响，无法将它们分开。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Instances of this kind are so plentiful everywhere, that if I add one more, it is only for the pleasant oddness of it. It is of a young gentleman, who, having learnt to dance, and that to great perfection, there happened to stand an old trunk in the room where he learnt. The idea of this remarkable piece of household stuff had so mixed itself with the turns and steps of all his dances, that though in that chamber he could dance excellently well, yet it was only whilst that trunk was there; nor could he perform well in any other place, unless that or some such other trunk had its due position in the room. If this story shall be suspected to be dressed up with some comical circumstances, a little beyond precise nature, I answer for myself that I had it some years since from a very sober and worthy man, upon his own knowledge, as I report it; and I dare say there are very few inquisitive persons who read this, who have not met with accounts, if not examples, of this nature, that may parallel, or at least justify this.</p>
</div>
<div class="top right">
		<p class="calibre5 cn">这样的例子比比皆是，如果我再多说一个，那也只是因为它的愉快的奇特之处。有一位年轻的先生，在学会了跳舞，而且跳得很好的时候，碰巧在他学习的房间里放了一个旧箱子。这个非凡的家用物品的想法与他所有舞蹈的转折和步骤混为一体，尽管在那个房间里他可以跳得很好，但那只是当那个箱子在那里的时候；除非那个箱子或其他类似的箱子在房间里有它应有的位置，否则他在其他地方也不能表现得很好。如果这个故事被怀疑是用一些滑稽的情节装扮出来的，有点超出了准确的性质，我为自己回答，我是几年前从一个非常清醒和有价值的人那里得到的，根据他自己的知识，我报告了这个故事；我敢说，很少有好奇心强的人看到这个故事，如果不是例子，也没有遇到过这种性质的描述，可能与此平行，或者至少是证明。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Intellectual habits and defects this way contracted, are not less frequent and powerful, though less observed. Let the ideas of being and matter be strongly joined, either by education or much thought; whilst these are still combined in the mind, what notions, what reasonings, will there be about separate spirits? Let custom from the very childhood have joined figure and shape to the idea of God, and what absurdities will that mind be liable to about the Deity? Let the idea of infallibility be inseparably joined to any person, and these two constantly together possess the mind; and then one body in two places at once, shall unexamined be swallowed for a certain truth, by an implicit faith, whenever that imagined infallible person dictates and demands assent without inquiry.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found to establish the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of philosophy and religion; for we cannot imagine every one of their followers to impose wilfully on himself, and knowingly refuse truth offered by plain reason. Interest, though it does a great deal in the case, yet cannot be thought to work whole societies of men to so universal a perverseness, as that every one of them to a man should knowingly maintain falsehood: some at least must be allowed to do what all pretend to, i.e. to pursue truth sincerely; and therefore there must be something that blinds their understandings, and makes them not see the falsehood of what they embrace for real truth. That which thus captivates their reasons, and leads men of sincerity blindfold from common sense, will, when examined, be found to be what we are speaking of: some independent ideas, of no alliance to one another, are, by education, custom, and the constant din of their party, so coupled in their minds, that they always appear there together; and they can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were but one idea, and they operate as if they were so. This gives sense to jargon, demonstration to absurdities, and consistency to nonsense, and is the foundation of the greatest, I had almost said of all the errors in the world; or, if it does not reach so far, it is at least the most dangerous one, since, so far as it obtains, it hinders men from seeing and examining. When two things, in themselves disjoined, appear to the sight constantly united; if the eye sees these things riveted which are loose, where will you begin to rectify the mistakes that follow in two ideas that they have been accustomed so to join in their minds as to substitute one for the other, and, as I am apt to think, often without perceiving it themselves? This, whilst they are under the deceit of it, makes them incapable of conviction, and they applaud themselves as zealous champions for truth, when indeed they are contending for error; and the confusion of two different ideas, which a customary connexion of them in their minds hath to them made in effect but one, fills their heads with false views, and their reasonings with false consequences.</p>

		<p class="calibre5 cn">我们会发现，一些这样错误的、不自然的思想组合会在哲学和宗教的不同派别之间建立起不可调和的对立；因为我们无法想象他们的每一个追随者都会故意强加于自己，并有意拒绝由普通的理性提供的真理。尽管利益在这种情况下起了很大的作用，但我们不能认为它能使整个社会的人变得如此普遍的变态，以至于他们中的每一个人都明知故犯：至少必须允许一些人做所有人都假装做的事情，即真诚地追求真理；因此，一定有什么东西蒙蔽了他们的理解，使他们看不到他们所接受的真正真理的虚假性。这样吸引他们的理智，使真诚的人蒙蔽了常识的东西，一旦被检查，就会发现是我们所说的：一些独立的、彼此不相干的观念，由于教育、习俗和他们党派的不断喧嚣，在他们的头脑中如此结合，以至于它们总是一起出现在那里；他们在思想中不能把它们分开，就像它们只是一个观念一样，而且它们的运作就像它们是如此。这使行话有了意义，使荒谬有了证明，使废话有了一致性，是最大的，我几乎可以说是世界上所有错误的基础；或者，如果它没有达到这个程度，它至少是最危险的，因为，只要它得到了，它就阻碍了人们的观察和检查。当两件本身不相干的东西在视线中出现时，如果眼睛看到这些铆接在一起的东西是松散的，那么你将从哪里开始纠正他们习惯于在头脑中连接的两个想法中出现的错误，以便用一个代替另一个，而且，正如我很容易想到的那样，他们往往没有察觉到这一点？在他们受骗的时候，这使他们无法相信，他们为自己鼓掌，认为自己是真理的热心拥护者，而实际上他们是在为错误争辩；两种不同的观念的混淆，在他们的头脑中习惯性地把它们连在一起，实际上只是一种观念，使他们的头脑充满错误的观点，他们的推理充满错误的结果。</p>

		<p class="calibre5 en">Having thus given an account of the original, sorts, and extent of our IDEAS, with several other considerations about these (I know not whether I may say) instruments, or materials of our knowledge, the method I at first proposed to myself would now require that I should immediately proceed to show, what use the understanding makes of them, and what KNOWLEDGE we have by them. This was that which, in the first general view I had of this subject, was all that I thought I should have to do: but, upon a nearer approach, I find that there is so close a connexion between ideas and WORDS, and our abstract ideas and general words have so constant a relation one to another, that it is impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge, which all consists in propositions, without considering, first, the nature, use, and signification of Language; which, therefore, must be the business of the next Book.</p>

It<br class="calibre"/>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations<br class="calibre"/>from people in all walks of life.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br class="calibre"/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br class="calibre"/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br class="calibre"/>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project<br class="calibre"/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br class="calibre"/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future<br class="calibre"/>generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br class="calibre"/>Literary Archive Foundation<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br class="calibre"/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br class="calibre"/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br class="calibre"/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br class="calibre"/>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations<br class="calibre"/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br class="calibre"/>status with the IRS.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br class="calibre"/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br class="calibre"/>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br class="calibre"/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br class="calibre"/>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations<br class="calibre"/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND<br class="calibre"/>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular<br class="calibre"/>state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br class="calibre"/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br class="calibre"/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br class="calibre"/>approach us with offers to donate.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br class="calibre"/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br class="calibre"/>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br class="calibre"/>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other<br class="calibre"/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Professor Michael S.

For forty years, he produced and<br class="calibre"/>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of<br class="calibre"/>volunteer support.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br class="calibre"/>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in<br class="calibre"/>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not<br class="calibre"/>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper<br class="calibre"/>edition.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search<br class="calibre"/>facility: www.gutenberg.org<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br class="calibre"/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br class="calibre"/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br class="calibre"/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/><br class="calibre"/>
