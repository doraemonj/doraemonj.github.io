[{"categories":["通识教育"],"content":"This article is from a YouTube interview to Naval Ravicant. What’s your opinion on the current educational system? When I ask people in Twitter what they wanted to ask you this question came up a couple times, which was how would you fix it? What’s your opinion on the education system? And what are your thoughts around that? Naval Ravikant: I think there’s no question. It’s completely obsolete. Education system is a path-dependent outcome from the need for daycare, from the need for prisons, for college ange males who would otherwise overrun society, and cause a lot of havoc. The original medieval universities had guard towers that face inwards. For example, you have to put a curfew and then you need to lock up the young 18 year old males before they go out with sword and daggers and you know create trouble. So, college and schools and what the way we think about them they come from a time period when books were rare, knowledge was rare, babysitting was rare, crime was common, violence was prevalent, there was no such self-guided learning. So I think schools are just byproducts of these kinds of institutions. Now we have the internet, which is the greatest level of knowledge ever created completely interconnected. So it’s very easy to learn if you actually have the desire to learn, everything that’s on the internet you can go on Khan academy, you can get MIT and Yale lectures online, you can get all the coursework and you get interactivity, you can read blogs by brilliant people, we can read all these great books. So the ability to learn, the means of learning, the tools of learning are abundant and infinite. The desire to learn that’s incredibly scarce. I just don’t think that schools matter for self-motivated students, what the schools matter for is one is to keep the kids out of the parents care while the parents go to work. It creates socialization because kids want to be around their peers, and they want to learn how to operate society with their peers. But I think it’s purely learning you’re after that learning can be done much more either on your own to through the internet or by uniting through the internet with like-minded groups. So I think that’s one problem with the current educational system. The second problem is: what do you choose to learn? The current educational system has to have a one-size-fits-all model has to say you have to learn X now and then you have to learn Y. You know to give you examples where this is obsolete memorization. In the day and age of Google and smartphones, memorization is obsolete. Why should you be memorizing the battle Trafalgar, why you should be memorizing what the capital of this or that state? But we still put undue weight on that just because that’s the way it’s always been done. We’ve lived to a pre-google world. Another example is when we’re moving along at a certain pace, I’m sure 90 percent of your listeners have had this happen to them, which is they were learning mathematics and at some point they were keeping up they were doing arithmetic and they were doing geometry, then they did strigonometry then they precalculated the calc. And somewhere in there they got lost. Somewhere in there while building the massive edifice the logical structure that mathematics is. They missed one lesson. They missed one concept. They missed five classes. Their brain couldn’t think a certain way that something was being explained to them. It should have been explained visually, but it was being wxplaied numerically, or it should have been expressed symbolically, and it was being explained cartography. But they were not able to keep up, and the moment you lose that wrong in mathematics the moment you miss that wrong of the ladder, you can’t go to the next one, because now the next one the teacher’s like okey we’re done with pre-calculus now we’re moving on to calculus. You’re saying wait, I didn’t understand pre-calculus, and I understand how pre-calculus leads from trigonometry to calculus.

Skin in the Game —— Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life A 2018 nonfiction book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former options trader with a background in the mathematics of probability and statistics. 2. End of History and the Last Man A 1992 book of political philosophy by American political scientist Francis Fukuyama which argues that with the ascendancy of Western liberal democracy—which occurred after the Cold War (1945–1991) and the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991)—humanity has reached “not just … the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: That is, the end-point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.” —— from Wikipedia 3. The Discovery of Society This classic text explores the lives and ideas of the social thinkers who have shaped and continue to forge traditions in sociology. Focusing on the great names in the field, it weaves biographical and conceptual details into a tapestry of the history of social thought of the 19th and 20th centuries. Written in a narrative style that is accessible and exciting, this text serves as an excellent supplement for courses in social and sociological theory, the history of social thought, the history of sociology, and introduction to sociology. 4. A Treatise of Human Nature Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects (1739–40) is a book by Scottish philosopher David Hume, considered by many to be Hume’s most important work and one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.[1] The Treatise is a classic statement of philosophical empiricism, scepticism, and naturalism. In the introduction Hume presents the idea of placing all science and philosophy on a novel foundation: namely, an empirical investigation into human nature. Impressed by Isaac Newton’s achievements in the physical sciences, Hume sought to introduce the same experimental method of reasoning into the study of human psychology, with the aim of discovering the “extent and force of human understanding”. 5. An Essay Concerning Human Understanding An Essay Concerning Human Understanding is a work by John Locke concerning the foundation of human knowledge and understanding. It first appeared in 1689 (although dated 1690) with the printed title An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. He describes the mind at birth as a blank slate (tabula rasa, although he did not use those actual words) filled later through experience. The essay was one of the principal sources of empiricism in modern philosophy, and influenced many enlightenment philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley. 6. The Economist The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in demitab format and published digitally that focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, technology, and culture. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by The Economist Group, with core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across its social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.

We use: ​ .shape to lookup the shape of an array ​ .dim to lookup the dimensions One-demension arrays We create a one-dimension array in Python Console with inputting this command: np.array([1,2,3], dtype=float) One dimension array is also named “vector”. We get feedback immediately: array([1., 2., 3.]) This is our first one dimension array, aka “vector”. It’s useful, but not now. Two-demension arrays Then, let’s make a two dimension array with Numpy: np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]) Feedback from Python: array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) This is a two dimension array. Arithmetic progression arrays Also, we made an arithmetic progression with a step length of 0.5: np.arange(0,3,0.5) Feedback from Python: array([0. , 0.5, 1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5]) As most functions in Python, it will take the start para into account but not take the last one, so this array is not included the number 3.
